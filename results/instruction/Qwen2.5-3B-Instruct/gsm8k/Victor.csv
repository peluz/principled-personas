"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the number of eggs left for sale is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of fiber required for both the blue and white fibers and then sum them up.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means it takes \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts of blue and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is 3.

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

The initial value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the total cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

The profit Josh made is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 195,000 \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters long. Therefore, each day he runs a total of \(3 \times 60 = 180\) meters. Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is \(180 \times 3 = 540\) meters.

The final numerical answer is 540."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8. Since 16 glasses form 8 pairs, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 20
   \]

2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep**: To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB, so 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the entire 200 GB file again.
   - The time to download the entire 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute is \(200 \div 2 = 100\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each part:
- Time for the first 40% of the download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update installation: 20 minutes
- Time to download the entire file again: 100 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 100 = 160\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 160 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and the first 2 hours were in traffic)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 475 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate the earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate the earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate, which is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to get the total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
\[ \text{Final numerical answer} = \$460 \]"

The final numerical answer is 694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue from lemons - Annual cost of maintenance
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90.

So, we set up the inequality:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}\]
\[n \geq 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by going through the steps:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

The calculations confirm that Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Finally, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after those who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance have been accounted for:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Market growth rate: 2.5% or 0.025 in decimal form
- Future value of jewelry = Current value * (1 + growth rate)
- Future value of jewelry = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Market growth rate: 1.2% or 0.012 in decimal form
- Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value * (1 + growth rate)
- Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
- Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."

Step 3: Over 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking.
2. Determine the total distance she needs to cover.
3. Calculate the remaining distance she needs to walk.
4. Determine the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. Therefore, the total time she wants to spend hiking is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another 1 hour walking the next 2 miles. So, the time she has already spent hiking is:

\[ \text{Time already spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

This means the remaining time she has to spend hiking is:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we need to determine the remaining distance. The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance is:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the remaining distance and the remaining time:

\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

After pouring the orange drink, we spill one liter, so we have:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters of orange drink} \]

The total volume of the mixture after adding the orange drink to the pineapple drink is:

\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture. The total amount of water from the orange drink is \(\frac{20}{3}\) liters, and the total amount of water from the pineapple drink is 9 liters. Therefore, the total amount of water in the mixture is:

\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \]

To provide the final numerical answer:

\[ \boxed{\frac{47}{3}} \]"

- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Adding these together gives the total number of DVDs sold:
\[3 + 4 + 0 = 7\]

Therefore, the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time the candle burns and then use the rate at which the candle melts.

The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we can calculate the total melting as follows:

\[ \text{Total melting} = \text{Rate of melting} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Total melting} = 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Total melting} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

The cost of the shorts is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

The cost of the pants is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50 \]

The cost of the shoes is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[ \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243 \]

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, so the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the distance to his second stop and the distance to his first stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 104 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The sum of their ages is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[109\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + (0.25 \times 80) = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours John spends on one dog per day.
2. Multiply the daily hours for one dog by the number of dogs.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. John takes care of 10 dogs.

First, calculate the total hours for one day:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, calculate the total hours for one week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Adding the points from both periods, the total points Mike scored is \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to meet this number.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set.

First, Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

The price for 4 yogurts is $5.00. Therefore, the cost for 15 sets is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Finally, since John did not sell any lego sets after the initial sale, he still has all 13 lego sets.

\[ \text{Number of lego sets John still has} = 13 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"To find John's running speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the total distance John runs in a week:
- He runs 60 miles in total.
- He runs 3 days a week.

Next, let's calculate the time he spends running each day:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day + Time on the third day
- Total time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
- Total time = 6 hours

Now we can calculate John's running speed. Speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time:
- Speed = Total distance / Total time
- Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
- Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 \text{ miles per hour} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving of chips has 250 calories.

To find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since one serving is 300 grams, we can find out how many grams of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can determine the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \$20.00 \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package is the sum of the initial notes and the notes in the new package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes and having 23 left, the equation representing the total number of Post-it notes is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we can find the total amount John spent on ties by adding the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's determine the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to determine how many eggs Lloyd sells per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen and he sells them for $2 per dozen, we can calculate the daily revenue from eggs as follows:

The time it takes to travel back is \( \frac{D}{6} \) hours. Since the question only provides the speed for the return trip and does not specify the distance, we cannot determine the exact time for the return trip.

Given the information provided, the time it takes to get back cannot be calculated. Therefore, the final numerical answer cannot be determined from the given data."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Insurance cost
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130 = $1430

The final numerical answer is $1430."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
   - For 20 years, the total pension amount is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000
     \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the pension for the first 20 years at $50,000 per year and the next 10 years at $50,000 per year as well.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service is:
\[
50,000
\]"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half = $140/month * 6 months = $840.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The service charges 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The reduced monthly charge = $140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126.
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half = $126/month * 6 months = $756.

3. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first half + Cost for the second half = $840 + $756 = $1596.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip. Since she needed 4 gallons to refill her 12-gallon tank, she currently has:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the 8 gallons of gas she currently has. We know that she drove 100 miles with 4 gallons, so the miles per gallon (mpg) for her car is:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

With 8 gallons of gas, she can drive:

\[ 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ \text{Total cost without interest} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and Shiela has five units:

\[ \text{Interest per unit} = 2\% \times \$150 = 0.02 \times \$150 = \$3 \]

Since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 5 \times \$3 = \$15 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost without interest to get the total installment cost:

\[ \text{Total installment cost} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months. To find out how much she will pay each month, we divide the total installment cost by 3:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

Now, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Add the amounts of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, determine how many bags of dog food are needed. Since each bag contains 110 cups:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} = 9 - 6 = 3 \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes based on the volume before cooking.

First, we know that the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, and this volume is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16-ounce cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Thus, the number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars exited the motorway, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
- The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the last 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\). Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \(x + 20\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits, we can set up the equation:
\[x + 20 = 25\]

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[x = 25 - 20\]
\[x = 5\]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final numerical answer is:

She receives 18 more potted plants from the nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:
\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away:
\[ 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 58 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum up all the doorbell presses:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell presses = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday through Friday):
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Before bed

That's 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

So, for 5 weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks a soda with dinner instead of water:
- Dinner

That's 1 glass of water per day on weekends.

So, for 2 weekend days:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total distance the fog bank needs to cover:**
   The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

2. **Determine the rate at which the fog bank covers the city:**
   The fog bank covers every 3 miles in 10 minutes.

3. **Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:**
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time required to cover all segments:**
   Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time for 14 segments is:
   \[
   14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we can multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"Let's break down the TV watching hours for each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Wednesday: 30 minutes, which is \(0.5\) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours for a 30-minute episode, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes, so \(2\) hours.

Now, let's sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 6 \text{ hours}\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. The difference between the total hours watched and the hours calculated from the given information is the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday:
\[7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour}\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[1 \div 0.5 = 2\]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 2."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is \( 2x = x + 15 \).

From the equation \( 2x = x + 15 \), we can solve for \( x \):
\[
2x - x = 15 \implies x = 15
\]
So, Henry meant to bake 15 cookies. But he actually baked \( 2x = 2 \times 15 = 30 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is:
\[
30 - 5 = 25
\]
Now, we know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies he had before dropping any is:
\[
110 + 5 = 115
\]
This means that the number of cookies he had before dropping any (which is 25) plus the 5 cookies he dropped equals 115. This confirms our calculation. The number of cookies Henry baked last year, which is the number he meant to bake, is:
\[
\boxed{15}

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore. Since her speed is \(\frac{5}{4}\) feet per second, the time to row 64 seconds (which is 64 feet) is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{\frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second}} = 64 \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{256}{5} = 51.2 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Since Julia rows 64 feet, we can calculate the amount of water taken on as follows:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 6.4 \times 2 = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of vehicles initially counted by the customs officer.
2. Calculate the difference between the total number of vehicles after the second day and the initial number of vehicles.
3. Determine the number of containers imported on the second day based on the number of vehicles per container.

Initially, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these patient hours. The hospital charges $200 per hour:

\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost incurred by the hospital for these patient hours. The doctors charge $150 per hour:

\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost:

\[ 40,000 \text{ dollars} - 30,000 \text{ dollars} = 10,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of them quit after children vomit on them, which means \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) elves quit. So, the number of elves remaining is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the number of elves left is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

The final numerical answer is 30."

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday are:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. Therefore, the miles walked on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday through Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday through Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:

Therefore, the total amount Tom pays in a year for car washes is $720."
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Initially, Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags of chips} \times \$1.50 \text{ per bag} = \$3.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies} \times \$1.00 \text{ per cookie} = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. To find the delivery fee, we calculate 20% of the subtotal:
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total:
\[ \$24.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:

"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed on each test.

For the first test:
- Mark took 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the first test is \(8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- Mark took 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the second test is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).

Now, let's calculate the number of questions he left incomplete for each test.

For the first test:

- He completed 40 questions.
- Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- The test had 100 questions.
- He completed 30 questions.
- Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions}\).

Finally, to find the total number of questions he left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know the total number of cars is 20, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. The rest are semi-automatic.

The number of semi-automatic cars is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Number of automatic cars} - \text{Number of manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost of nonfood items = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The cost of food items (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) is already given without tax, so we don't need to add tax to these. The total cost of food items is:

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Finally, we add the total cost of food items to the final cost of nonfood items to get the overall total cost:

Overall total cost = $15 (food items) + $16.50 (nonfood items) = $31.50

The final numerical answer is $31.50."

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John harvests 4 times a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \times 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:

"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."

2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 24 = 0.20 \times 24 = 4.80
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.80 = 28.80
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.80.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 28.80 = 0.20 \times 28.80 = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.80 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 34.56 = 0.20 \times 34.56 = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 41.472 = 0.20 \times 41.472 = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 49.7664 = 0.20 \times 49.7664 = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. To generalize this, we can use the formula for compound interest, where the price after \( n \) periods is given by:
\[
P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
\]
where \( P_0 \) is the initial price, \( r \) is the rate of increase per period, and \( n \) is the number of periods.

Here, \( P_0 = 20 \), \( r = 0.20 \), and \( n = 18 \) (since 36 months is 18 periods of 2 months each).

\[
P_{36} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
\]
\[
P_{36} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
\]

Now, we calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

Thus,
\[
P_{36} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
\]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76."
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the information given, one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know that one red car costs $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total value of all the toys in the room. The room contains 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll. The total value of the red cars is:

\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

The total value of the action figures is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

The value of the doll is $15. Adding these values together gives the total value of all the toys:

\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"First, we need to determine the amount of missed income Jackie would incur if she does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. Therefore, the missed income is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of hiring an accountant. The accountant charges $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, the amount of money Jackie will have more if she hires the accountant is:

\[ \$15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

The final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to gather that many eggs.

First, Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan. Therefore, for 15 flans, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to gather the necessary 45 eggs to make 15 Spanish flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:

\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has \(16 + 2 = 18\) dollars.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend days together:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:

- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we sum the legs from all the groups:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\) years.

The final numerical answer is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time for 60 potatoes = 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass. Therefore, the revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade is:

\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula to find the total cost. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The total revenue is \( \$10 \) per gallon. If they made one gallon of lemonade, the profit equation is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10 - C \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = \$10 - \$25 \]
\[ C = -\$15 \]

This negative value indicates that the total cost is actually $15 more than the revenue, which is not possible. This suggests that they made more than one gallon of lemonade. Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( n \). The total revenue from selling \( n \) gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$10 \times n \]

The total cost for \( n \) gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$3 \times n + \$2 \times n = \$5 \times n \]

The profit equation is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10n - \$5n \]
\[ \$25 = \$5n \]
\[ n = \frac{\$25}{\$5} \]
\[ n = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The total cost for 5 gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$5 \times 5 = \$25 \]

The cost for lemons for 5 gallons is:

\[ \text{Cost of Lemons} = \$3 \times 5 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:

\[ \$15 \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's monthly salary is 6000$. 

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary.
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary.
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

3. Total spent on rent and car fuel:
\[ \text{Total spent} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

4. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[ \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

5. Donation to charity: Half of the remaining amount.
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

6. Remaining amount after donation:
\[ \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

7. Expenses for his daughter and wife:
\[ \text{Expenses for daughter} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Expenses for wife} = 700 \]
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

8. Remaining amount after expenses for daughter and wife:
\[ \text{Remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is 350$."
"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
3. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:

\[
\text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46

For the second week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"If the winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes, then the loser must have gotten the remaining \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the loser received as follows:

Votes for the loser = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \)

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the information given:
1. The number of red roses ordered is four times the number of white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. The number of pink calla lilies ordered is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

"To determine the winner and the margin of victory, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

For the first team, each runner completes their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the total times taken by the two teams:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. This is the difference in the probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, expressed as a percentage.

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

\[ \text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{0.25}{0.25} \right) \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%, or 0.02 in decimal form.

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months is:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, add the total interest to the original amount owed to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost:
\[ \text{Cost per bag} = \$20 + \$2 = \$22 \]

The selling price per bag is:
\[ \text{Selling price per bag} = \$30 \]

The total cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = n \times \$22 \]

The total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = n \times \$30 \]

The profit is given as $400, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$400 \]
\[ n \times \$30 - n \times \$22 = \$400 \]
\[ n \times (\$30 - \$22) = \$400 \]
\[ n \times \$8 = \$400 \]
\[ n = \frac{\$400}{\$8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Next, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33:

- Total cost of rides = 2 rides * $33/ride = $66.00.

Now, let's find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets and food to the cost of the rides:

- Total cost = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

- Amount each person paid = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily amount needed for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Daily amount for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much insects the entire flock of ten ducks needs per day. We multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Daily amount for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Account for the 30% of trees that die after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net Increase in Trees Each Year**

Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

**Step 2: Number of Trees After 10 Years**

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees would be:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Trees That Die After 10 Years**

30% of the trees die after 10 years. Therefore, the number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[ 91 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 91 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:** Sue starts with 18 pink flamingos.

2. **On Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos are taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors paint these 6 pink flamingos white and put them back out.
   - Now, there are 6 white flamingos and 12 pink flamingos.

3. **On Sunday morning:**
   - The neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos.
   - The total number of flamingos now is \( 6 \text{ (white)} + 12 \text{ (pink)} + 18 \text{ (new pink)} = 36 \).

4. **At noon on Sunday:**
   - We need to find how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos.
   - There are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
   - The difference is \( 12 - 6 = 6 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 6 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a pen. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of a pen as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$12.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417

"To find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **First month collection**: She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
3. **Second month collection**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
4. **Third month collection**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the cards collected over the three months to find the total number of cards Elaine has now:
\[
20 \text{ (initial)} + 60 \text{ (first month)} + 40 \text{ (second month)} + 200 \text{ (third month)} = 320 \text{ cards}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the amounts from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate his new weekly salary after the raise:
- New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, we calculate his total earnings for the year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- His total earnings from the raise over the year = $2100 \times 52.

Additionally, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000.

Let's calculate the total earnings:
- Total earnings from the raise = $2100 \times 52 = $109,200.
- Total earnings including the one-time reward = $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114,200."

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for the macaroni and cheese dish = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
- Total slices of cheese = slices for sandwiches + slices for omelets + slices for macaroni and cheese
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 27 slices.

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Six Tests}}{6} = 93 \]
\[ \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we can find the score required on the sixth test:
\[ \text{Score on Sixth Test} = \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} - \text{Sum of First Five Tests} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

The final numerical answer is 76."
"First, let's determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates would cost:

\[ \text{Cost of half a dozen plates} = \frac{6000}{2} = 3000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much twenty dozen cups cost. According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 3000 - 1200 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, the cost of one cup is:

\[ \text{Cost of one cup} = \frac{1800}{240} = 7.5 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:

\[ 7.5 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is the sum of the money she already has and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since each pool loses 4 gallons per minute due to the leak, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify this by finding the current amount of water in the big pool:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 - 4 \times 4 = 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons, and the small pool had \( 8 - 4 \times 4 = 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, which is not possible, so we need to recheck the consistency. The correct interpretation is that the big pool had \( 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 \) gallons, which satisfies the condition that 4 minutes ago the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the purchase is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:

"To solve the problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[
   \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
   \]
2. Adrian's age in three years:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age in 3 years} = 63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Zack's age in three years:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age in 3 years} = 42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in 3 years} + \text{Adrian's age in 3 years} + \text{Zack's age in 3 years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we sum the time spent on both puzzles:

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. The total number of flowers he plants is 90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus**: It takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.
2. **Travel by Car**: It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

Now, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, the total travel time will be the sum of the travel times for each leg of the trip.

- Travel by bus: 6 days
- Travel by car: 3 days

Adding these together, the total travel time is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) days.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total number of cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"First, let's determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces on the puzzle.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took home the first batch is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the total registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the total cost before registration fees to get the final amount Mark pays.

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"Initially, there are 36 penguins. One-third of them jump into the ocean to swim, which means \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) penguins go swimming. Another one-third go into the cave to eat their dinner, which also means \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \) penguins go into the cave.

So, the total number of penguins that leave for the ocean and the cave is \( 12 + 12 = 24 \).

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \( 36 - 24 = 12 \).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many cherry tomatoes he eats per week.

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as he does, so she eats:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ tomatoes/day}}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \]
Thus, in a week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Together, Steve and his girlfriend eat:
\[ 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram initially buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we can determine how many new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens he has:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

After making these 5 new pens, Ram will have used up 25 empty pens, and he will have 5 new full pens. Now, he has 5 new full pens, and he can continue the process with these 5 new pens. He can make one more pen from these 5 new pens:

\[ \text{Number of additional new pens} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]

After making this additional pen, he will have 1 new pen, and he will have no empty pens left. Therefore, the total number of pens he has now is the 5 new pens he made plus the 1 new pen he made from the 5 new pens:

\[ \text{Total pens} = 5 + 1 = 6 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

After students have left through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B have left. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can determine how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section.

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books:
- Each book is $0.50 overdue.
- Nancy has 8 books overdue.

So, the total cost for the overdue books is:
\[ 8 \text{ books} \times \$0.50 \text{ per book} = \$4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue:
\[ \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ \$6.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, let's find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, let's find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.

Total number of fruits:
\[ 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then determine the total amount of flour required based on the given ratio.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. Therefore, the amount of flour needed per cookie is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1 \text{ cup}}{6 \text{ cookies}} \]

Now, to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we multiply the number of cookies by the amount of flour per cookie:
\[ 66 \text{ cookies} \times \frac{1 \text{ cup}}{6 \text{ cookies}} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 2 \times \frac{9300}{3} = 2 \times 3100 = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has:

\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of trees Harry has} - \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined:

$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400.

So, the final numerical answer is 400."
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total price of the house including both fees:
\[ \text{Total Price} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee} \]
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total Price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ 51 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum them up.

For the newspaper ads:
Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
Cost per television ad = $75
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs for both types of ads:
Total cost = Total cost for newspaper ads + Total cost for television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."

So, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).

Next, we add the additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.

Now, we can calculate the total number of windows in one house:
- Total windows in one house = windows in bedrooms + additional windows
- Total windows in one house = \(6 \text{ windows} + 4 \text{ windows} = 10 \text{ windows}\).

Since John has 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows in one house by 2:
- Total windows in both houses = \(10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out the change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. The items and their respective costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

The total cost is the sum of these amounts:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

Let's calculate the total cost:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]
\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. The change she should receive is:

\[ \text{Change} = 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. Therefore, the number of stitches used for the two sleeves is:

\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 315 \]"

"First, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines, and Sean has to memorize all of them.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the solo song} = 54
   \]

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the first scene} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
   Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the first scene} = \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the second scene} = 54 + 6 = 60
   \]
   Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the second scene} = \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards after B} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter D on them by subtracting the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Cards with letter D} = 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, calculate the time for the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, calculate the time for the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, sum the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

The final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"If the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20, then in 10 years, their ages will each increase by 10 years. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution.

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding the total spots for the cobras and mambas gives us the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

To find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total spots by 2:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

First, calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

Next, determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:
- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length used by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

Now, calculate the number of sterling silver beads:
- Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
- The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 17 inches.
- Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads is \( \frac{17}{0.25} = 68 \).

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract that from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the remaining number of stars by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we first need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out to find the total number of medals given out.

First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 390 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Susan works for a total of 3 hours (from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.), which is equivalent to 180 minutes. She takes a 30-minute break, so she works for 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Earnings per minute} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \, \text{dollars per minute} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 150 \times 0.5 = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The final numerical answer is 83."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:

- Total pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220
- Total squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the totals:

- Total activities: 220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

The final numerical answer is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.4 kg of rice per day.

\[ \text{Daily consumption per person} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

\[ \text{Total daily consumption for 5 people} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week.

\[ \text{Weekly consumption} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Finally, we determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Therefore, the total number of crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the bids she placed and the bids placed by the other bidders.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 3 times. Each of her bids increases by $50. Therefore, her bids are:
1. First bid: $200
2. Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300

The other 3 bidders each bid once, and since they bid in sequence, their bids are:
1. First bidder: $200
2. Second bidder: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bidder: $250 + $50 = $300

Carmen wins with her third bid of $300. To find out how much she spent, we sum up all her bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 = 750 \]

"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- The total amount is the cost of the miles driven plus the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold 45 books this year.
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is \( 45 \times 2 = 90 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the first two years:**
   - Total books sold in the first year: 90
   - Total books sold in the current year: 45
   - Total books sold in the first two years: \( 90 + 45 = 135 \).

3. **Determine the total number of books sold in the three years:**
   - Total books in the collection: 250
   - Unsold books: 50
   - Total books sold in the three years: \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).

4. **Calculate the number of books sold in the third year:**
   - Total books sold in the three years: 200
   - Books sold in the first two years: 135
   - Books sold in the third year: \( 200 - 135 = 65 \).

5. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is **$900**."
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. To find out how many people he beats, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beats 16 people. To find out how many people he loses to, we subtract the number of people he beats from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $2. Therefore, the savings on two tubs of ice cream would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on four packets of milk would be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

The serum causes an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days. We need to find out how many times these growth periods fit into fifteen days.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Since the growth of arms and legs are independent of each other, the total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
- Total new limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 (cost of one business suit) = $500
$700 more than $500 = $5700
So, the flight ticket costs $5700.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits: $600
Cost of suitcases: $150
Cost of flight ticket: $5700
Total cost: $600 + $150 + $5700 = $6450

Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he has to spend is:

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
- There are 5 people in the family.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, calculate the total weekly egg consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\). Then, six years ago, the population was \(P / 2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 60000\).

5. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \).

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after adding the bought marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the total number of marbles in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys.
3. The classroom has 30 boys.

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people at the party.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 men + the number of women who stayed = 40 people in total.

Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 22 + W = 40 \]
\[ W = 40 - 22 \]
\[ W = 18 \]

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters weaker per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to account for the addition of 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee; it only changes the volume of the liquid. However, the problem does not specify that cream weakens the coffee, so we assume it does not affect the weakening factor.

Thus, the total weakening of the coffee is solely due to the ice cubes, which is 60 milliliters.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded out is 7. Since each new record traded out requires 2 old records to be traded in, the total number of old records traded in is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a 40% increase.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required for a 40% increase as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine the final amount the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.
3. Apply the coupon to the discounted price.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer earns $1 off for every $20 spent. They spent $80, so the rewards earned are:
\[ \text{Rewards} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.**

The customer used their $4 rewards on the current shopping trip. So, the price after applying the rewards is:
\[ \text{Price after rewards} = 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Apply the coupon to the discounted price.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon takes off:
\[ \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final price after applying the coupon is:
\[ \text{Final price} = 39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's find the difference in net pay between the two jobs.

Difference in net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

   - Number of unmanned ruined castles = 50% of 88 = 0.50 * 88 = 44.

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + (6 * $350)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + $2,100
Total cost for Furniture United = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

Total cost for Cozy Homes = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + (9 * $250)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + $2,250
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers.

Cost difference = Total cost for Furniture United - Total cost for Cozy Homes
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."

"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial value of Maria's shares.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year's increase.
3. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year's decrease.

**Step 1: Initial Value of Shares**

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
\[ \text{Initial Value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

**Step 2: Value After the First Year**

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year.
\[ \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$64 = 0.50 \times \$64 = \$32 \]
\[ \text{Value After First Year} = \$64 + \$32 = \$96 \]

**Step 3: Value After the Second Year**

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year.
\[ \text{Decrease} = 25\% \times \$96 = 0.25 \times \$96 = \$24 \]
\[ \text{Value After Second Year} = \$96 - \$24 = \$72 \]

The final value of all Maria's shares is:

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."

Two of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, and one is lost completely. This means that the number of balls Josh can use to juggle on stage remains at 4.

So, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling with on stage is 4."
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the weights of each animal based on the given information:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so a blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so a green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so a yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so a red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself, which weighs 20 pounds. The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, the yellow snake, the red bird, and the container:

\[

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month.
4. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.

First, let's calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson should run each day is:

\[ \text{Total daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month. Since June has 30 days, the total distance is:

\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[ 180000 \text{ meters} \]

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors when they were making them:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos now that they make them:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the height of the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 34 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts:

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for two rides on go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and snacks:

- Total budget: $90
- Total cost for mini-golf and go-karts: $25

Money left for arcade tokens and snacks: $90 - $25 = $65.

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so the remaining money after buying arcade tokens is:

- Money left after arcade tokens: $65 - $5 = $60.

This $60 can be used for snacks and other expenses, but the question specifically asks how many friends she can invite, which we assume means how many people can play mini-golf with her. Since one round of mini-golf costs $5 and she has $60 left, the number of friends she can invite is:

- Number of friends: $60 / $5 = 12.

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's calculate the daily cost of the lollipops Marisa buys. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. Therefore, the cost of the lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the cost of the lollipops per day in dollars is:

\[ 100 \text{ cents} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. Therefore, the amount of money she saves each day is the difference between her daily pocket money and the cost of the lollipops:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

If Marisa saves this amount for 5 days, the total amount saved in her piggy bank is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed as:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = S \]
\[ 25 = S \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[18000 \div 675 = 26.6667\]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 23 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

Let's convert this to a decimal for a more precise answer:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8.857 \text{ hours} \]"
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of fourth-grade boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we know that 4 boys were absent on Friday. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park. Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is \(6 + 12 = 18\).

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find the minimum score she needs on the third test, we subtract the total points she has already scored from the required total:

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers minus 5, which can be expressed as \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which can be expressed as \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters:
\[ C + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - (C + 7) = 50 - 10 = 40. \]

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points. Therefore, the points Erin had before scoring the 14 points are:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20 and an additional 20% for etching. The total cost per picture frame is:

\[ 20 + (20 \times 0.20) = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is:

\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Finally, we sum up all the costs:

\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1200 \]

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

First, let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).

Given that 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

Therefore, the number of functioning pieces is:
\[ N - 0.4N = 0.6N \]

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces.

The cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is:
\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of her 30 sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, she gets 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk from these sheep. From the other half of her sheep, which is also 15 sheep, she gets 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk. Therefore, the total amount of milk she collects every day is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the problem, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked on each day:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, so the number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

She also washes 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment by the number of months.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (R) = 10% per year = 0.10 per year
- Time (T) = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years

First, we calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times R \times T = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

Let's calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.083333 = 304.1667 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount to be repaid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 304.1667 = 3954.1667 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} = \frac{3954.1667}{5} = 790.8333 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 790.83 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 790.83 \]"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has:

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos they have together:

- Axel's total: \(50\) silver pesos + \(80\) gold pesos = \(130\) pesos.
- Anna's total: \(100\) silver pesos + \(120\) gold pesos = \(220\) pesos.

Adding their totals together:

\[130 + 220 = 350\]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make:

- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade.

So, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:

- She sells each cup for $1.
- She has 36 cups.

So, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade:

- She spent $18 to buy the supplies.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

Therefore, the profit per hour that Millie makes running the lemonade stand is:
\[ \$4.50 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{5} L = 12.8
\]

To find \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[
L = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can convert 12.8 to a fraction:
\[
12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5}
\]

Now, multiply:
\[
L = \frac{64}{5} \times 2.5 = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26. Therefore, the total number of female members in the choir is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = \text{Number of girls} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. However, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. So, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who can make it to the show is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can make it} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = \text{Number of female members who can make it} + \text{Number of teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we sum up all the test scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400. Now, we need to divide this sum by the number of tests, which is 5, to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
12 inches"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services Tim will use after the discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount, the cost for each is reduced by 20% of $10.

The discount for Hulu and Disney Plus is:
\[ 10 \times 0.20 = 2 \]

So, the discounted monthly cost for each of Hulu and Disney Plus is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount:
\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Next, we add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus to find the total monthly cost for the streaming services:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \]

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to the streaming services is:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends half that much time recording it, which is:
\[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all activities:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 120 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 90 \text{ minutes (editing)} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is:

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption after the reduction.
3. Calculate the total energy saved in 30 days.

First, the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Reducing the usage by 5 hours a day means the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

The daily energy consumption after the reduction is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
\[ 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} = 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \]

Now, to find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, initially, Allan has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more. Since he now has 100 cannolis, he bought \(100 - 40 = 60\) fewer corns. Therefore, the new total of corns is \(80 - 60 = 20\).

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:
\[ 100 \text{ (cannolis)} + 20 \text{ (corns)} = 120 \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{120}\)."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + 4 * $0.25 = $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells and magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she contributes 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( C \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

To find the number of camels, we substitute \( D = 56 \) back into the equation \( C = 180 - D \):
\[ C = 180 - 56 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

To verify, we check the total number of humps:
\[ 2C + D = 2(124) + 56 = 248 + 56 = 304 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

   - Total distance for the second week = 7 days * 300 km/day = 2100 km.

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- Total distance = Distance for the first 4 days + Distance for the next 2 days + Distance for the next day + Distance for the second week
- Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's locker.

1. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, then Zack's locker is:
\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. If Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, then Timothy's locker is:
\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet (where Stanley was standing initially) and then it fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. Therefore, the comb is at an elevation of:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb at 6,000 feet, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Sum the amounts given by both banks.
3. Add the total amount received from the banks to the initial capital.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we sum the amounts given by both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add this total to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ 17000 \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats left is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the payments into segments based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 18 months (months 9 to 26)**: The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   \[
   18 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$252
   \]

Now, we sum up all the payments to find the total cost for 2 years:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$252 = \$324
\]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is **\$324**."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the original cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each, while her bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

To find the total number of birds she can expect to see each day, we multiply the number of feeders by the number of birds each feeder attracts:

\[ 6 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 180 \text{ birds per day} \]

The final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so the cost of the soup is:

\[ \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 0.25 \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so the cost of the cake is:

\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after spending $50 on the ticket, he has $50 left. This means the total amount of money he earned from selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the ticket plus the $50 he has left).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 100 cards."
"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. Since half of the 40 guests would have two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} \times 2 = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

The caterer prepared 40 hotdogs, but 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer needs to provide 40 more hotdogs to satisfy the second hotdog request for each of the 40 guests. However, the caterer only has 40 hotdogs, so he can only provide one hotdog to each guest.

Since there are 40 guests and the caterer can only provide one hotdog per guest, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 - 40 = 0
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost (100% - 20% = 80%).

To find 80% of $165.00, we calculate:
$165.00 * 0.80 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."

"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, and Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Next, let's find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Finally, let's determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

So, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is 30."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. We know he got 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, we can calculate how much money he had left:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} \times 0.01 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

This means the amount of money George spent on chips and candy bars is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 5 \text{ cents} = 495 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we know the cost of the chips is 120 cents, so the amount of money spent on candy bars is:
\[ 495 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \frac{375 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

"First, we need to find the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater and then find the difference between Bernadette's and Wayne's arrival times.

First, we know that it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's 4-minute drive time. Thus, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]

However, since Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to consider the absolute time difference:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]
This means Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne's 4-minute drive time to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} + 1 \text{ minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne's 4-minute drive time to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. This means Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne's 4-minute drive time, which is 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can use the area formula to find the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.

\[ \text{Temperature increase from oven} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

\[ \text{Temperature decrease from window} = \left(\frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\right) \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, let's add the temperature increase from the oven and subtract the temperature decrease from the window from the initial temperature.

\[ \text{Initial temperature} = 40 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ \text{Final temperature} = 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's total time: 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.
- James' swim time: Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, and he finishes 10% faster, so James' swim time is \(40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36\) minutes.
- James' bike time: Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, and he takes 5 minutes longer, so James' bike time is \(80 + 5 = 85\) minutes.
- James' run time: We need to find this, but we know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

Now, we can set up the equation for James' total time:
\[ \text{James' total time} = \text{James' swim time} + \text{James' bike time} + \text{James' run time} \]
\[ 160 = 36 + 85 + \text{James' run time} \]
\[ 160 = 121 + \text{James' run time} \]
\[ \text{James' run time} = 160 - 121 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \text{James' run time} = 39 \text{ minutes} \]"

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B in minutes is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can calculate the length of Movie A as follows:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of one popcorn with a soda with the super ticket is $21 (since the popcorn and soda cost $1 extra).

The cost of a movie ticket is $12, and the cost of one popcorn and one soda without the super ticket is \( P + 3 \).

Given that you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 20 - (P + 3) = 12 + (P + 3) - 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 20 - P - 3 = 12 + P + 3 - 2 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[ \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new cost per balloon:
\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = 170 \times 60 + 170 \times 5 = 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment at 60 mph for 2 hours: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment at 30 mph for 1 hour: \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

Finally, calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\).

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna traded. Jenna traded 3 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. Therefore, the value of the sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

Next, we need to determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she had 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Now, we calculate the total value of the sapphires Jenna has left:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Jenna also received 2 rubies in the trade. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the rubies she received is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires she has left to the value of the rubies she received:

\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \$6400 \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in that period and then sum those amounts.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to the 15 red cards.

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

The final numerical answer is 78."

"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's sum up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings from aluminum cans + Weekly earnings from plastic bottles
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

Finally, let's calculate her total earnings for a four-week month:
- Total earnings for four weeks = Total weekly earnings * 4 weeks
- Total earnings for four weeks = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

Thus, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day:**
   Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day.
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day:**
   Since there are four horses:
   \[
   10 \text{ pounds/day/horse} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses for five days:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Razors Before Discount:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 packs is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Discount:**
   - The discount is ""buy one get one free,"" so for every 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Since she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - The cost for 1 pack is $4.00.

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost becomes \(4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost in Cents:**
   - Since $2.00 is equivalent to 200 cents.

5. **Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Therefore, 2 packs contain \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.
   - The cost per razor is \(\frac{200 \text{ cents}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 25 \text{ cents per razor}\).

The final numerical answer in cents is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The human pyramid is structured as follows:

- 4 girls on the bottom layer
- 3 girls on the second layer
- 2 girls on the third layer
- 1 girl on the top layer

First, we calculate the total height of the pyramid by summing the heights of all the cheerleaders:

\[ \text{Total height} = (4 \times 64) + (3 \times 64) + (2 \times 64) + (1 \times 60) \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \]
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \]
\[ 1 \times 60 = 60 \]

Now, sum these values:

\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \]

The total height of the human pyramid is 636 inches. To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."

   - If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, her current age is \( 42 - 4 = 38 \).

Thus, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's determine the number of rides he made in one day:
- Morning ride: 1
- Afternoon ride: 1

So, in one day, he made a total of 2 rides.

Next, we calculate the total number of rides he made in 14 days:
- Total rides in 14 days = 14 days * 2 rides/day = 28 rides

Now, we calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Cost per morning ride: $6
- Total cost for morning rides = 28 rides * $6/ride = $168

Next, we calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Cost per afternoon ride: $2
- Total cost for afternoon rides = 28 rides * $2/ride = $56

Finally, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Cost of food per guest: $5 (already included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two cost equations equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \):

\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16."

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass and then compare it to the cost of the bus pass.

First, let's calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Janet takes two bus trips each day.
- She takes five bus trips per day.
- Therefore, her total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
- Each bus trip costs her $2.20.
- Thus, her total weekly cost without the bus pass is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Now, we calculate the savings by subtracting the cost of the bus pass from her total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Savings = Total weekly cost without the bus pass - Cost of the bus pass
- Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

- Mittens: 3 pairs of mittens
- Socks: 3 pairs of socks

Next, we calculate the number of skeins required for each item:

- Hats: 3 hats * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 pairs of mittens * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 pairs of socks * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, we sum up the total number of skeins needed:

6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completes on each day.

On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.

Now, let's calculate the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday:
\[12 \text{ (Monday)} + 36 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 48 \text{ problems}\]

Next, we need to find out how many problems are left after Tuesday:
\[100 \text{ (total problems)} - 48 \text{ (problems completed)} = 52 \text{ problems}\]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \text{ problems}\]

Now, let's find out how many problems are left after Wednesday:
\[52 \text{ (problems remaining after Tuesday)} - 13 \text{ (problems completed on Wednesday)} = 39 \text{ problems}\]

Therefore, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

The final numerical answer is 29."

2. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning: 200 - 93 = 107 loaves.
3. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon: 107 - 39 = 68 loaves.
4. Add the number of loaves returned by the grocery store: 68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is 74."
"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row, we divide the total number of red tulips by 6:

\[ \text{Number of rows of red tulips} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

Next, we calculate how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, we divide the total number of blue tulips by 8:

\[ \text{Number of rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \]

To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips:

\[ \text{Total number of rows} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to find out how many cups of raisins she will have for the oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag equally among the three items.

The total number of cups of raisins is 27. If she divides the raisins equally among the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix), each item will get:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups of raisins} \]

Since each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a cup of raisins, the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make is:

\[ \frac{9}{\frac{3}{4}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption and cost before adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Daily cost: \( 12 \times 1.50 = 18 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the daily consumption and cost after adding the new device:
- New daily consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour
- Daily cost: \( 14 \times 1.50 = 21 \) dollars

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost before and after adding the new device:
- Weekly cost before: \( 18 \times 7 = 126 \) dollars
- Weekly cost after: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) dollars

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly costs:
- Difference: \( 147 - 126 = 21 \) dollars

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the people can paint and then scale it up to 5 people.

First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day. Therefore, in one day, 5 people can paint:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house}
\]

So, 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, it would take them:

\[
2 \text{ days}
\]

Now, we need to convert these days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is:

\[
2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house. The final numerical answer is:

\[
48

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as previously calculated).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: 20 sofas + 22 chairs = 42
- Jenna's total: 64 sofas + 66 chairs = 130

Adding their totals together:

\[ 42 + 130 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is 172."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
2. Determine the amount of money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

With $4, we can determine how many CDs he could have bought. Since each CD costs $4, he could buy:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, including the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional hours he spent:
- He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, which adds:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]
- He spent 6 hours in one week, which adds:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add these additional hours to the initial total:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 people get off. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[48 - 8 + 40 = 80\]

At the second stop, 21 people get off. Then, 3 times fewer people get on compared to those who got off. So, \(21 / 3 = 7\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[80 - 21 + 7 = 66\]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then Jame's cousin's current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 57 years old.
   - The age difference between them is \( 57 - 22 = 35 \) years.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls.

First, since there are twenty kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies. Therefore, the final answer is 16."
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal.

Vlogs made so far: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Vlogs needed to reach the goal: 72 (monthly goal) - 54 (vlogs made so far) = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her monthly goal."

\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) dollars.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share.
   - His new share is \(6 + 5 = 11\) dollars.
   - The following day, he adds another $10.
   - His total amount after these additions is \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.

3. **Spending:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8.
   - His amount after spending is \(21 - 8 = 13\) dollars.

4. **Saving and Tripling:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8.
   - The amount he has left after spending is $13.
   - Tripling this amount gives \(13 \times 3 = 39\) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount the eldest boy has is $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. First, we need to determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in April, which is $1125. Since April has 30 days, we can divide this amount by the number of days in April to find out how much he needs to save each day on average.

\[ \text{Average daily savings} = \frac{1125}{30} = 37.5 \]

This means Elvis needs to save $37.50 each day on average to meet his target. However, he wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. Let's denote the amount he saves in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the amount he saves in the second half of the month will be \( 2x \).

The total amount saved in April is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:

\[ x + 2x = 3x \]

We know that the total amount saved in April is $1125, so:

\[ 3x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{1125}{3} = 375 \]

So, Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month. For the second half, he saves twice this amount:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 375 = 750 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $750 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 750 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out the change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final numerical answer is $7.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\[ 130 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( J \).

James's play set has 80 toys. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the number of toys Jonathan needs is \( 5 \times 80 = 400 \).

This means that Jonathan's current number of toys \( J \) plus 2 equals 400. We can set up the equation:
\[ J + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( J \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ J = 400 - 2 \]
\[ J = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, the commission is 30%.
2. For the amount over $1000 (which is $1500 in this case), the commission is an additional 10% on top of the 30% already earned.

Let's calculate the commission for each part:

- Commission on the first $1000: \(1000 \times 0.30 = 300\)
- Commission on the amount over $1000: \(1500 \times 0.30 = 450\)
- Additional commission on the amount over $1000: \(450 \times 0.10 = 45\)

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we subtract the time taken in cold water from the time taken in warm water:
- The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We can find this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, let's determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40, and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, to find the total cost for both subs, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate the volume of Zack's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]

Substituting the volume of Zack's locker into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction in cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

To find the specific numerical value, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee and the problem does not provide a specific value for \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

Therefore, the reduction in cups of coffee that Juan must make is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the problem does not provide a specific value for \( R \), the final answer in terms of \( R \) is:
\[ \boxed{5R - 4} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of friends (which is 3):
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground after moving for 10 hours.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle the sun has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]"
"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs in total.

1. Determine the ages of the sons:
   - The older son is 12 years old.
   - The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

2. Calculate the total number of candles needed:
   - James needs one candle for each son, so he needs \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles.

3. Determine how many packs of candles are needed:
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) packs.

4. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each pack costs $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we first find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval, the total number of pages read in the first week is:
\[ 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we know that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( S + 7 \) years old.
3. In 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.
4. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Now, substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. **First Operation**: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.
   - Half of the starting value is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - Adding this to the starting value gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - Dividing this result by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.
   - The starting value minus 12 is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   - Multiplying the result from the first operation by this value gives \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that same percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% off percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe. To find the actual temperature that would be set to achieve 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature \( T \) such that:
\[ 520 \times (1 + 0.04) = T \]
\[ 520 \times 1.04 = T \]
\[ T = 540.8 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 540.8 degrees to achieve the desired 520 degrees for her recipe.

"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial purchase of 24 dishes. Therefore, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12 + 28 = 40\) cups.
Judy's total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\) dishes.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both is:

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount. The original price of one box is $100.00. A 10% discount on $100.00 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount} = 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ \text{Total Contacts} = 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ \text{Hours John worked on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Hours John worked on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total hours John worked:
\[ \text{Total hours John worked} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John.

Jill's earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings for Jill} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = 3 \times 10 = \$30 \]

John's earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings for John} = 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = 7 \times 10 = \$70 \]

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the typing speed for the third test. The initial speed is 47 WPM, and after the first increase, it becomes 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed by 5 words per minute, the third test speed will be:

\[ 52 \text{ WPM} + 5 \text{ WPM} = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we have the three typing speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these values and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Now, divide the sum by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than Mark's window that is 20 feet off the ground.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Protein per 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake per week. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the weekly protein intake is:
\[ \text{Weekly protein intake} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the additional cost for the porcelain crown is:
\[ 500 \]

The total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees, the second angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees, and the third angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's sum up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

The final numerical answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum the total number of legs from all the pets:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined total amount of chocolates made by both in 12 hours:

"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade over the 6 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Total cups sold in four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
- Total earnings from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Total cups sold in two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
- Total earnings from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Adding the earnings from both periods:

"First, let's determine the total number of rotations the tires make in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this value:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months per tire by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tires can last for 6 years before they need to be replaced. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much each pump costs, we need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one pump and then calculate the cost per pump.

The directions state that 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, 1 pump gives:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. To find the cost per pump in dollars, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

To convert the cost per pump from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents per pump} \]

Thus, the cost of each pump is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35, and there is a 30% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on shorts} = 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shorts} = 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. To find out how much money he will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost of the outfit from $50:
\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, Joe will have $8.00 left after the purchase."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter needed based on the number of dozens.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. A week has 7 days.

So, the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 months funding:**
   - The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended 5 months funding:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it took \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) cost 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - The new monthly funding for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars per month.
   - Therefore, the total funding for the extended 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Adding the initial 5 months funding and the extended 45 months funding, we get:
   \[
   100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell the 750 kg of meat from the bull:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium.
2. Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators.
3. Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated.
4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.
5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total number of seats in the auditorium is given by the number of rows multiplied by the number of seats per row:
   \[
   \text{Total seats} = 4 \times 18 = 72
   \]

2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18
   \]

3. The number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54
   \]

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18
   \]

5. The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have been seated:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by students} = 54 - 18 = 36
   \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights available.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles/intersection} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:
\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

Given that 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 76 \]"

"First, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s).

Given:
- Ashley's internet connection speed = 20 kb/s
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000:
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:
\[ 72 \text{ Mb/hour} \]"
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave. Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright. To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.

1. **Price of a diamond jewel**: Given as $2000.
2. **Price of a gold jewel**: The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]
3. **Price of a silver jewel**: The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

Now, we sum the prices of all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
\]
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob, given their respective speeds.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is closing the gap at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is reducing the 75-mile gap by 15 miles every hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the entire 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is \( \frac{60}{n} \). We need to find the maximum \( n \) such that \( \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \).

Solving the inequality:
\[
\frac{60}{n} \leq 10
\]
Multiply both sides by \( n \):
\[
60 \leq 10n
\]
Divide both sides by 10:
\[
6 \leq n
\]
So, \( n \) must be at least 6. This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
4

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} + \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1050 \]"

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = \text{Reggie's distance} - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of four apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of three oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's sum up the costs of these features:

Total cost of additional features = $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $13,500

Finally, we add the base price of the truck to the total cost of the additional features:

Next, we need to find out how many likes she received recently. According to the problem, she received 20000 more likes recently. So, we add these 20000 likes to the 140000 likes she had three weeks after posting:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

Thus, the total number of likes on the photo is:

\[ 160000 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 160000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 voucher, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales in two months:**
   - Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales in two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
2100"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - This is a total of 4 hours (9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours).

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Therefore, he pays for 3 hours (4 hours total - 1 free hour).

3. **Calculate the cost for the paid hours:**
   - The first hour is $15.
   - Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous hour.
   - The cost for the first hour is $15.
   - The cost for the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30.
   - The cost for the third hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - First hour: $15
   - Second hour: $30
   - Third hour: $60
   - Total cost: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105 for the carriage service."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to calculate the difference between the amount in her bank account at the end of the week and the amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage.

The amount in her bank account at the end of the week is $420.
The amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage of $300 is $300.

The difference, which represents the amount withheld, is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \text{Amount in bank account at the end of the week} - \text{Amount she should have} \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 420 - 300 \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 120 \]

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is $120."
"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since each deviled egg consists of 2 halves, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs this is. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required to read the book is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total days required from the deadline:
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the initial cost of the plane and the monthly costs for renting a hanger and fuel, then sum these up for a full year.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Costs:**
   - James pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger.
   - He spends twice as much on fuel, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 a month.

3. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Total monthly cost = Cost of renting a hanger + Cost of fuel
   - Total monthly cost = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

4. **Annual Cost:**
   - Annual cost = Total monthly cost * 12 months
   - Annual cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

5. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   - Total cost = Initial cost of the plane + Annual cost
   - Total cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes to cook pork.
3. The time it took to cook beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes. Therefore, it took her \(80 / 2 = 40\) minutes to cook beans.

Now, to find the total time it took to cook all the food, we add the times for each item:
\[30 \text{ (rice)} + 50 \text{ (pork)} + 40 \text{ (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}\]

"To find the difference in cost between the two mixtures, we first need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

We know that:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. Sheep have 1 head and geese have 1 head.
3. The total number of animal legs is 70.
4. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]
\[ S + G = 20 \]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15. Let's verify this by finding the number of geese:
\[ G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. When 8 more dogs arrive, he needs to buy toys for these 8 dogs. So, he needs 8 toys.

After buying the toys for the 8 new dogs, the number of dogs in the shelter becomes 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. At this point, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 12 dogs, and he needs to buy toys for these 12 dogs. So, he needs 12 toys.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he had to return 3 toys.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we sum up the toys he initially had, the toys he bought for the 8 new dogs, and the additional toys he bought for the 12 dogs, and then subtract the 3 toys he returned:

\[ 4 \text{ (initial toys)} + 8 \text{ (toys for 8 new dogs)} + 12 \text{ (toys for 12 dogs)} - 3 \text{ (returned toys)} = 21 \]

"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

From the information, we can express the number of cookies each person has in terms of \( C \):
- Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.
- Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
- Summer has \( (C + 12) + 23 = C + 35 \) cookies.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
\[ C + 7 = 68 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 68 - 7 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Now we can find the number of cookies each person has:
- The Cookie Monster has \( C = 61 \) cookies.
- Max has \( C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \) cookies.
- Katarina has 68 cookies (as given).
- Summer has \( C + 35 = 61 + 35 = 96 \) cookies.

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. Since the question asks for the time in minutes, we'll use minutes for both modes.

- ""Turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of his lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time spent mowing the entire lawn, we add the time spent in both modes:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we first need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking.

They have spent:
- 6 minutes to get to the corner with the library.
- 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

Adding these times together:
\[ 6 + 13 = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

They have a total of 30 minutes to get to school. To find out how much longer they have, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time:
\[ 30 - 19 = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late."

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:

Total available time before dinner - Total homework time = Available time for nap
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of the lollipops and candies Manolo bought.

Given:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

The cost of the candies is $1.20. Since each candy costs the same as a lollipop ($0.40), we can determine the number of candies Manolo bought:
\[ \frac{\$1.20}{\$0.40 \text{ per candy}} = 3 \text{ candies} \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
- The cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

- The cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.40 \text{ per candy} = \$4.00 \]

Add the costs of the 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \$8.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over a period of ten years.

First, let's calculate the number of coins Rong has saved in ten years:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.
- Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved in ten years is \(20 \times 120 = 2400\) coins.

Next, let's calculate the number of coins Neil has saved in ten years:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.
- In ten years, Neil saves \(28 \times 120 = 3360\) coins.

Finally, to find the total number of coins they have together after ten years, we add the coins saved by Rong and Neil:
- Total coins = Coins saved by Rong + Coins saved by Neil = \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.6T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine the price of each type of fruit:

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges:

- The cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Adding these costs together gives the total price for one crate of fruit:

\[
5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = $32.0
\]

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32.0."

Now, let's find the total number of squares on the comforter:

Total squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares
Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total squares = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final numerical answer is:
68"
"First, let's determine the total number of chairs needed for the function. We know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs Mia currently has. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, the total number of chairs Mia currently has is:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs she currently has from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is 5."
"First, let's determine the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points are:
   \[

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she has $1200 left after putting money into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she has $2400 - $1200 (retirement) - $480 (car payment) left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person gets one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the cost for each person:

- Cost of drinks per person: \(2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per drink} = \$4\)
- Cost of snacks per person: \(3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2 \text{ per snack} = \$6\)

So, the total cost per person for drinks and snacks is:

\[ \$4 + \$6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the goal of $6300, given that $2100 has already been raised in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:

"First, we need to determine how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of those who receive interviews receive a job offer. Since 20% of the interviewees receive a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

Now, we need to determine how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position. Since a third of the job offers are accepted, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Goldy gave a total of 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, which sums up to 3 + 4 = 7 sacks. Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, the total kilograms of rice she gave to her cousin and brother is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms. 

The final numerical answer is 175."
"This week, Castle bought a total of 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, which sums up to 3 + 5 = 8 boxes. Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot tap rate: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 250 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

For 3 minutes (since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, she dances with her arms at her sides for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes):
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute

For 2 minutes:
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both parts of the dance:
\[ 1650 \text{ taps} + 800 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps} \]

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself. 

The cost of fixing the pothole is $450.
The cost of the asphalt is 3 buckets at $25 each, which totals to \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

So, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole is \(450 + 75 = 525\) dollars.

The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.

Therefore, the net cost for Ron to fix the pothole is \(525 - 120 = 405\) dollars.

If the pothole is not fixed, the damage to his car will be $450.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is the difference between the damage to his car and the net cost of fixing the pothole, which is \(450 - 405 = 45\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair:
170 normal chairs - 20 repaired chairs = 150 normal chairs left.

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left after some were sent for repair:
23 baby chairs - 13 repaired chairs = 10 baby chairs left.

Now, let's add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left:
150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs.

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five friends:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices ordered to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog can eat the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages is:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Now, let's determine how many windows Hannah smashes:
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows}
  \]
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows:
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows}
  \]

Finally, let's add the number of windows smashed by students' cars and teachers' cars:
\[
64 + 48 = 112
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is \(\boxed{112}\)."
"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the percentage of her spools that are blue is:
\[ 40\% \]"
"At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote. By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.

First, calculate the number of people who voted by midday:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by midday is:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people after midday were 3000, so 2/3 of 3000 voted by 16:00:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1000 \]"
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the total number of pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Pieces per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- There are 9 kids, and each wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- There are 6 adults, and each will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to determine how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes the base for 8 smores, we need to find out how many sleeves are required for 24 smores:

\[ \text{Number of sleeves needed} = \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, they will need:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Dora's father and mother based on the given information and then find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, let's find Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:
\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:
\[
\boxed{87}

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight for these books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of these two books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the weight of her history book is:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 7 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:
\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, and candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B's votes:
\[ 50\% \text{ more than candidate A's votes} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes.

Total votes:
\[ 100 \]

Votes for candidate C:
\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

- For the medium cubes: 7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
- For the small cubes: 8 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used:

Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

So, the final numerical answer is 2 ounces."
"If Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven, then Steven has half the number of books Clara has. Therefore, Steven has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students = 50
- Number of students who like to bake = 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
- The rest like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

According to the problem, \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

The total number of students can be represented as the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music:

\[ 10 + 5 + V + M = 50 \]

Substituting \( M = 10 \) into the equation:

\[ 10 + 5 + V + 10 = 50 \]

Simplifying the equation:

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sean's Marbles**: We are given that Sean has 56 marbles.
2. **Cal's Marbles**: Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, if Sean has 56 marbles, Cal has \( 56 \times 2 = 112 \) marbles.
3. **Carl's Marbles**: Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, Carl has \( 56 \times 4 = 224 \) marbles.

Now, to find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have:

- Carl has 224 marbles.
- Cal has 112 marbles.

Adding these together: \( 224 + 112 = 336 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 336."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

First, we find out how many students would be in each group if there are 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group} \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking for the number of additional groups needed to form, but since the division is not possible, we conclude that no additional groups are needed to form a whole number of students per group.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form a whole number of students per group, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can divide 54 students into equal groups. The smallest number of groups that can do this is 6 (as given in the problem), and the next possible number of groups would be 12, which we have already calculated as not possible.

Thus, the number of additional groups needed to form a whole number of students per group is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the weekly rental numbers and then extend that to the two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the weekly rental for weekdays and weekends:
- Weekdays: 5 days a week, 60 chairs rented each day.
- Weekends: 2 days a week, 100 chairs rented each day.

For a single week:
- Weekday rental: \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.
- Weekend rental: \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.
- Total weekly rental: \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.

Now, for two 4-week months:
- Total weeks in two 4-week months: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weeks.
- Total rental in 8 weeks: \(8 \times 500 = 4000\) chairs.

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses sent is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates sent is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we need to account for the broken items. 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, the number of glasses and plates that are not broken are:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

Adding the non-broken glasses and plates together, we get:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

So, the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is:
\[ \boxed{128} \]"
"First, let's determine how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 small buttons.

Next, let's calculate how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, and a large button is worth three small buttons, each large sticker is worth 1 large button. Therefore, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

Now, let's determine how many large stickers she has left after trading 20 for large buttons. She started with 40 large stickers and traded 20, so she has:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 1 large button, and a large button is worth three small buttons, each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons. Therefore, trading 20 large stickers for small buttons gives her:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has by the end. She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, the 20 large buttons are equivalent to:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

So, the total number of buttons she has is:

\[ 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day of the week.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches played each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 7."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts ordered:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 133 \]"
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs across all playlists.
2. Calculate the total number of hours by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song.

First, let's calculate the total number of songs:
- Each playlist has 300 songs.
- John has 20 playlists.

Total number of songs = 300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs.

Next, we calculate the total number of hours:
- Each song is 10 hours long.

Total number of hours = 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours.

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This leaves:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
people who do not think horse #2 will win.

Next, we calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win. 

60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. This leaves:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]
people who do not think horse #7 will win.

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16."
"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

We know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranian puppies is:

\[ \text{Total Pomeranian puppies} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of puppies (let's call this number \( P \)):

\[ \frac{2}{3} P = 18 \]

To solve for \( P \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{3}{2} \):

\[ P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90, so half of that is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Jayden initially had $70, and his sister gave him $45, so now Jayden has:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so the amount of money Jayden still needs to buy the camera is:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"

"To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to determine how many pears he has. Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and the time he spends driving back home.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and at the same speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours.

Next, we add the time spent at the museum, which is 6 hours, to the time spent driving to and from the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time at museum} + \text{Time back home} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older, which is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies:

- The cost for the series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost for the remaining movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the remaining movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:
\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance driven and the total distance hiked, and then sum these distances to find the total distance to the vacation spot.

First, let's calculate the distance driven:
- They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked:
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour, and 5 miles per hour less than this is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we sum the distances driven and hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
- Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. Emma's score is calculated as \( 10E_e + 5B_e \). Ava's score is calculated as \( 10E_a + 5B_a + 30 \times 4 \).

Substituting the values for Ava's score:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_e + 5B_e + 215 \]

Emma's score is:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E_e + 5B_e \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5B_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is 215."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. The cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost gives us the cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. **Normal Days (3 days):** Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day.
   - Number of rides per normal day = 3
   - Number of normal days = 3
   - Total rides on normal days = 3 rides/day * 3 days = 9 rides

2. **Special Days (2 days):** They ride twice the times they do on normal days.
   - Number of rides per special day = 3 * 2 = 6 rides
   - Number of special days = 2
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

3. **Total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = rides on normal days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 9 rides + 12 rides = 21 rides

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 21."
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we can eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles per day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in a week is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) miles.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed for 50 miles is \(50 \div 10 = 5\) gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost for 5 gallons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means she received:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money spent for lunch is the sum of the money spent on quarters and the money spent on twenties:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
142

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales = 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The temperature during the night is 12 degrees, which is below the freezing point of 32 degrees. To find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees, we calculate the difference:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to determine how many logs are required to raise the temperature by 20 degrees. We do this by dividing the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jeans.
2. Subtract the discounted price from the $50.00 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price is $40.00, and the jeans are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 25% (or 0.25):

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, subtract the discounted price from $50.00:

\[ \text{Money left over} = 50.00 - 30.00 = 20.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20.00 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Adding these to the initial 200 employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to 260 employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Initial Hourly Wage:**
   - Billy's initial hourly wage was $10 per hour.

2. **After 2 months:**
   - Billy received a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - New hourly wage = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

3. **On his first anniversary:**
   - Billy received another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - New hourly wage = $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours at each of these hourly rates:

1. **Initial Hourly Wage ($10 per hour):**
   - Total earnings = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200.

2. **After 2 months ($10.50 per hour):**
   - Total earnings = $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.

3. **On his first anniversary ($11.50 per hour):**
   - Total earnings = $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230.

Next, we calculate Sally's hourly wage. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary:

- Sally's starting hourly wage = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, we calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:

- Total earnings = $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.

Finally, we find the difference in their total earnings:

- Difference = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings
- Difference = $230 - $210 = $20.

Thus, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally in 20 hours. The final numerical answer is:

\[

\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ 428 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ \text{Total number of teachers} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, and each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by students} = 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

The total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by teachers} = 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by students and teachers together gives the total number of trees planted:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has and then calculate how many stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \), and the total number of stuffed goats will be \( x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of all her stuffed animals.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. Therefore, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total hours played in the next week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the next week, we get:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}

"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \)

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can make with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area and the height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag contains 72 chips.
- Milo has two bags.
- Therefore, the total number of chips is \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) chips.

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make every square inch.
- Therefore, the total area in square inches is \( \frac{144}{12} = 12 \) square inches.

Now, we know the height of the mosaic is 3 inches. To find the length, we use the area formula for a rectangle (Area = Length × Height):
- The area is 12 square inches.
- The height is 3 inches.
- Therefore, the length is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) inches.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since he made this amount of money during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days in the week:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."

They play for a total of 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. The total play time of 70 minutes is less than the total available time of 240 minutes, so we need to determine how many quarters are used.

Since each quarter allows for 20 minutes of play, we can calculate the number of quarters used by dividing the total play time by 20:
240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:
12 quarters * $0.25 per quarter = $3.00

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

The cost of the cows is:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

So, the final numerical answer is 4500."

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time in hours for both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:
\[ 720 \]

Let's confirm this with a final answer in a separate line:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total number of cars:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   
   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle}
   \]
   
   Now, the daily earnings are:
   \[
   30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00/\text{cycle} = \$180.00/\text{day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.
   
   Therefore, the weekly earnings are:
   \[
   \$180.00/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$1260.00/\text{week}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 153 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3\)

Let's calculate the total:
```python
# Number of each color of eggs
green_eggs = 5
blue_eggs = 2 * green_eggs
pink_eggs = blue_eggs - 1
yellow_eggs = pink_eggs // 3

# Total number of eggs

"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time spent on all activities:
\[ 288 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} + 360 \text{ minutes} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items she needs installed. The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.

First, let's calculate the number of additional items Angela needs:
- Additional mirrors: \(6 - 4 = 2\)
- Additional chandeliers: \(2 - 1 = 1\)
- Additional pictures: \(20 - 10 = 10\)

So, Angela needs 2 additional mirrors, 1 additional chandelier, and 10 additional pictures.

The cost for each additional item is $15.00. Therefore, the total cost for the additional items is:
\[2 \text{ (mirrors)} \times \$15.00 + 1 \text{ (chandelier)} \times \$15.00 + 10 \text{ (pictures)} \times \$15.00\]
\[= 2 \times 15 + 1 \times 15 + 10 \times 15\]
\[= 30 + 15 + 150\]
\[= 205\]

The initial installation cost is $129.00. Adding the cost of the additional items, the total cost for Angela is:
\[129 + 205 = 334\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the number of kangaroos, their speed, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway. We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.

Let's denote:
- The speed of one kangaroo as \( v \).
- The time taken by 3 kangaroos to cross the highway as \( t = 18 \) hours.

The distance \( D \) across the highway can be calculated using the formula:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]
For 3 kangaroos:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Let \( t' \) be the time it takes for 4 turtles to cross the highway. The distance \( D \) can also be expressed as:
\[ D = 4 \left( \frac{v}{2} \right) t' \]
\[ D = 2v t' \]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same for both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
\[ 3v \times 18 = 2v t' \]

We can cancel \( v \) from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 t' \]
\[ 54 = 2 t' \]
\[ t' = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ t' = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to cross the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"

To find the total number of dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140 dishes.

The final numerical answer is 140."
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received money from three sources: her part-time job, her mom, and her savings in her purse. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money she has is the sum of her part-time job earnings, her mom's contribution, and her savings:

\[ 150 + 80 + x = 350 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 230 + x = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from the large apples and the small apples to find the total number of slices Adam has:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

Given:
- Total students = 20
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students performing well in English only = 8

The rest of the students are good at both math and English. To find out how many students are good at both math and English, we subtract the number of students who are good at math only and those who are only good at English from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students performing well in English only}) \]

\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) \]

- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = 3/4 of the original amount = 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times \frac{225}{100} \times 3 = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2325 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of white shirts with collars and without collars.

- Total white shirts: 40
- White shirts with collars: 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars: 40 - 20 = 20

Next, let's determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons.

- Total floral shirts: 50
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts with no collars: 20

The difference is:

30 - 20 = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5. Since there are 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine the total number of goats left in both farms after the sales, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm.
2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.
3. Sum the remaining goats from both farms.

First, let's calculate the number of goats sold from each farm:
- From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Next, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm:
- The number of goats left in Farm X is \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- The number of goats left in Farm Y is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Finally, we sum the remaining goats from both farms:
- The total number of goats left is \(45 + 25 = 70\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Food**: Each basket costs $25.
2. **Cost of Red Food**: Each basket costs $18.
3. **Discount for Red Food**: For each basket of red food, you get $2 off.

First, calculate the total cost for 3 baskets of green food:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for 3 baskets of red food before any discount:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Now, apply the discount for each basket of red food. Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount for 3 baskets of red food is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Subtract the total discount from the original cost of the red food:
\[ 54 - 6 = 48 \]

Finally, add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food to find the total amount to be paid:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total amount to be paid is:

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many rooms need to be cleaned: One-half of 90 rooms is \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \) rooms.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms: Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time required is \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in hours is \( \frac{900}{60} = 15 \) hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, let's calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, they will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they will build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they will build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's sum up the homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 144."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( S = B - 3 \)
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( S = T + 2 \), where \( T \) is my sister's age.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \)
4. The sum of our ages is 87: \( S + B + T + M = 87 \)

Since \( S = T + 2 \), we can substitute \( T \) with \( S - 2 \). Now, we can substitute \( S \), \( B \), and \( M \) in the sum equation:
\[ S + B + (S - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
\[ 2S + 4B - 3 = 87 \]
\[ 2S + 4B = 90 \]
\[ S + 2B = 45 \]

From the first relationship \( S = B - 3 \), we can substitute \( S \) in the equation \( S + 2B = 45 \):
\[ (B - 3) + 2B = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 3 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 48 \]
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find \( S \):
\[ S = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes:

\[ 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons from the amount it had on the second day. Therefore, the amount of water on the third day is:

\[ 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:

\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

Initially, there are 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]
So, after Day 1, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 10 + 60 = 70 \]

**Day 2:**
Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others.
\[ 70 \times 6 = 420 \]
So, after Day 2, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 70 + 420 = 490 \]

**Day 3:**
Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others.
\[ 490 \times 6 = 2940 \]
So, after Day 3, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 490 + 2940 = 3430 \]

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is:
\[ 3430 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

"First, let's determine the number of green cars. Since there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars:

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars:

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[ \text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

Given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( y \). At that time, her age will be \( 8 + y \), and we want this to be three times her current age:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is purchasing:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - The total cost for the bacon is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is \( \frac{10}{5} = $2 \).

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Since a pack of bacon costs $2, a packet of chicken costs \( 2 \times 2 = $4 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for the chicken is \( 6 \times 4 = $24 \).

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the strawberries is \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs \( \frac{4}{2} = $2 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for the apples is \( 7 \times 2 = $14 \).

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

The total cost of all items is:
\[ 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = $60 \]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[ 65 - 60 = $5 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. After giving away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made each day and then sum them up.

- On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones are left after 20% of them are not able to fit in pairs. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate 20% of the total microphones:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs.

2. Subtract the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. Since the remaining microphones can be paired, we divide the number of paired microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. According to the problem, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ \text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding} \]
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the whirligig as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt:
- Salad: $6
- Yogurt: $3

The total cost for the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. Therefore, the cost for the two carrots she eats every day is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots every day, the cost for one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His original wage was $10 per hour, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours per week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars per week} \]

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is \( x + 3x + 5x = 9x \).

Given that Joe paid her $6 for mowing his lawn, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns as \( 6 \times 9x = 54x \).

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the amount she made from mowing lawns is $54x, and the amount she made from selling lemonade is \( 80 - 54x \).

Since we don't have the exact value of \( x \), we can't determine the exact amount from mowing lawns without additional information. However, we can express the amount from lemonade sales in terms of \( x \):

\[ \text{Amount from lemonade sales} = 80 - 54x \]

Without the specific value of \( x \), we cannot provide a numerical answer. If we assume \( x = 1 \) for simplicity (which would mean she mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times), then the amount from lemonade sales would be:

\[ 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer, assuming \( x = 1 \), is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. His profit is the total earnings minus his car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Therefore, the profit John makes on his car is:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed \(50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50\) miles.

Let's calculate the distance Anis rowed:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]
\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot and how it is divided among the family members.

The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup as well. This means that two adult bowls are already accounted for. The remaining two bowls of soup will be for the two children.

Since the pot can fill eight child's bowls, and there are two children, each child can have two bowls of soup from the leftover soup. Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch twice.

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen. Therefore, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives us the total amount William spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- 4 small masks require 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 small mask requires \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.

For large masks:
- 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 large mask requires \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.

Now, we calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks:
- Material for 20 small masks: \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.
- Material for 8 large masks: \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding these together gives the total material needed:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:

"Kira bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit. After Lola ate 2 pieces, the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12 pieces."
"First, let's determine the number of students playing each sport:

- Tennis: There are 6 students playing tennis.
- Volleyball: There are twice the number of students playing tennis, so \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) students playing volleyball.
- Soccer: There are 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is \( 16 + 22 = 38 \).

Now, let's add up the total number of students playing all the sports:

- Tennis: 6 students
- Volleyball: 12 students
- Soccer: 38 students

The total number of students is \( 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
56"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of Larry's pets, we will calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.

1. **Number of Cats:**
   Larry has 3 cats.

2. **Number of Dogs:**
   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Number of Fish:**
   Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Number of Gerbils:**
   Larry has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets:
\[
3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at age 5 and her 10th birthday marks the end of her collection period. To find out how many months she collected shells, we calculate the difference in age and then subtract one month (since she started collecting at age 5, not at age 4).

The difference in age is \(10 - 5 = 5\) years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months she collected shells is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows, so each row has \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, each row has \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since she has 27 cups in total, the remaining cups after dividing into rows are \( 27 - (3 \times 9) = 27 - 27 = 0 \) cups. This means there are no remaining cups to brew cinnamon tea, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Since each row has 4.5 cups of mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth picks berries and then use that rate to find out how many berries he can pick up in the given time.

First, let's break down the information:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to pick up berries, we can calculate the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours. Let's denote the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours as \( B \).

Given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the following proportion to find \( B \):

\[
\frac{B}{4 \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}}
\]

Solving for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ berries/hour}
\]

So, the sloth picks up 3 berries per hour. To find out how many berries he picks up in 4 hours:

\[
3 \text{ berries/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ berries}
\]

However, the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he picks up 12 berries in 4 hours, he needs to make another trip to collect the remaining berries. Therefore, the number of berries he needs to pick up in the second trip is:

\[
24 \text{ berries} - 12 \text{ berries} = 12 \text{ berries}
\]

Since he picks up 12 berries in 4 hours, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:

\[
\frac{12 \text{ berries}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ berries/hour}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars

Total cost of these items: \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars

Colby's total monthly budget is $150. After spending $24, his remaining budget is:
\[ 150 - 24 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money he can spend on tickets. Since it is a Friday, the ticket price is $10. He has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and 8 movies on other days, so the total number of movies he has already seen is:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ movies} \]

The cost of these movies is:
\[ 13 \times 10 = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has already spent $130 on tickets, he has no remaining budget for tickets. Therefore, he cannot see any more movies.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Adding these together gives the total calories from all the pastries:
\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85000 \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of toys Sophie has and the sum of the toys she already had.

The total number of toys Sophie has is 62.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

First, we add the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find Paul's age:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

And Peter's age:
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria also received 2 water balloons, so the total number of water balloons at this point is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding these to the previous total, the girls had \(10 + 15 = 25\) water balloons in total.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. The 10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total donation is:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes already owned by the charity group.

3. Adding these together gives the total number of boxes:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes (donated)} + 10 \text{ boxes (owned)} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. They can fit 2 boxes per table.

4. To find the number of tables needed, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

5. To find out how many new tables are needed, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables required:
   \[
   30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ new tables}
   \]

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:

\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:

\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by the number of people (which is 2):

\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total earnings for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the Widgeteer 3000:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 are \(1440 \times 6 = 8640\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(8640 \times 30 = 259200\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 are \(1080 \times 6 = 6480\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(6480 \times 30 = 194400\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The difference in earnings is \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours (24-hour stay) cost 1600 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 24-hour option is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 17-hour option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the 17-hour option from the total cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 2600 - 1350 = 1250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:
1250"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay needed:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings after gas} = 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his earnings after gas:
\[ \text{Earnings after deposit} = 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the earnings after the deposit:
\[ \text{Remaining money after pencils} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is \(2.25 \times 35\).
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, and James gets 10 new CDs, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original cost. So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the total amount he paid for the CDs:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

James then rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After resting, James swims the remaining 8 miles (20 miles - 12 miles) at half the speed, which is:

\[ \text{Speed for the remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes for James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, the rest time, and the swimming time for the remaining distance:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine seven times the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. Since Sam had seventy loaves, we calculate:

Therefore, the final number of stickers Jasmine has is 13."
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission from New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission from Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find Marcus's age, we start with the information that Deanna is 26 years old and Deanna is five years older than Marcus. Therefore, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, we can calculate Leo's age as follows:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the first two equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]
From the second equation, we can substitute \( B \) from the first equation:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the third equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- For every inch, there are 100 pages.

First, calculate the number of pages in 1 inch:
\[ \text{Pages per inch} = 100 \]

Next, calculate the number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ \text{Pages in 1.5 inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he worked and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
- 15 hours = 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes = 900 / 15 = 60 intervals.

Finally, we calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- If 1 interval (15 minutes) results in 30 reports, then 60 intervals will result in 60 * 30 reports.

Let's perform the multiplication:
- 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 6:00 \text{ a.m.} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time awake**: Adding the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time slept on the bed**: Subtracting the total time awake from the total sleep time:
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Remaining measuring spoons} + \text{Measuring cups} = 10 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially.

\[ \text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Now, we need to determine the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

We then calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks by subtracting the total number of patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied beds.

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 800 - 700 = 100 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"If Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people, which we will call \( x \):

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine how many balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes)

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the first day is:
\[ \text{Holes at the end of the first day} = \frac{29}{4} = 7.25 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context of digging holes, it seems there might be a slight discrepancy in the interpretation. However, for the purpose of this problem, we'll assume the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as it's the closest whole number).

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ \text{Holes at the end of the fourth day} = 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = 29 - 28 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received.

First, calculate the number of corn chips Collins received:
\[ \text{Collins' chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ 225 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, add this amount to the original cost of the supplies to find the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the total cost of the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
147"

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially and then account for the ones eaten and given away.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, 4 dozen brownies were waiting for her.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the brownies Greta had initially and subtract the ones eaten.

Total brownies initially:
\[
12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
\]

Brownies eaten during the party:
\[
18 \text{ brownies}

"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate the ages of each family member and then sum them up.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) years.

Now, we sum up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is 30."

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Total boxes bought: 12
- Boxes given to mom: 2
- Boxes given to sister: 2

Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4

So, the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington kept is:
12 - 4 = 8

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept is:
8 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 160 oranges

Since she kept 1/4 of the oranges, the total number of oranges she had initially is:
160 oranges * 4 = 640 oranges

Therefore, the number of oranges she sold is:
640 oranges - 160 oranges = 480 oranges

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the cost of the red car, we first calculate 40% of the price of the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:

\[ \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car and the price of the blue car:

\[ \$60 + \$100 = \$160 \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \(D\) and \(B\) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine the age of Emil's dad when he turns 24. Since Emil is currently 19, he will be 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

At that time, Emil's dad will be \(D + 5\) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for \(D\):
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. At that time, Emil will be 24, so his brother will be \(24 / 2 = 12\) years old. Since this will happen in 5 years, his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of beads given by Adrianne's sister and her friend.

Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her sister gave her:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ beads} \]

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her friend gave her:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we can find the total number of beads Adrianne has by adding the beads from her mother, her sister, and her friend:
\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has altogether is:
\[ 90 \]"
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(12 \div 2 = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is \(21 \div 3 = 7\).

The final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players in the class. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size five, Charlie's boots are size:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their shoe sizes together and divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower growth and spacing. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower grows to 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Converting 1.5 feet to inches:

\[ 1.5 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 18 \text{ inches} \]

So, each plant (including the space between them) takes up:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the 1332 inches of the flower bed:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants needed is:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 162 \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many he eats in a day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Edgar's brother eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) as many pretzels as Edgar. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, Edgar's brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

Now, to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we need to multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 (the number of months in a year).

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can either peel or saute shrimp simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated. In this case, it is 30 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature change during each phase of the air conditioner's operation.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Total cooling: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Total cooling: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Temperature increase: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Total increase: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, let's sum up the total cooling and the total increase in temperature:

- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)
- Total increase: \(4 \text{ degrees}\)

The net change in temperature is the total cooling minus the total increase:

- Net change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

Since the air conditioner was running and cooling the room, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw it for the second time.

3. **Determine the age difference between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the second sighting was 75 years after the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the information given:

1. He writes a check for the electric bill once per month.
2. He writes a check for the gas bill once per month.
3. He writes a check to the church twice per month.
4. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly (which is 4 times per year).

First, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the electric and gas bills:
- Electric bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)
- Gas bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)

Next, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the church:
- Church: 24 checks per year (twice per month)

Finally, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the pest and lawn service:
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (quarterly)

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill: 12 checks
- Gas bill: 12 checks
- Church: 24 checks
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks

Total number of checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks

The final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 22 \]"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias's howl duration**: 20 seconds
2. **Chikote's howl duration**: Twice as long as Tobias's, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds
3. **Igneous's howl duration**: As long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds

Now, we sum up the durations:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total duration in seconds:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. So, the total amount of money given by his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the amount he spent on trousers.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age = 3 years
- Alessandro's age = 4 years
- Helene's age = \( H \) years
- Wilfred's age = \( W \) years

We know the total age of the children is 20 years:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is 3 years. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:

- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by Walter's friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we calculate the lawyer's contribution, which is three times the amount donated by everyone else:

- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200
- Lawyer's contribution: 3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( V \), we have:
\[ 8x = V \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon, and since \( 8x = V \), each adult's share is:
\[ \frac{2x}{V} = \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on checking on the inpatients. He has 9 inpatients, and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 180 minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time he will spend on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session:
- Fixed cost per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions in a month. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, we need to know the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, let's assume a month has 4 weeks.

- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: 4
- Total number of sessions in a month: 3 * 4 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:

- Total number of sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: $40 * 12 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool at $0.10 per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate this volume.
```python
# Dimensions of the pool
length = 25  # in feet
width = 14   # in feet
depth = 4    # in feet

# Calculate the volume in cubic feet
volume_cubic_feet = length * width * depth
volume_cubic_feet
```
```output
1400
```
The volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert this volume to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's calculate the number of gallons.
```python
# Conversion factor from cubic feet to gallons
conversion_factor = 5.9

# Calculate the number of gallons
gallons_needed = volume_cubic_feet * conversion_factor
gallons_needed
```
```output
NameError: name 'volume_cubic_feet' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference. Let me re-calculate the number of gallons directly using the previously calculated volume.

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's perform this calculation.
```python
# Recalculating the number of gallons
gallons_needed = 1400 * 5.9
gallons_needed
```
```output
8260.0
```
The number of gallons needed to fill the pool is 8260 gallons.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool at $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate the cost.
```python
# Cost per gallon
cost_per_gallon = 0.10

# Calculate the cost
cost_to_fill = gallons_needed * cost_per_gallon
cost_to_fill
```
```output
NameError: name 'gallons_needed' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference again. Let me re-calculate the cost directly using the previously calculated number of gallons.

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's perform this calculation.

"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is:

\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is:

\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks they have is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, we calculate the distance each person traveled.

Matteo's distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy's distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining three-fourths of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how many gallons are remaining:

- Remaining gallons: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.652 \]

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.652 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.817 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.817 = 0.28 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.652 \times 0.817} \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \]
\[ C \approx 0.523 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.3%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how many pieces of sweets she gave to her friends, we subtract the number of pieces she kept from the total number of pieces:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums to portraits. This means the remaining albums are for other types of pictures, but we don't need to know the exact number of those for this calculation.

First, let's find out how many pictures were placed in each album. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and they are divided into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Now, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits combined is:

\[ \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

Since each album contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests over the course of the day.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

- 24 guests checked out early.
- 15 guests checked out late.
- Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests.
- 7 more people checked in after dinner was served.

Let's calculate the number of guests after each change:

1. After 24 guests checked out early:
\[ 100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests} \]

2. After 15 guests checked out late:
\[ 76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests} \]

3. After 30 guests checked in:
\[ 61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests} \]

4. After 7 more guests checked in:

\[4 + 6 + 12 = 22\]

So, the final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. Therefore, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. Therefore, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Adding these up, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct is:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals are sold at three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can write the equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into the expression for the number of small stuffed animals:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"First, let's calculate Suzanne's earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$300 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds per day.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the proportionality between the number of sandwiches and the price.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first two packages:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- The cost for 8 sandwiches is:
  \[
  8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons.

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of convincing the teacher to give a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework = 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension and not convincing the teacher: 60% * 80% = 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.48
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 100% - 48% = 52% or 0.52

Now, we combine the probabilities of both scenarios:

- Probability of having to turn in the homework = Probability of substitute teacher * Probability of having to turn in the homework (substitute teacher) + Probability of normal teacher * Probability of having to turn in the homework (normal teacher)
- Probability of having to turn in the homework = 0.50 * 0.50 + 0.50 * 0.52
- Probability of having to turn in the homework = 0.25 + 0.26
- Probability of having to turn in the homework = 0.51

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates and faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. We do this by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total width of the driveway}}{\text{Distance between each bottle}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the seventh to the eighth), he will need to make 7 trips.

Each trip takes 5 seconds, so the total time for all trips is:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Number of trips} \times \text{Time per trip} = 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Mozzarella cheese is 3 pounds.
- The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese Amor bought:
- Total cost = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of mozzarella cheese
- Total cost = 22 + 18 = 40 dollars.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she has left to buy meat, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money:
- Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
- Money left = 50 - 40 = 10 dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years, so the total income he would have earned is:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

The money lost from not working while in school is the difference between the total income he would have earned and the total income he actually earned:

\[ 100,000 - 75,000 = 25,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed and the money he lost from not working while in school:

\[ 200,000 + 25,000 = 225,000 \]

To find out how long it would take for Jim to earn this amount, we divide the total amount by his new income:

\[ \frac{225,000}{75,000} = 3 \]

Therefore, it would take Jim 3 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Deliveries**: The post office delivered 425 letters.
2. **Tuesday's Deliveries**: The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number delivered on Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's deliveries: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
3. **Wednesday's Deliveries**: The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's deliveries: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Wednesday's deliveries: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

Now, let's sum up the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:
- Monday: 425 letters
- Tuesday: 102 letters
- Wednesday: 209 letters

Total deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

The final numerical answer is:

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = $5 * 2 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating the total loss, we consider the amount lost, which is $0.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - Amount lost in the third race = 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the third race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss per race = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss per race = $21.5 / 3 = $7.1667 (rounded to four decimal places)

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.1667}

\[ 130 \times 1000 = 130000 \]

Therefore, the total number of people in South America is:
\[ 130000 \]"
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks of work.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, each painter worked \( \frac{7.875}{4} \) hours.

5. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   \[
   \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( t \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Now, we substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Calculating \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads per week = 2 (twin beds) + 1 (king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads Greg does in a year is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the visit: $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120
4. The cost of parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we sum these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

Total cost = Cost of the cast + Cost of the visit + Cost of the painkillers + Cost of parking
Total cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12
Total cost = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James does not respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails do not require any response, we calculate 20% of 80:

\[ 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James does not respond to 16 emails a day. This means he responds to the remaining emails:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 320."

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 20 \times 0.7 = 14 \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the football team has:

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending out 700 small coupons:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending out 1400 big coupons:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This leaves Sidney with \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches, bringing her total back to \(3 + 3 = 6\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is:
24"
"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, which means:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

These 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 300 \]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis pays for 1 pound and gets the second pound at half price.

3. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter under the promotion:**
   - Dennis will pay full price for the first pound.
   - For the next 5 pounds, he will pay full price for 4 pounds and half price for 1 pound.
   - The cost for the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost for the next 4 pounds at full price is:
     \[
     4 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$16.00
     \]
   - The cost for the next 1 pound at half price is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pound} \times \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \$4.00/\text{pound}\right) = \$2.00
     \]
   - Adding these together gives the total cost:
     \[
     \$4.00 + \$16.00 + \$2.00 = \$22.00
     \]

Therefore, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the promotion is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend: 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we need to calculate the cost. The base fee for renting the theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests.

- Additional guests beyond the initial 20: 41 - 20 = 21
- Additional cost: 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the base fee to the additional cost to get the total cost:

- Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{4}M \). The amount of money she has left is:
\[ M - \frac{1}{4}M = \frac{3}{4}M \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{3}R \). The amount of money she has left is:
\[ R - \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{2}{3}R \]

Since both Maggie and Riza initially had $60, we can substitute \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \) into the expressions for the money they have left:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

The total amount of money they have left together is:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 (from the first puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the dozen roses she bought. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15 roses, she bought 1.25 dozen roses (since 15 roses is 1.25 times a dozen). However, since the cost is only given for a dozen, we can directly use the cost of a dozen for the calculation:

\[ \$15 \]

So, the total cost for the roses is $15. Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

The amount of money Jenny has left after paying for the roses is:

\[ \$25 - \$15 = \$10 \]

Since the florist only gives change in quarters, we need to determine how many quarters Jenny gets for $10. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters is:

\[ \frac{\$10}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 40 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ 40 \]"

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes).
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, we need to determine how long Paul will wait for his train. Since Paul arrives at the station at the time the fourth train arrives (85 minutes), and the fourth train is the one he needs to board, he will wait 0 minutes.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so the number of toothpicks she still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish per second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is 72000."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given:

1. Binkie's score is 90.
2. Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Then, add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. Therefore, the total distance he walked is:

\[ 2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually at $0.80 each is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \text{Final numerical answer: } \$2.00 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of an MTB = $500
- Price of a BMX bike = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of a Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, John spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, John spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

4. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, John spends \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes on Saturday and Sunday combined.

5. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends learning each week:**
   - John spends 1600 minutes in class each week.
   - John spends 100 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, John spends \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes learning each week.

6. **Convert the total number of minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, John spends \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 10}{60 \div 10} = \frac{170}{6} = 28.3333...\) hours learning each week.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Given that the ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities accordingly.

Initially, Ellen has:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 9 unshaken sodas

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 8 unshaken sodas

Ellen's brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving:
- 2 shaken sodas
- 6 unshaken sodas

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. The friend can get soda from a shaken can if they get one of the 2 remaining shaken sodas. The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8 sodas.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Time difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final numerical answer is 2 minutes."
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we first need to determine the daily total and then multiply by the number of days.

Bobby's daily break time is:
- 30 minutes for lunch
- 2 breaks of 15 minutes each

So, the total break time per day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 2 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour on his lunches and breaks each day.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunches and breaks is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the credit card is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

1. Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
\[ 20.00 - (20.00 \times 0.20) = 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

2. Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
\[ 30.00 - (30.00 \times 0.10) = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the credit card:

Remaining balance: $70.00
Frying pan: $16.00
Set of towels: $27.00

Total charge for the new purchases:
\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

We know that the number of jellyfish that change color is 6, which is equal to \( \frac{T}{15} \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

\[
\boxed{90}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Lauren saves each year and then figure out how many years she needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan.

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Annual living cost} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total retirement cost} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save \$800,000:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we need to determine how many more years she needs to work beyond the initial 20 years to reach the total retirement cost.

4. **Determine the additional years Lauren needs to work:**
   \[
   \text{Additional years} = 40 \text{ years} - 20 \text{ years} = 20 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, Lauren needs to work an additional 20 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

"To find out the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 centimeters by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 centimeters by 5:
   \[

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times T \]

Substituting the total number of students \( T = 600 \):
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after the purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish:
- He buys 2 more male guppies, so he now has \(4 + 2 = 6\) male guppies.
- He buys 1 more female guppy, so he now has \(7 + 1 = 8\) female guppies.
- He buys 2 more male goldfishes, so he now has \(3 + 2 = 5\) male goldfishes.
- He buys 3 more female goldfishes, so he now has \(5 + 3 = 8\) female goldfishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: \(6\) (male guppies) + \(5\) (male goldfishes) = \(11\)
- Total female fishes: \(8\) (female guppies) + \(8\) (female goldfishes) = \(16\)

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. For the sake of calculation, let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption that is more than 8 hours).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \text{ hours}

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of the first two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 + 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of the next two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 + 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The first two workers together produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers together produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, the total production rate of the first four workers is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

However, the first four workers only produced 200 toys in 10 hours. This indicates that the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys to meet the order requirements. The number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce is:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

Since the fifth worker works for a 10-hour shift, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight of both sets of dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he gave away, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \). Simplifying, we get \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equals 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these 80 planks at $1.2 per plank:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire walk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. If she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk in 10 minutes, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent on the entire walk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, and the time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jane has already saved.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount, given she saves $4 each week.

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She needs to save a total of $60, so the remaining amount she needs to save is:
\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:
\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the initial number of marbles \( x \):

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk if the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the water poured into the bottle. The formula for the weighted average temperature is:

\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We need this average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \), we solve the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug of water must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
68

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
\[ \text{Initial cows} + \text{Cows added} = 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Initial chickens} + \text{Chickens added} = 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since Russell is ordering 4 packs, he will receive a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell will receive. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, 4 packs will contain:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is $1.00. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
- Total eggs in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

The final numerical answer is 20 dozens."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Given:
- Total number of jellybeans = 60
- Number of green jellybeans = 17
- Number of red jellybeans = 2 * number of green jellybeans

Let's calculate the number of red jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = \text{Total number of jellybeans} - (\text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans}) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (17 + 34) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Adam buys 20 rocks and then sells 60% of them. Let's calculate how many rocks he sells.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each.

\[ \text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam initially invested $100 in buying the rocks. Now, let's calculate the cost of the 20 rocks he bought.

\[ \text{Cost of 20 rocks} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \]

Adam's profit or loss can be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

\[ \text{Profit or Loss} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = 84 - 100 = -16 \]

Adam loses $16. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, let's denote the probability of winning with the first ticket as \( P(W_1) \). According to the problem, \( P(W_1) = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket, \( P(W_2) \), is:
\[ P(W_2) = 3 \times P(W_1) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1) \times P(W_2) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the number of purple-wearers wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:

"To find Geb's age, we first need to calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so:

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Face masks used per outing**: Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
2. **Outings per day**: Tyrion goes out three times a day.

First, calculate the number of face masks used per day:
\[ \text{Face masks per outing} \times \text{Outings per day} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Next, calculate the number of face masks used in 2 days:
\[ \text{Face masks per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) eggs.
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) eggs.
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) eggs.

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from each of the three complexes 3 times a week:

\[ 3 \times (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1248 \]"
"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to determine the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850 \]

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1850."
"Sophia gave Jack \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) into the third equation:

\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her initial amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left:**
   - Rissa initially had $15 and gave $3 to her sister.
   - Therefore, Rissa is left with \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and did not give any money to his sister.
   - Therefore, Ronnie is left with \(5\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

Also, half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can write the equation for the total paint as:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting \( W = R \) and \( P = R \) into the equation, we get:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 3R = 6 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms:
\[ \text{Total area of the bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the remaining area of the house is 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:

"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 2 * Monday's count = 2 * 3 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93 puffs

The total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts at the end of the week is 93."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box.

The original box contains 100 pods and costs $12. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. Therefore, the number of pods in the new box is:
\[ 100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The new box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the new box is:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank. Since he withdrew $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of bills as follows:

\[ \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home, so the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has after tripling is:

\[ 20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.
3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
4. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which means team A scores \(8 / 4 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in total.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. Therefore, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the chalk remaining after Monday is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Chalk Usage Rate**: The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. Therefore, the chalk remaining after each day can be calculated as follows:
   - After the first day (Tuesday), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the second day (Wednesday), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the third day (Thursday), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the fourth day (Friday), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the fifth day (Saturday), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.89952 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the sixth day (Sunday), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     0.89952 \times 0.80 = 0.719616 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the seventh day (Monday of the next week), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     0.719616 \times 0.80 = 0.5756928 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the eighth day (Tuesday of the next week), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     0.5756928 \times 0.80 = 0.46055424 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the ninth day (Wednesday of the next week), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     0.46055424 \times 0.80 = 0.368443392 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the tenth day (Thursday of the next week), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     0.368443392 \times 0.80 = 0.2947547136 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the eleventh day (Friday of the next week), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     0.2947547136 \times 0.80 = 0.23580377088 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the twelfth day (Saturday of the next week), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     0.23580377088 \times 0.80 = 0.188643016704 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the thirteenth day (Sunday of the next week), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     0.188643016704 \times 0.80 = 0.1509144133632 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the fourteenth day (Monday of the next week), the chalk remaining is:
     \[
     0.1509144133632 \times 0.80 = 0.12073153069056 \text{ inches}
     \]

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The chalk remaining after the fourteenth day is approximately 0.1207 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the fourteenth day.

The number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece is:

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

Number of girls not on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of girls not on varsity} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Number of boys not on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of boys not on varsity} = 12 - 3 = 9 \]

Finally, we add the number of girls and boys not on varsity to find the total number of students not on varsity:
\[ \text{Total number of students not on varsity} = 8 + 9 = 17 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (5):

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' teeth (which is 30) are fixed. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. So, the amount of milk that was returned is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Since the company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the returned milk is:

\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:

\[ \$5600 \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by calculating Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Now, let's check the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20 years. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000. Given that he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of books he can buy per $500:

\[ \text{Number of books per $500} = 100 \]

Next, we find out how many $500 units are in $27,000:

\[ \text{Number of $500 units} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Since each $500 unit allows him to buy 100 books, the total number of books he can buy with $27,000 is:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Bob distributes the $27,000 equally among 3 schools, so the number of books he can buy per school is:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since Kate needs to buy enough cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to satisfy her friends' consumption, and both require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can actually make in an hour, accounting for the ones that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt, leaving him with 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs.

To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in an hour, we divide 60 minutes by 15 minutes per interval, which gives us 4 intervals in an hour.

In 4 intervals, the number of snowballs Jay loses is 4 intervals * 2 melted snowballs per interval = 8 snowballs.

So, in an hour, Jay effectively makes 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to make 60 snowballs, given that he makes 12 snowballs per hour.

We divide the total number of snowballs needed by the number of snowballs he can make in an hour: 60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon series came out, we can determine Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2. 

So, Jim's age at that time was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since the question asks for Jim's current age, and no information is given about the passage of time since the series came out, we can conclude that Jim is currently 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

The total number of slices they all ate is:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's recheck the bandages used and ordered on the third day:

- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they should have \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages left after ordering.
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, which means they must have had \(78 + 25 = 103\) bandages at the end of the second day.

So, at the end of the second day, they had 103 bandages. This means they used \(103 - 22 = 81\) bandages on the second day, which is consistent with using 28 bandages on the second day and ordering 50 bandages on the first day.

Now, let's calculate the initial number of bandages they had on the first day:
- At the end of the first day, they had 50 bandages.
- They used 38 bandages on the first day, so they must have had \(50 + 38 = 88\) bandages at the start of the first day.

Thus, the initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is 88."
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is:

\[ 10 - 8 = 2 \text{ inches} \]

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is:

\[ 60 + 40 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she had complete attendance for the month, she receives an extra $10 for each week, which amounts to \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
310"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the corresponding amount he earns for that task, and then sum these amounts.

- For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each instance. So, the earnings from emptying the dishwasher are \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each instance. So, the earnings from doing laundry are \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each instance. So, the earnings from taking the trash out are \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
- For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each instance. So, the earnings from cleaning his room are \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up all the groups of people who entered.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She bought twice the amount of black pens, so she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens. This means she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. 

The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on both scotch and cognac by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we need to calculate the number of trees planted each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
Thus, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[ 60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To determine how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after each event and then divide by the number of people at the party.

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. So, Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors. Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors she has left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the second floor:
\[ \text{Height of the roof from the floor of the second floor} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 700 \times 0.4 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 420 \times 0.6 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 168 \]"
"Let's denote the number of miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total number of miles the four dogs need to walk per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

According to the problem, the average number of miles the dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total number of miles they need to walk per day is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the loan amount John gets. The loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debt} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money he has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off the debts from the loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

Trinity bought the magazines at $72 each. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. Therefore, the selling price is:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is:

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then multiply by the number of days it was used at that setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.

"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

John has two classes, so the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest.

The interest is 2% of $300:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months:
\[ \text{Total Payment for 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount, which will be paid in the twelfth month, is the total amount minus the amount paid over the 11 months:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = \text{Volume of the jar} \times \text{Packing efficiency} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Pauline visits the museum three times a year.
   - The initial cost per visit is $2.
   - Over one year, the total cost is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Over 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) dollars.

2. **Cost Increase Calculation:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the cost is now \(2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5\) dollars per visit.

3. **Cost for the Next 3 Years:**
   - For the next 3 years, Pauline continues to visit the museum three times a year.
   - The cost per visit is now $5.
   - Over one year, the total cost is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
   - Over 3 years, the total cost is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The total cost over the 8 years (5 years + 3 years) is the sum of the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = \(30 + 45 = 75\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group spends.

1. There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), so the total number of students is:

The cost for the roof frames is:
\[ 2 \text{ frames} \times \$10 \text{ per frame} = \$20 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \$80 + \$20 = \$100 \]

So, Ali has to pay John:
\[ \$100 \]"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \):

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[
\text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
10

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts or additional charges:

- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

The total cost for both services without any discounts or additional charges is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for getting both services:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 fingers per hand, and 5 hands), and each nail art service costs $3:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Now, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost of the services:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of issues Susan receives from each magazine:

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's sum up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each magazine is counted as one unit, the total number of magazines Susan receives every year is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour for these lessons. He has 4 such lessons today:

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80/\text{hour} = \$320 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate:

\[ 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60/\text{hour} \]

Charlie has 2 lessons at this reduced rate:

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60/\text{hour} = \$120 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Sum all the scores.
2. Divide the sum by the number of scores.

Let's start by summing the scores:

\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Adding these step by step:

\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

The total sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of scores. There are 9 scores in total.

\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is 70."

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}

"If Regina wrote 9 novels last year and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of novels she has written this year:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels she has written this year, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the number of novels this year:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is:

"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother to make the grape juice.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother is the sum of the grapes they used, we can set up the following equation to find the initial number of grapes:
\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Thus, the initial number of grapes at the beginning is:

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the calculation. The custodian works 8 hours a day, and they need 20 hours to clean all the classrooms. This means they would need to work more than one day to complete the task. Given the constraint of 5 days, we can calculate the average time spent cleaning per day:

\[ \text{Average time spent cleaning per day} = \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all of them:

- The number of bookcases needed is the total number of books divided by the capacity of one bookcase: \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings can be calculated by dividing the total number of eggs by 3 and then multiplying by $1:

\[ \frac{60}{3} \times 1 = 20 \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

"To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \(72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish."
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 4
   - Water per plant: 0.5 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 8
   - Water per plant: 1 cup
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)
   - Water per plant: 0.25 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups

Now, we sum up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water = Water for half a cup plants + Water for 1 cup plants + Water for quarter cup plants
- Total water = \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

The time taken to hop 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks and Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the additional phones and then add it to the cost of the main phone.

Given:
- The main phone costs $20.
- The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the main phone costs \( 2x \). Since the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. There are four additional phones, so the total cost for the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we have:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:
\[ 7200 \]

- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair of pants} = \$16.00\)

Now, we add these amounts to find the total weekly cost:
\[ \$25.00 + \$6.00 + \$16.00 = \$47.00 \]

Finally, to find the cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
\[ \$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00 \]

So, Alicia spends \$235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's determine John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time in minutes can be calculated by dividing the total number of words by the speaking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people present each day and then sum them up.

1. **First Day:**
   Conor found 50 people at the beach.

2. **Second Day:**
   The number of people on the second day was 20 more than on the first day.
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Third Day:**
   The total number of people on the third day was twice the number that were there on the second day.
   \[
   2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Average for the Rest of the Week:**
   Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (which includes the fourth, fifth, and sixth days).

5. **Total for the Rest of the Week:**
   Since there are 3 days left in the week and he saw an average of 60 people each day:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ people}
   \]

6. **Total Number of People for the Week:**
   Adding the number of people from all days:
   \[

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we will calculate the number of kernels popping in each 30-second interval and then sum them up, including the additional kernels that pop after the pan is removed from the heat.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds pop, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40\) kernels.

Now, we sum the kernels popped in the first three intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After the pan is removed from the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that pop from the residual heat is:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\]

Adding these to the total from the initial intervals, we get:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of popped kernels Garrett has to eat is:
\[210\]"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade:
- Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
- For 4 gallons, he needs \(4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).
- Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 4 cups of juice, he needs \(4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

Next, consider the extra gallon that is twice as tart:
- This extra gallon also requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he needs 6 lemons for this extra gallon.

Adding the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:
- Total lemons needed = 24 (for 4 gallons) + 6 (for the extra gallon) = 30 lemons.

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is 30."
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first calculate the daily consumption for both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then extend that to a weekly basis.

For the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Adding the daily consumption of both breeds:
- Total daily consumption = \(15 + 6 = 21\) kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- Total weekly consumption = \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

Thus, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

The total number of blocks can be expressed as the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled west:
- Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled east:
- Elvis drives east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."

"First, let's determine the number of orange and yellow candies based on the given information:

- The number of red candies is 54.
- The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it is \(2 \times 54 = 108\).
- The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it is \(54 / 2 = 27\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: 108
- Yellow candies: 27

Adding these together gives the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumption by Dexter's pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig consumes in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs each eat 8 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, the total feed consumption for five pigs in one day is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption for five pigs over a week (7 days):
- The total feed consumption for five pigs in one day is 40 pounds.
- Therefore, the total feed consumption for five pigs in 7 days is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumption from the amount ordered:
- Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.

1. The ages of the sisters are all 16 years old. Since there are 3 sisters, their total age is:
   \[
   3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ years}
   \]

2. One of the brothers is 12 years old. The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so the older brother is:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. The total age of the brothers is:
   \[
   12 + 24 = 36 \text{ years}
   \]

4. Now, we sum the total ages of all the siblings:
   \[
   48 \text{ (sisters)} + 36 \text{ (brothers)} = 84 \text{ years}
   \]

The total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break down the activities and their durations.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
- Therefore, she meditates for 30 minutes each day.
- She meditates 5 days a week.

So, the time spent on meditation per week is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 150 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) each day.
- She practices yoga 5 days a week.

So, the time spent on yoga per week is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, let's find the total time spent on both meditation and yoga per week:
\[ 150 \text{ minutes/week} + 300 \text{ minutes/week} = 450 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Finally, to find the total time spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 30 hours."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum them up.

For the small t-shirts:
\[ 11 \text{ small t-shirts} \times 3 \text{ square feet per small t-shirt} = 33 \text{ square feet} \]

For the medium t-shirts:
\[ 8 \text{ medium t-shirts} \times 4 \text{ square feet per medium t-shirt} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

For the large t-shirts:
\[ 6 \text{ large t-shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet per large t-shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we sum up the square footage from all the t-shirts:
\[ 33 \text{ square feet} + 32 \text{ square feet} + 36 \text{ square feet} = 101 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"
"If George has 18 pens, then Timothy has three times that amount, which is \( 3 \times 18 = 54 \) pens.

"To determine the total money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bars.

First, the company produces 5000 bars per day. Therefore, in two weeks (which is 14 days), the company will produce:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Next, the company sells each bar for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 70000 bars is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 140000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off the original price.

The discounted price of the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the two T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.4) = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores:

\[ \text{Allowance per week} = \$6 \]
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = 3 \]
\[ \text{Total allowance} = 6 \times 3 = \$18 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones:

\[ \text{Cost per ice cream cone} = \$1.25 \]
\[ \text{Number of ice cream cones} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of ice cream cones} = 1.25 \times 4 = \$5 \]

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left for the movie tickets:

\[ \text{Money left for movie tickets} = 18 - 5 = \$13 \]

Finally, let's determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money:

\[ \text{Cost per movie ticket} = \$6.50 \]
\[ \text{Number of movie tickets Ryan can buy} = \left\lfloor \frac{13}{6.50} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent:
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total for Ellen = $100 + $5 = $105

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 each, so 2 * $100 = $200
Total for Lani = $30 + $200 = $230

Now, let's add the totals for Ellen and Lani to find the overall amount spent:
Total spent = Total for Ellen + Total for Lani
Total spent = $105 + $230 = $335

The final numerical answer is $335."
"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
  \[
  1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20
  \]

Now, let's find the total cost for one jar:
\[
\$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[
10 \text{ jars} \times \$44/\text{jar} = \$440
\]

Tim sells each jar for $50. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[
10 \text{ jars} \times \$50/\text{jar} = \$500
\]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
\$500 - \$440 = \$60
\]

Thus, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

- Nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $6.00
- Pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01/penny = $7.50

Now, we sum these values to get the total dollar amount:

Total = $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given by her parents:

Amount left = $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh works in one week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in one week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find his earnings in 2 weeks.

Josh works from Monday to Saturday, excluding Sunday and Wednesday. This means he works 5 days a week.

He services 3 cars a day, so in one week, he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

To find his earnings in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

The final numerical answer is 23."
"To calculate the total amount of money Matthew would earn, we need to break down the collection into two halves and calculate the earnings from each half separately.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so each half would consist of 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 each):
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 each):
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 72."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes a day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. The net effect is that 3 holes are filled each day (since 9 holes are filled minus 6 holes are dug):

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day filled} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes. Since 3 holes are filled each day, the number of days required to fill in all the holes is:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given:
- Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students.
- Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School.

First, calculate the enrollment at Butler High School:
\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \]

So, Butler High School enrolls an average of 3000 students.

Next, we find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1000 \]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor picked up the correct number, which is 7 beakers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these together gives:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

Dr. Grumpus wanted a total of 29 items on the lab bench. Since Igor gathered 31 items, he must have lost some. The number of items lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2."
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by Alexandra, Kim, Sarah, and Maryam:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Let's add these amounts step by step:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \(d_A\) miles.
   - Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa's speed is \(v_V\) miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is \(2v_V\) miles per minute.
   - Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can write the equation for the distance Aaron ran as:
     \[
     d_A = 16 \times 2v_V = 32v_V
     \]

2. **Determine Vanessa's distance:**
   - We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Therefore:
     \[
     4 = 2d_A
     \]
   - Solving for \(d_A\):
     \[
     d_A = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Verify the consistency:**
   - We have \(d_A = 2\) miles and from the speed relationship, \(d_A = 32v_V\).
   - Substituting \(d_A = 2\) into \(d_A = 32v_V\):
     \[
     2 = 32v_V \implies v_V = \frac{2}{32} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Determine Vanessa's time:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of \(\frac{1}{16}\) miles per minute.
   - The time \(t_V\) Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is:
     \[
     t_V = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."

"First, we need to calculate the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times \frac{25}{100} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Since James is currently 18 years old, and he was born when his father John was 19, we can calculate John's current age. Since James is 18 years old, John is \(19 + 18 = 27\) years older than James, meaning John is currently \(19 + 18 = 27\) years old.

Now, let's determine the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(32 - 27 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. So, the discount amount is:

\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the cost for the mechanic is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:
