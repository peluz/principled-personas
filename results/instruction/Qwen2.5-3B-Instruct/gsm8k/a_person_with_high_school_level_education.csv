"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
3. She uses 4 eggs to make muffins for her friends.
4. The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market.

To find out how many eggs are left for sale, we subtract the eggs used for breakfast and the eggs used for muffins from the total eggs laid:

\[ \text{Eggs left for sale} = \text{Total eggs} - \text{Eggs eaten for breakfast} - \text{Eggs used for muffins} \]

\[ \text{Eggs left for sale} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Now, Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. So, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ \text{Total money made} = \text{Eggs left for sale} \times \text{Price per egg} \]

\[ \text{Total money made} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. So, half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, to find the total number of bolts, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber together:

2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts in total.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

Josh initially bought the house for $80,000 and then added $50,000 in repairs, making the total cost $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The house's value increased by 150%. To find out how much the value increased, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$130,000 = 1.5 \times \$130,000 = \$195,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ \$130,000 + \$195,000 = \$325,000 \]

Now, to find out the profit Josh made, we subtract the original cost of the house and the repairs from the new value:
\[ \$325,000 - \$130,000 = \$195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is $195,000."
"To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the total meters James runs in one sprint:
   - James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. Next, determine how many sprints James runs in a week:
   - James runs 3 sprints each day.
   - He runs 3 times a week.

3. Calculate the total number of sprints James runs in a week:
   - Total sprints per week = Sprints per day * Days per week
   - Total sprints per week = 3 sprints/day * 3 days/week = 9 sprints/week.

4. Now, calculate the total meters James runs in a week:
   - Total meters per week = Total sprints per week * Meters per sprint
   - Total meters per week = 9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week.

So, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.

So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Since she has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total feed needed for all the chickens in a day is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Now, to find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed:
60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the first glass:** $5
2. **Cost of the second glass:** 60% of $5 = 0.60 * $5 = $3
3. **Cost of the third glass:** $5
4. **Cost of the fourth glass:** 60% of $5 = $3

We can see that every second glass costs $3, and the rest cost $5. So, for every 2 glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can group these glasses into sets of 2:

- There are 8 sets of 2 glasses in 16 glasses.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- Cost for 8 sets = 8 * $8 = $64

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"First, let's find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:

\[ \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:

\[ \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city:

\[ \text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"First, let's calculate how much of the file Carla has downloaded before the restart. Since the file is 200 GB and she has downloaded 40% of it before the restart, we can calculate the amount downloaded as follows:

\[ 200 \text{ GB} \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

This means that 80 GB of the file is already downloaded, and she has 120 GB left to download. Normally, she can download 2 GB per minute. To find out how long it would take her to download the remaining 120 GB at this rate:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since she had to restart the download after the 20-minute Windows update, we need to add this 20 minutes to the 60 minutes it would take to download the rest of the file:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John covers in the first 3 hours at 60 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home after the first 3 hours.

Next, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the 0.5 hours, he drives for the remaining 3.5 hours at 80 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 3.5 \, \text{hours} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up the distances he covered:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 280 \, \text{miles} = 475 \, \text{miles} \]

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 475 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
- Regular rate = $10 per hour
- Regular hours = 40 hours
- Earnings for regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Overtime hours are the hours worked beyond the first 40 hours:
- Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
- Overtime rate = Regular rate * 1.2 = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour
- Earnings for overtime hours = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to get her total earnings for the week:
- Total earnings = Earnings for regular hours + Earnings for overtime hours = $400 + $60 = $460

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460."
"First, let's calculate the number of downloads in the second month. If the first month had 60 downloads and the second month had three times as many, then:

\[ \text{Downloads in second month} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

Next, we need to find out how many downloads there were in the third month. The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month. So, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180:

\[ \text{Reduction} = 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \]
\[ \text{Downloads in third month} = 180 - 54 = 126 \]

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:

\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen. So, the cost for the donuts is:
\[ 3 \times 68 = 204 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen. So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen. So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is:
\[ 6 \times 55 = 330 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total cost:
\[ 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \]

So, the total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find out when it becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

To find \(n\), we solve the inequality:
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}\]
\[n \geq 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. So, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This means she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. According to the problem, after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Next, add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

Now, multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):
\[
2x = 36
\]

Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by going through the steps again with \( x = 18 \):

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, our solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in jazz dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students, which is 12 students, enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out what percentage of the entire class this represents, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market increase and then find the difference between the future value of the more profitable item and its original cost.

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
- Original value of jewelry = $5,000
- Expected increase in jewelry market = 2.5%

The increase in value of the jewelry can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Increase in jewelry value} = 5000 \times \frac{2.5}{100} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \]

So, the future value of the jewelry will be:
\[ \text{Future value of jewelry} = 5000 + 125 = 5125 \]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
- Original value of electronic gadgets = $8,000
- Expected increase in electronic gadgets market = 1.2%

The increase in value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Increase in electronic gadgets value} = 8000 \times \frac{1.2}{100} = 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \]

So, the future value of the electronic gadgets will be:
\[ \text{Future value of electronic gadgets} = 8000 + 96 = 8096 \]

Now, we can find the profit for each item:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Original value of jewelry = 5125 - 5000 = 125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Original value of electronic gadgets = 8096 - 8000 = 96

Comparing the profits, the jewelry has a higher profit of $125 compared to the electronic gadgets' profit of $96.

Therefore, the merchant should choose to purchase the jewelry to maximize profit. The profit from this choice would be:
\[ \boxed{125} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each train traveled over the two days.

First, let's calculate the distance covered by each train traveling westward:
- Each train travels 80 miles westward.

Next, let's calculate the distance covered by each train traveling northward:
- Each train travels 150 miles northward.

Now, we add the distances from both directions to find the total distance each train traveled:
- Total distance for each train = Distance traveled westward + Distance traveled northward
- Total distance for each train = 80 miles + 150 miles
- Total distance for each train = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"First, let's calculate Jill's annual earnings from teaching. She gets paid $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \times 35 = 700 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \times 50 = 35000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from being a cheerleading coach. She gets paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \times 15 = 450 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \times 50 = 22500 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find her total annual salary, we add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching:
\[ 35000 + 22500 = 57500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ 57500 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To solve this, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. First, determine how many eggs Claire uses in one day.
   - Claire uses 3 eggs each day.

2. Next, find out how many eggs she uses in one week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, in one week, Claire uses \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}\).

3. Now, calculate how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks.
   - In 4 weeks, Claire uses \(21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}\).

4. Finally, convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - So, \(84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozen}\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7 dozen eggs."
"First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking. She spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another 1 hour on the next 2 miles. So, she has already spent 2 hours.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. To find out the total time she should take to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours, so she needs to spend 1 more hour on the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we can calculate the amount of water in the orange drink as follows:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we can calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink as follows:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks before any spillage:

\[ \text{Total water before spillage} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the mixture becomes:

\[ \text{Total volume after spillage} = 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water remains the same, so the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining mixture} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

To express this as a numerical answer:

\[ \frac{47}{3} = 15.6667 \approx 15.67 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15.67 \]"
"First, let's find out Samantha's age when Raymond had his son. Since Raymond had his son at the age of 23 and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Raymond had his son.

Years passed = Samantha's current age - Raymond's age when he had his son
Years passed = 31 - 23
Years passed = 8

Since 8 years have passed since Raymond had his son, and Samantha is now 31, we can determine the year Raymond's son was born by subtracting 8 years from Samantha's current age.

Year Raymond's son was born = Samantha's current age - Years passed
Year Raymond's son was born = 31 - 8
Year Raymond's son was born = 23

So, Raymond's son was born 8 years ago."

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price because he got a 25% discount. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Given that Kyle paid $19.50, which is 75% of the original price, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let's perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 packs * $3/pack = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6.

Now, let's add these costs together:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
$50 (total paid) - $33 (cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples) = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each type of clothing:

- Shorts: 3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50
- Pants: 3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50
- Shoes: 3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the clothing items:

Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost.
```markdown
Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To solve this, we need to find out how many servings Cynthia eats in 60 days and then determine how many cartons she needs to buy to have enough servings. Finally, we'll calculate the total cost.

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. In 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Each carton of ice cream contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00. So, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"Henry's trip is 60 miles long. He first stopped after traveling 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles before his second stop. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance he traveled before his first stop from the distance he traveled before his second stop.

So, the miles traveled between his first and second stops are 45 - 20 = 25 miles."
"First, let's find out how much the two pairs of high heels cost together. We know that one pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the other pair costs $33 * 2 = $66. So, the two pairs together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

We are told that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if the boots cost \( B \) dollars, then \( B = $99 + $5 = $104 \).

Therefore, the boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Darrell and Allen are now and then calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

Given that the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is given as 162. So we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now we can find their ages:
- Darrell's age = \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age = \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to calculate each friend's guess and then find the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding that to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses, which is 3: 240 ÷ 3 = 80.

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total time spent per day is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the total time spent in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 35 hours."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins (\( S \)) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins (\( G \)) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, to find the total points he scored, we add the points from both periods:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, the total points Mike scored are:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's find out how much one yogurt costs. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, one yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in one day, he spends 2 * $1.25 = $2.50 on yogurt.

Over 30 days, he will spend 30 * $2.50 = $75.00 on yogurt.

So, the final numerical answer is $75.00."
"First, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

Now, we know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left. To find out how much money he had initially, we add the money he spent on video games to the money he has left.

\[ \$195 \text{ (money from lego sets)} - \$160 \text{ (money spent on video games)} + \$5 \text{ (money left)} = \$40 \]

So, John initially had $40. Since he sold all his lego sets and spent all his money on video games, he doesn't have any lego sets left.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in those 3 hours and then find his average speed.

First, let's find out how long he runs each day:
- The first day he runs for 3 hours.
- The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs for 3/2 = 1.5 hours each of those days.

Now, let's calculate the total running time in hours:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total running time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

John runs a total of 60 miles in 6 hours. To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

So,
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's find out how fast Dana can walk. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this is half the speed she can run. So, we can calculate her running speed as follows:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she spends six hours in total, then:

\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:

\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:

\[ \text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 28 \]"
"If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, then Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, we calculate:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet away. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Grandma Jones had 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of pie is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26."
"First, let's find out how many calories are left for the day. If your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you have:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories left} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of the bag of chips. We know that a 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. So, the total calories in the 300g bag is:

\[ 5 \times 250 = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many servings are in the 300g bag. Since the total calories in the bag are 1250 and each serving has 250 calories, the number of servings is:

\[ \frac{1250}{250} = 5 \text{ servings} \]

This confirms that the 300g bag has 5 servings, each with 250 calories. Now, we need to find out how many servings you can have with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving has 250 calories, the number of servings you can have with 200 calories is:

\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300g, the amount of chips you can eat is:

\[ 0.8 \times 300 = 240 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's determine how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each.

Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

Now, we subtract the cost of the beeswax and wicks from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Net profit = Total revenue - Cost of beeswax and wicks
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $30.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day:**
   - On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
   - On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
     \[
     5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
     \]
   - On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
     \[
     2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**
   \[
   5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles:**
   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing 26 articles is:
     \[
     26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours."
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes and ended up with 23 post-it notes after placing one on each of 220 different cups of coffee. This means she used 220 post-it notes for the coffee cups. 

To find out how many post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package, we add the post-it notes she used to the post-it notes she had left:

\[ 220 \text{ (used)} + 23 \text{ (remaining)} = 243 \text{ post-it notes} \]

Since she started with 80 post-it notes and had 243 post-it notes in total after purchasing the new package, the number of post-it notes she purchased is:

\[ 243 - 80 = 163 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. If each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, each red tie costs:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, to find out how much John spent on ties in total, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the total amount John spent on ties is $800."
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 4 feet of wire is equal to \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.

Each piece of wire is 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[
\frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we can calculate the total number of units by multiplying these two numbers:

\[ \text{Total units} = 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4:

\[ \text{Occupied units} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his chickens per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs per day by 12.

252 eggs per day ÷ 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens per day

Next, we calculate how much money Lloyd makes from selling these eggs per day. Since he sells each dozen for $2, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.

21 dozens per day × $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week.

$42 per day × 7 days per week = $294 per week

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. He travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM).

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, Tom travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We need to find out how long it takes him to travel 30 miles back.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back. The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, we can find out how much weight is left to be removed from the toys.

\[ \text{Weight left to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy.

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To solve this, let's calculate the revenue for each day separately.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 truck tires * $60 per tire = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 car tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: 12 car tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 truck tires * $60 per tire = $0
- Total revenue on Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

Now, let's find out which day had the higher revenue and by how much.
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday."
"First, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy had. The problem states that Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the adopted kittens are 7, we can calculate the number of Patchy's kittens as follows:

\[ \text{Patchy's kittens} = 3 \times \text{adopted kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Trixie had 12 kittens. Now, we add up all the kittens:

\[ \text{Total kittens} = \text{Patchy's kittens} + \text{Trixie's kittens} + \text{adopted kittens} \]
\[ \text{Total kittens} = 21 + 12 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Total kittens} = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. If she wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, then with 28 lollipops, she can fill 28 / 2 = 14 bags."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to calculate the total cost for one visit. Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, so the total cost for one visit is:

\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many times he can spend $14 out of his total $42. We do this by dividing the total amount of money he has by the cost of one visit:

\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his $42."
"First, we need to determine the maximum weight that can be added to the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. We subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from this limit to find out how much weight the boxes can add.

\[ \text{Weight limit} - \text{Weight of driver and empty truck} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we need to find out how many boxes can be added without exceeding 1245 pounds.

\[ \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

So, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"First, let's calculate the delivery fee added to the total bill. The delivery fee is $3.00.

The tip Stephen added is $4.00.

So, the total extra fees added to the original bill are $3.00 (delivery fee) + $4.00 (tip) = $7.00.

The original bill total was $40.00. Adding the extra fees to the original bill gives us $40.00 + $7.00 = $47.00.

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after the extra fees is $47.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters and each cluster has 20 raspberries. So, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster:

\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries/cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries to the total from the clusters:

\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

So, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges in the basket: 25
- One orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

To find out how many oranges are unripe, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

So, there are 5 unripe oranges. Now, let's add the bad, unripe, and sour oranges together:
\[ 1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many oranges are good, we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ 25 - 8 = 17 \text{ good oranges} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
17"
"First, let's add up the cost of the material and the jeweler's work:
$500 (material) + $800 (jeweler) = $1300

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost of $1300:
10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Now, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost:
$1300 (total cost) + $130 (insurance) = $1430

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To solve this, we need to break down the pension calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years after she becomes entitled to the 5% of the value of the pension.

1. For the first 20 years, Marcy gets a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
2. For the next 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension, which is $50,000.

First, let's calculate the value of the pension after 20 years:
- The pension value after 20 years is still $50,000/year because it hasn't changed yet.

Next, we calculate the pension for the next 10 years:
- The pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $50,000.
- 5% of $50,000 is calculated as \( 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \).

So, for the next 10 years, Marcy will get $2,500/year.

Now, we add the two parts together to find out her annual pension after 30 years:
- The first 20 years: $50,000/year
- The next 10 years: $2,500/year

Adding these together:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the monthly cost for the first half of the year:**
   - The monthly cost is $140.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - So, the total cost for the first half of the year is \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the reduced monthly cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The company charges 10% less on the second half of the year.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \) dollars.
   - So, the reduced monthly cost is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the total cost for the second half of the year:**
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - So, the total cost for the second half of the year is \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Add the cost of the first half of the year to the cost of the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the year is \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596 dollars**."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip. Since she put in 4 gallons to fill the tank again, we can assume that the 4 gallons she put in is the amount of gas she had left after her trip.

Now, we know that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. If she had 4 gallons left after her trip, then the full tank would contain 12 gallons. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we can set up a proportion based on the miles she drove with the gas she had left.

The proportion is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = \frac{x \text{ miles}}{12 \text{ gallons}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply and then divide:
\[ 100 \times 12 = 4 \times x \]
\[ 1200 = 4x \]
\[ x = \frac{1200}{4} \]
\[ x = 300 \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's find out how long Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

He spends 2 hours watching TV. He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:

"Each school has sent:
- 5 players for the girls' team
- 5 players for the boys' team
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, each school has sent a total of \(5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12\) people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is \(12 \times 4 = 48\).

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
Number of rubies = 175 - 35
Number of rubies = 140

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 * 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280
Total number of gems = 595

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"If there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school and there are 60 girls, then the number of boys is:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

So, the total number of students is:

\[ 60 \text{ girls} + 120 \text{ boys} = 180 \text{ students} \]

If there are 5 students to every teacher, then the number of teachers is:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ students}}{5 \text{ students/teacher}} = 36 \text{ teachers} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to calculate the total amount she received from her weekly allowance and then subtract that from the total amount she has at the end.

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks, so the total allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. So, the amount she started with is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches on weekdays:**
   - There are 5 weekdays.
   - She teaches 5 classes each day.
   - Total classes on weekdays = 5 days * 5 classes/day = 25 classes.

2. **Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches on Saturday:**
   - She teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

3. **Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in one week:**
   - Total classes = Classes on weekdays + Classes on Saturday
   - Total classes = 25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes.

4. **Calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in one week:**
   - Each class has 15 students.
   - Total students = Total classes * Students per class
   - Total students = 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

5. **Calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in one week:**
   - She charges $15.00 per student.
   - Total money = Total students * Charge per student
   - Total money = 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $7,425.00."
"The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

For the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 slices of brownies.
- Each slice of brownie costs $3.
- So, the total money from brownies is \(43 \times 3 = 129\) dollars.

For the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake costs $4.
- So, the total money from cheesecakes is \(23 \times 4 = 92\) dollars.

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount Tommy raises:
- Total money = money from brownies + money from cheesecakes
- Total money = \(129 + 92 = 221\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 221 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest. Each cell phone costs $150, so for five cell phones, the cost would be:

\[ 150 \times 5 = 750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% for each cell phone. So, for five cell phones, the total interest would be:

\[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

Adding the interest to the original cost gives us the total amount Shiela needs to pay:

\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months. To find out how much she needs to pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 255 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to round each flower's price to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total earnings from selling the flowers.

First, let's round the prices:
- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 per pot = $36.00
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 per pot = $18.00
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 per pot = $34.00

Now, we add up the earnings from all the flowers:
$36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

So, the total amount Artie will make is $88.00."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: Half of Level 4, so \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
- Level 2: Half of Level 3, so \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.
- Level 1: Half of Level 2, so \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet
- Level 2: 4 square feet
- Level 3: 8 square feet
- Level 4: 16 square feet

To find the average square footage of a level, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{30}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life in the first year.

For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food every day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is:
\[ 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \]

After the first 180 days, the puppy will need 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. Since we are only considering the first year, we need to know how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. There are 365 days in a year, so the number of days left in the first year is:
\[ 365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days} \]

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will need 2 cups of dog food every day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups} \]

Now, we add the dog food used in the first 180 days and the dog food used in the remaining 185 days to get the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
\[ 180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is:
\[ \frac{550 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 5 \, \text{bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much David does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 4:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, to find out how much Raymond does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 2:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To solve this, let's first figure out the cost per flower for each package option.

For the packages of 3 flowers:
- The cost is $2.50 for 3 flowers.
- So, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 (repeating).

For the packages of 2 flowers:
- The cost is $1.00 for 2 flowers.
- So, the cost per flower is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50.

Now, we need to determine which option is cheaper for buying 18 flowers.

For the 3-flower packages:
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- The total cost would be 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

For the 2-flower packages:
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost would be 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

The cheaper option is buying the 2-flower packages, which costs $9.00 for 18 flowers.

Now, let's calculate how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price:
- The cost with the better price (2-flower packages) is $9.00.
- The cost with the worse price (3-flower packages) is $15.00.
- The savings is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"First, we need to calculate the discount amount. The original cost of grooming is $100, and the discount is 30%. To find the discount amount, we multiply $100 by 30% (or 0.30 in decimal form):

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, the discount amount is $30. Now, we subtract this discount from the original cost to find the final cost:

\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the final cost of grooming is $70."
"First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Water per girl} = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water the boy got to the total water the girls got:

\[ \text{Total water} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Total water} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Finally, to find out how much water was left, we subtract the total water given out from the original amount of water:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Water left} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stickers Charlie had initially:

\[ 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 \]

Next, we need to account for the stickers Charlie gave away and used:
- Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister.
- Charlie used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.

So, the total number of stickers Charlie used or gave away is:
\[ 9 + 28 = 37 \]

Now, we subtract the total number of stickers used or given away from the initial total:
\[ 54 - 37 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of stickers Charlie has left is:

"First, let's find out how much Alex weighs. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

So, Alex's weight is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 125 + 498 \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 623 pounds."
"First, we need to find out how many roses there are in total. Dan has 3 rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses. So, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush:

\[ 3 \text{ bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find out how many thorns there are in total. Each rose has 8 thorns, so we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won can be represented as \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is given as 22. So we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games they won is 15."
"Gene is 34 years old now and he started vacationing when he was 23, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he gets one shirt from each vacation and each shirt is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks from his first vacation. For each subsequent vacation, he adds another quilt block. Since he goes on four vacations each year, over 11 years he goes on 11 * 4 = 44 vacations. Therefore, he has 44 quilt blocks from his vacations. 

To find the total number of quilt blocks, we add the quilt blocks from his first vacation to the quilt blocks from all his vacations: 11 + 44 = 55 quilt blocks.

The final numerical answer is 55."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, let's add up all the times the alarm rang:

- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

Total times the alarm rang = \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

So, the final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's calculate Sylvie's salary after the first year of the 10% increase. Her initial salary is $600.

The increase is 10% of $600, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]

So, her salary after the first year will be:
\[ 600 + 60 = 660 \]

Next, we calculate her salary after the second year of the 10% increase. Her salary at the end of the first year is $660.

The increase is 10% of $660, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 660 = 66 \]

So, her salary after the second year will be:
\[ 660 + 66 = 726 \]

Then, we calculate her salary after the third year of the 10% increase. Her salary at the end of the second year is $726.

The increase is 10% of $726, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 726 = 72.6 \]

So, her salary after the third year will be:
\[ 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

Therefore, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be:

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( H \).
```python

"First, let's find out how many guests will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited friends don't show up, 3/4 of the invited friends will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests attending will be:
\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest. So, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"First, let's calculate how much potato salad the adults will eat. Since each adult eats 10 lbs and there are 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, let's calculate how much potato salad the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, each child eats:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]
And since there are 5 children, the total amount of potato salad for the children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and the children:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's find out how many pets Marcia has. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy and Cindy has four pets, we can calculate Marcia's pets as follows:

Marcia's pets = Cindy's pets + 2
Marcia's pets = 4 + 2
Marcia's pets = 6

Now, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So, we can calculate Jan's pets as follows:

Jan's pets = 3 * Marcia's pets
Jan's pets = 3 * 6
Jan's pets = 18

Now, to find the total number of pets the three have, we add up the pets each of them has:

Total pets = Jan's pets + Marcia's pets + Cindy's pets
Total pets = 18 + 6 + 4
Total pets = 28

"First, let's find out how long it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the information, Lee runs it in 38 seconds.

Lee used to be able to run two seconds faster than Gerald. So, if Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald used to run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how fast Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to calculate 10% of his old time and subtract it from his old time.

10% of 40 seconds is 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. The number of dogs (D) is 60.
2. The number of cats (C) is two times the number of dogs, so C = 2 * D.
3. The number of rabbits (R) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so R = (D + C) - 12.

Now, let's calculate the number of cats:

C = 2 * D
C = 2 * 60
C = 120

Next, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:

D + C = 60 + 120
D + C = 180

Now, we find the number of rabbits:

R = (D + C) - 12
R = 180 - 12
R = 168

Finally, we find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total pets = D + C + R
Total pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total pets = 348

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls there are in Grade 5.

Total students = 200
Fraction of boys = 2/5
Fraction of girls = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5

Number of boys = Total students * Fraction of boys
Number of boys = 200 * 2/5 = 80

Number of girls = Total students * Fraction of girls
Number of girls = 200 * 3/5 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, we need to find out how many girls are in the girl scout and then subtract that number from the total number of girls to find out how many are not in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = Number of girls * 2/3
Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * 2/3 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate this by multiplying Harry's sleep hours by 2/3.

Harry's sleep hours = 9
James's sleep hours = 9 * (2/3) = 6

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep hours from Harry's sleep hours.

Difference = Harry's sleep hours - James's sleep hours
Difference = 9 - 6 = 3

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine how many ounces of tomatoes Freda started with. Since her sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original tomatoes must have been twice that amount. So, the original tomatoes were:

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes make up 64 ounces. We do this by dividing the total ounces of tomatoes by the ounces per can:

\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars left on the motorway is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
- We need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes should equal the 25 cars that were left on the motorway after the 5 cars took an exit.

This can be represented by the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"First, let's calculate how many potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, we multiply 2 by 40:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Mary received 18 new potted plants from her nursery, so we add these to the 80 she already had:

\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, she will give away:

\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \]

Now, we subtract the 40 plants she will give away from the 98 she had:

\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ 58 \]"
"First, let's find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell. The second friend pressed it 1/4 times more than the first friend. The first friend pressed it 20 times, so:

\[ \text{Second friend's presses} = 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so:

\[ \text{Third friend's presses} = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

Now, we can add up all the doorbell presses:

\[ \text{Total presses} = \text{First friend's presses} + \text{Second friend's presses} + \text{Third friend's presses} + \text{Fourth friend's presses} \]
\[ \text{Total presses} = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total presses} = 175 \]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day.

John drinks water with his meals every weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he drinks water 5 times a day for 5 days.

So, for weekdays: \(5 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ glasses}\).

On weekends, he drinks water with his dinner but not before bed. There are 2 days in the weekend, so he drinks water 1 time a day for 2 days.

So, for weekends: \(1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses}\).

Now, let's add the glasses from weekdays and weekends together:

\(25 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 27 \text{ glasses}\).

So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 27."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in the 42-mile city.

The city is 42 miles across, and each segment covered by the fog bank is 3 miles. So, we divide the total length of the city by the length of each segment:

\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment. To find out how long it will take to cover all 14 segments, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover one segment:

\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total pieces in the puzzle**: 1000 pieces.

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the pieces are placed on the board.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces are placed on the board.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by mom from the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500."
"If Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, then Cody eats:

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate the inner volume of one box. The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to find the inner dimensions.

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we need to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times \text{Inner volume of one box} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 108 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the TV watching hours for each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:

1 hour (Monday) + 1 hour (Tuesday) + 0.5 hour (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 6 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the difference between the total hours watched and the hours we've accounted for is:

7 hours (total) - 6 hours (accounted) = 1 hour

This 1 hour of TV watching must have been on Wednesday, but it was a 30-minute show. So, Frankie watched 1 episode of a 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Henry meant to bake \( x \) cookies.
2. He actually baked twice as many as he meant to, so he baked \( 2x \) cookies.
3. He baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so \( 2x = x + 15 \).
4. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 15 \). This means Henry meant to bake 15 cookies.
5. Since he actually baked \( 2x \) cookies, he baked \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) cookies.
6. He then dropped 5 cookies, so he had \( 30 - 5 = 25 \) cookies left.
7. Now he has a total of 110 cookies, which means he must have added \( 110 - 25 = 85 \) cookies to the 25 he had left.

However, the question is asking for the number of cookies Henry baked last year, which is \( x = 15 \).

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback. The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon.

\[ \text{Total cost without cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cashback. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon.

\[ \text{Total cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost without cashback to find the final cost after the cashback rewards.

\[ \text{Final cost after cashback} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups each of them ate, we need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups for each of them.

For Marcell:
- He has a fruit roll-up that is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell has is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

For Beatrice:
- She has a fruit roll-up that is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice has is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Now, to find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups they each had and then divide by 2 (since there are two people).

So, the total number of fruit roll-ups they ate together is \(42 + 48 = 90\).

The average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's find out how many seconds it took Julia to row 10 feet. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, it would take her 8 seconds to row 10 feet.

Now, let's find out how many 10-foot segments are in the 64 seconds it took her to row to the shore. We do this by dividing 64 by 10:

\[ 64 \div 10 = 6.4 \]

This means Julia rowed 6 full 10-foot segments and a bit more. Since she takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we need to calculate the total water taken on for 6 full segments and the partial segment.

For 6 full segments:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ liters} \]

For the partial segment, we need to calculate how much water she takes on in the remaining 4 feet. Since she takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet, we can find out how much she takes on per foot and then for 4 feet:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \]
\[ 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \times 4 \text{ feet} = 0.8 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the water taken on for the full segments and the partial segment:
\[ 12 \text{ liters} + 0.8 \text{ liters} = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 12.8 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"Each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times a day (once for each of their lessons). Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a day is:

\[ 2 \text{ times/teacher/day} \times 4 \text{ teachers} = 8 \text{ times/day} \]

Each time the whiteboard is used, it is cleaned 3 times. So, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ times/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/time} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day} \]

The final numerical answer is 24."

"First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Jamal's phone capacity} = 6 \times \text{Brittany's phone capacity} \]

Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs:

\[ 1800 = 6 \times \text{Brittany's phone capacity} \]

To find Brittany's phone capacity, we divide both sides by 6:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we know that Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( B \). We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = 50 \times B \]

Since we already know Brittany's phone capacity is 300:

\[ 300 = 50 \times B \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 50:

\[ B = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Since the question asks for the number of ducks, and assuming each photograph shows only one duck, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- So, the total cost for these boards is \(10 \times 10 = $100\).

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- So, the total cost for these boards is \(5 \times 16 = $80\).

Now, let's add the total cost of both types of boards:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Since Sasha is selling all the leftover lumber, the total revenue from selling these boards is the same as the total cost, which is $180.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

So, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and how it applies to the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to calculate what fraction of the total 120 teaspoons is sugar.

The fraction of the total that is sugar is 7/20. So, we calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar by multiplying the total amount by this fraction:

\[ \text{Teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120 \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ \text{Teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42 \]

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

The final numerical answer is:
42"
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, so he buys a total of 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair costs $60, so the total cost is 6 * $60 = $360.

"To solve this, let's first calculate the number of vehicles that were already at the port before the second day.

There were 2 containers of imported vehicles, each having 5 vehicles inside. So, the number of vehicles from the first day is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. So, the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ total vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles from the first day} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"First, let's find out Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, we can set up the following equation to find Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]

To find Lylah's salary, we divide Adrien's salary by 1.30:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Now, we know that four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40 percent. So, we can calculate his new salary:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = \text{Adrien's salary four years ago} \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's new salary is:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:

\[ \text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's new salary} + \text{Lylah's new salary} \]

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]

\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99076.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a week.
2. Multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month.

First, we know Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the number of sheets he uses in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many fruits Kael brought.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette.

So, Kael brought:
- Twice the amount of apples: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette: \(5\) apples + \(8\) oranges = \(13\) fruits
- Kael: \(10\) apples + \(4\) oranges = \(14\) fruits

To find the total number of fruits they brought together, we add Morisette's and Kael's fruits:
- Total fruits = \(13\) (Morisette's fruits) + \(14\) (Kael's fruits) = \(27\) fruits

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
- On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
- On Wednesday, she also slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), she slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. 

First, let's find out how many hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday combined:
6 hours (Tuesday) + 4 hours (Wednesday) = 10 hours.

So, for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, she slept 10 hours + 1 hour = 11 hours per day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for the rest of the week:
11 hours/day * 3 days = 33 hours.

Finally, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday: 6 hours
Wednesday: 4 hours
Thursday: 11 hours
Friday: 11 hours
Saturday: 11 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 4 + 11 + 11 + 11 = 41 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 41 hours."
"First, let's calculate how far Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part:
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

After 3 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. She has 7 hours in total, so the remaining time is:
7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she can run at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours.

For the second part:
Distance = Speed * Time

For the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = 5 mph * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, the final numerical answer is 50 miles."
"First, let's find out how many letters Jennie stamped. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and she puts stamps on one-third of them. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20

This means Jennie stamped 20 letters. Now, we know that after stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie started stamping is:

\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, when Jennie began, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia originally had some spoons, but they were plastic and she was out of them.
2. She bought a new package of spoons.
3. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
4. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
5. After using 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

After buying the package, Julia had \( x \) spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she then had \( x + 5 \) spoons. She used 3 spoons, so she had \( x + 5 - 3 \) spoons left. According to the problem, this amount is equal to 12 spoons.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. To find the total number of sausages, we add the chicken sausages and the fish sausages together: 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.

"First, let's find out the cost of each type of fruit based on the information given:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- For 4 watermelons: \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- For 20 peppers: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- For 10 oranges: \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Finally, let's add up all these costs to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

\[180 + 300 + 400 = 880\]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes by 60 to get the hours.

Total minutes seen per day = 500 people * 24 minutes = 12000 minutes
Total hours seen per day = 12000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

Next, we calculate the total revenue from the doctors and the patients.

Revenue from doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000
Revenue from patients = 500 people * $200/person = $100000

Now, we calculate the total revenue.

Total revenue = Revenue from doctors + Revenue from patients
Total revenue = $30000 + $100000 = $130000

Since the hospital sees 500 people a day, we need to calculate the total cost for these visits.

Cost for patients = 500 people * $200/person = $100000

Finally, we calculate the profit.

Profit = Total revenue - Cost for patients
Profit = $130000 - $100000 = $30000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $30000 from these visits."
"First, let's find out how many elves quit after children vomit on them. A third of 60 elves quit, so we calculate:

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. Now we subtract these 20 elves from the original 60 to find out how many elves are left:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these 10 elves from the 40 elves that are left:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

So, the number of elves left is 30."

"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and then the luge 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets.

So, the tickets used by Pam for the roller coaster are:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

And the tickets used by Pam for the luge are:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

Adding these together, the total tickets used by Pam are:
\[ 12 \text{ tickets} + 12 \text{ tickets} = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and then the luge 2 times.

So, the tickets used by Fred for the roller coaster are:
\[ 4 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

And the tickets used by Fred for the luge are:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

Adding these together, the total tickets used by Fred are:
\[ 24 \text{ tickets} + 12 \text{ tickets} = 36 \text{ tickets} \]

Now, to find the total number of tickets used by both Pam and Fred, we add the tickets used by Pam and Fred:

"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage for Monday and Tuesday is \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles.

Given that the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked over the three days. So, the miles walked on Wednesday is \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 13 miles."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of car washes Tom gets in a year.
2. Multiply the total number of car washes by the cost of each car wash.

First, let's calculate the total number of car washes in a year. Since Tom gets 4 car washes a month, we multiply this by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we multiply the total number of car washes by the cost of each car wash, which is $15:

\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the total amount Tom pays in a year for car washes is:

\[ 720 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from that number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the unicorns are there, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of Scottish unicorns} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the subtotal:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the subtotal:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, let's add the tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark could complete in the given time for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- So, the total number of questions he could complete in 8 hours is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) questions.

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- So, the total number of questions he could complete in 6 hours is \(6 \times 5 = 30\) questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions he left incomplete for each test.

For the first test:
- The test had 75 questions.
- He completed 40 questions.
- So, the number of questions left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions.

For the second test:
- The test had 100 questions.
- He completed 30 questions.
- So, the number of questions left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions.

Now, let's find the total number of questions left incomplete for both tests combined:
- From the first test: 35 questions.
- From the second test: 70 questions.
- So, the total number of questions left incomplete is \(35 + 70 = 105\) questions.

The final numerical answer is:
105"
"First, let's set up the problem with a variable. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs and \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs. According to the problem, we have:

\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \). Now we can substitute \( B \) with 12 in the equation to find \( P \):

\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]

Now let's calculate the value of \( P \).
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"First, let's find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 700 bees in total.
- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
- There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the information given:
1. B = 2Q (twice as many baby bees as queens)
2. W = 2B (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)

We also know that:
3. W + B + Q = 700 (total number of bees)

Substituting the relationships into the total number of bees equation:
W + B + Q = 700
2B + B + Q = 700 (since W = 2B and B = 2Q)
3B + Q = 700

Now, we need to express Q in terms of B:
B = 2Q
So, Q = B/2

Substituting Q = B/2 into the equation 3B + Q = 700:
3B + B/2 = 700
Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction:
6B + B = 1400
7B = 1400
B = 1400 / 7
B = 200

Now that we know B (baby bees) is 200, we can find W (worker bees):
W = 2B
W = 2 * 200
W = 400

So, the number of worker bees is 400."
"First, let's find out how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, we multiply 2 hours by 7 days:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we know that Jordan earns $10 for every hour he works. To find out how much he would earn in a week if he worked all his video game time, we multiply the number of hours he works in a week by his hourly wage:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 140 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Adding these up:
$2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Now, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so we calculate 10% of $15:
$15 * 0.10 = $1.50

Adding the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items:
$15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The food items (milk, eggs, cups) do not have tax applied to them, so we don't add anything extra for those.

The total cost including tax for all items is $16.50."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so that's a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. So, for 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16 bottles. Each bottle of bleach costs $2, so the total cost for the bleach is 16 * $2 = $32.

The total cost for the packs of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

So, the total expenses for 8 clients are $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"First, let's find out how many pineapples John gets from his field in one harvest. Since he has 10 hectares and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest as follows:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = \text{Number of hectares} \times \text{Pineapples per hectare} \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{\text{Number of months in a year}}{\text{Months between harvests}} \]
\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, to find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:

\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = \text{Total pineapples per harvest} \times \text{Number of harvests in a year} \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 1000 \times 4 = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4000 pineapples."
"First, let's find out how many pieces were in the second lego set. Since it had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, we multiply 500 by 3:

\[ 500 \times 3 = 1500 \]

Next, let's find out how many pieces were in the third lego set. Since it had 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, we divide 500 by 4:

\[ 500 \div 4 = 125 \]

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half as many bees as left in the first 6 hours return. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods return to the hive.

Now, let's calculate the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours:

- From the first 6 hours, 30 bees left and 15 returned, so \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees are still out.
- From the next 6 hours, 60 bees left, and 15 of those returned in the last 6 hours, so \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) bees are still out.

So, in the last 6 hours, all 45 bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods return to the hive.

The final numerical answer is:
45"
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total cost of 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for 1 adult and 1 child ticket is:
$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change she received.

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 30 dollars."
"First, we need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Given that Charlie has 12 friends:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So we set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Since Dorothy has 4 friends:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to convert the distance Steve lives from the school into feet because his speed is given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Steve to bike home is:

\[ \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the distance Tim lives from the school into feet:

\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Tim to skateboard home is:

\[ \text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner (Tim) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Steve) finishes the race. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bicycles:** Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people came with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires. Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the cost for the bicycles is 10 tires * 25 cents/tire = 250 cents. Converting cents to dollars, 250 cents = $2.50.

2. **Tricycles:** Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people came with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires. The cost for the tricycles is 9 tires * 25 cents/tire = 225 cents. Converting cents to dollars, 225 cents = $2.25.

3. **Unicycle:** A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came with a unicycle, that's 1 tire * 25 cents/tire = 25 cents. Converting cents to dollars, 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up all the money she made:
$2.50 (from bicycles) + $2.25 (from tricycles) + $0.25 (from the unicycle) = $5.00.

So, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is $5.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs, and each pack has six cookies:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so to find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the $10 bill:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( 14 + 7 - 9 = 12 \) fries.
5. A raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( 12 - 8 = 4 \) fries.
7. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 3 fries.

So, the number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 14 (Dave ate) + 7 (seagull ate) + 9 (pigeons ate) + 8 (racoon ate) + 3 (after ants) = 37 fries.

The final numerical answer is 37."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day and then sum it up for the entire semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day. Each class is 1 hour long, so:
\[ 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]
Since there are 3 days (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) in a week, the total hours spent on these days in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day. Each class is 2 hours long, so:
\[ 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]
Since there are 2 days (Tuesdays and Thursdays) in a week, the total hours spent on these days in one week is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, let's add the hours spent on all days in one week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total hours spent attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 272 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

For the rolls:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

For the chocolate croissants:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

For the baguettes:
60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 2 feet = 24 inches)

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed by each type of ape in one month:

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in one month:

\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months:

\[ 700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each time he runs back and forth, he covers 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back). So, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards, and then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each time she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back). So, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 200 + 34 \times 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many starfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so Locsin caught:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]

Next, let's find out how many sea horses Locsin caught. Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]

Now, let's determine how many clownfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

Now we can calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin. Anakin caught:
\[ 10 \text{ starfish} + 6 \text{ sea horses} + 3 \text{ clownfish} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Locsin caught:
\[ 5 \text{ starfish} + 3 \text{ sea horses} + 5 \text{ clownfish} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

"First, let's find out what 20% of the original price is. The original price of a bag of marbles is $20.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 0.2 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, the price increases by $4 every two months. Now, let's calculate how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times. Each time the price increases by $4, we can calculate the new price by adding $4 to the previous price. However, we can also use the formula for compound interest to find the final price after 18 increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Increases}} \]

Here, the original price is $20, the increase rate is 20% or 0.2, and the number of increases is 18. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.2)^{18} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.2)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.2)^{18} \). We can do this step by step:

\[ (1.2)^2 = 1.44 \]
\[ (1.2)^4 = (1.44)^2 = 2.0736 \]
\[ (1.2)^8 = (2.0736)^2 = 4.299816 \]
\[ (1.2)^{16} = (4.299816)^2 = 18.5397416 \]
\[ (1.2)^{18} = (18.5397416) \times 1.2 = 22.24769008 \]

Now, we multiply this by the original price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 22.24769008 = 444.9538016 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 444.95 \]

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is:

\[ \boxed{444.95} \]"
"First, let's find out how much one red car costs. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and we know that one action figure costs $5, then 3 action figures would cost:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
So, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know that one red car costs $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total value of all the toys:
- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- Doll: $15

Adding these values together:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"First, let's calculate how much money Jackie would lose if she does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. So, the total loss would be:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jackie would make by hiring an accountant. The accountant charges $90 for the service. To find out how much more money she would have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the amount she would lose by doing her taxes herself:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$15 \]"

- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's calculate the total cost of these items:

€1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, the final numerical answer is €77."
"To make 1 Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs. For 15 Spanish flans, she would need:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets from babysitting:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much money twice the amount Ethel has is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Now, Jimmy has $2 more than this amount. So, we add $2 to the $16:

\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Jimmy has $18."
"To solve this, let's break it down:

- From Monday to Friday, Pancho walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Now, let's add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday to the miles he walks on the weekend:
- Total miles in a week = miles from Monday to Friday + miles on Saturday and Sunday
- Total miles in a week = 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, the final numerical answer is 120 miles."
"First, let's find out how much the jacket costs. Since the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, and the hat costs $25, we can calculate the jacket's cost as follows:
\[ \text{Jacket cost} = 3 \times \text{Hat cost} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pants. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Pants cost} = \frac{\text{Hat cost} + \text{Jacket cost}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hat cost} + \text{Jacket cost} + \text{Pants cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the spiders. There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs for the spiders is:
\[ 80 \times 8 = 640 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs for the insects. There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs for the insects is:
\[ 90 \times 6 = 540 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 invertebrates, and each invertebrate has 10 legs. So, the total number of legs for the invertebrates is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we add the legs from the spiders, insects, and invertebrates together:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds. Since the question mentions ""four birds at the Caboose,"" we can assume that the ages of the birds are the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo.

So, the total age is:
\[ 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 \]

The final numerical answer is:
51"
"First, let's calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than minimum = $300 * 50% = $300 * 0.5 = $150
Total payment for student loans = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than minimum = $200 * 50% = $200 * 0.5 = $100
Total payment for credit card = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than minimum = $500 * 50% = $500 * 0.5 = $250
Total payment for mortgage = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up all the payments to find out how much Jessica pays each month:
Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
Total yearly payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is $18000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel one potato and the time it takes to cut one potato.

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to multiply these times by 60.

- Total time to peel 60 potatoes: \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) minutes
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes: \(60 \times 5 = 300\) seconds

Now, we need to convert the cutting time into minutes to add it to the peeling time. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:

- Total time to cut 60 potatoes in minutes: \(300 \div 60 = 5\) minutes

Finally, we add the peeling time and the cutting time to get the total time:

- Total time: \(90 + 5 = 95\) minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 each, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

They made a profit of $25, which means the total revenue minus the total cost equals $25. Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( x \). The total revenue is then:
\[ \$10 \times x \]

The total cost for lemons and sugar is:
\[ \$3 \times x + \$2 \times x = \$5 \times x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$10x - \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost for lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \$3 \times 5 = \$15 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$15 \]"
"First, let's find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is:

240 Asians - 80 Japanese = 160 Chinese

We are told that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

160 Chinese - 60 boys = 100 girls

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the charity donation.

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent:
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Now, let's find out how much money is left after rent and car fuel:
\[ \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
\[ \text{Charity donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

Now, let's find out how much money is left after the charity donation:
\[ \text{Remaining after charity donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
\[ \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, let's find out how much money Zaid will have left after giving money to his daughter and wife:
\[ \text{Remaining money} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 350 \]"
"First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, and Bo has 40 crabs, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:

\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Next, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:

\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has:

\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then add them together.

For the first week:
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- So, his earnings for the first week = 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- So, his earnings for the second week = 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = $50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130.

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"First, let's find out how many votes the winner got. If the winner got 3/4 of the votes and the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying 80 by 3/4.

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = 80 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

Let's calculate that.
\[ 80 \times \frac{3}{4} = 60 \]

So, the winner got 60 votes. Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got would be the total votes minus the votes the winner got.

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 \]

Let's calculate that.
\[ 80 - 60 = 20 \]

So, the loser got 20 votes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( C \).

According to the problem:
- Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4C \).
- Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5C = 200 \).

First, we need to find the value of \( C \) by solving the equation \( 5C = 200 \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know \( C = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4C = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
160"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. So, two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28 years.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago. So, Mark's age two years ago was 28 / 2 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 years.

Since two years ago Mark was 19 years old, his current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years.

From point 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds less than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds less than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds less than the third). So, the total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities for both events and then compare them.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\).

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in their probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To convert this difference to a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage difference} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"If Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, then Jenna picked:

\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ apples} \]

So, together they picked:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ apples} \]

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 3 cages of rats, and the total number of rats is unknown.
3. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
4. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and the total number of hamsters is unknown.
5. There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
6. The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and rabbits is:
\[ 50 \text{ pieces} + 20 \text{ pieces} = 70 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and rabbits from the total number of pieces of straw to find out how many pieces are given to the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 70 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat gets:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the interest for each month and then add it to the principal amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, so for one month, the interest on $100 is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Since this is for 3 months, the total interest would be:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months is the principal plus the total interest:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the trader. The trader buys the wheat at $20 per bag and it costs $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22. Let's denote the number of bags as \( n \). Therefore, the total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \).

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \).

The trader made a total profit of $400. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So, we can write the equation for profit as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 400 = 30n - 22n \]
\[ 400 = 8n \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 = \$36.00 \]

Next, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66.00 \]

Now, let's find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets and food to the cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$36.00 + \$66.00 = \$102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\$102.00}{3} = \$34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of peaches John collects over 3 hours, given that he collects 2 peaches per minute.

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches he collects in 180 minutes, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the total number of peaches John collects is:

\[ 360 \text{ peaches} \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects needed for the week and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

The total amount of insects needed for the week is 3.5 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the weekly amount by 7 to find the daily amount:

\[ \text{Daily amount} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} \]

\[ \text{Daily amount} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"First, let's calculate the net increase in trees Tom gets each year. He plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase of 8 trees per year:

\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees die, we calculate 30% of 130:

\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

So, the number of trees left after 30% die is:

\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 91 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many flamingos were taken back on Saturday. The neighbors took back one third of the 18 pink flamingos, which is:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white. This means that after the neighbors took back 6 pink flamingos, the number of pink flamingos left in the yard is:

\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \]

On Sunday, they added another 18 pink flamingos to the yard. So, the total number of pink flamingos in the yard at noon on Sunday is:

\[ 12 + 18 = 30 \]

On the other hand, the number of white flamingos in the yard at noon on Sunday is the 6 flamingos that were taken back and painted white. 

Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. So, the total cost for 5 crayons is:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10 \]

Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount she prepared:

\[ \$20 - \$10 = \$10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$10 \]"
"First, let's find out how much a pen costs. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, we add the cost of the pencil and the eraser:

\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of a pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$12.00."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots, so for 40 restaurants:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount distributed from the initial amount of carrots:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

"To find out how many children there are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:
Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of Pokemon cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month**: She collected three times the number she initially had.
   \[

   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}

20 \text{ (initial)} + 60 \text{ (first month)} + 40 \text{ (second month)} + 200 \text{ (third month)} = 320 \text{ cards}
\]

So, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:
\[
\boxed{320}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Next, we need to find out how much Publisher A pays Mark per sentence. According to the problem, Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays Mark \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents per sentence.

Now, we calculate how much Publisher A pays Mark for 500 sentences:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate how much Publisher B pays Mark for 500 sentences:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we add the payments from both publishers to find out how much Mark makes in a week:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pails of water Baldur gets in a day.
2. Multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters each pail contains.

First, let's find out how many pails he gets in a day:
- In the morning, he gets 5 pails.
- In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails.
- So, in total, he gets \(5 + 6 = 11\) pails of water every day.

Next, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total number of liters of water he gets every day is:
- \(11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters}\).

So, the total number of liters of water Baldur gets every day is 55 liters."
"First, let's calculate the raise in John's salary. His current salary is $2000 a week, and the raise is 5%. 

To find 5% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.05:
\[ 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, John's salary will increase by $100 each week. 

Now, let's calculate his new weekly salary:
\[ 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we need to calculate how much he makes in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply his new weekly salary by 52:
\[ 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

John also received a one-time monetary reward of $5000. To find out his total earnings for the year, we add the one-time reward to his yearly salary:
\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114,200."
"First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and she has 10 acres, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the barrels per ton:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for the sandwiches. He ate a sandwich every day for the week, which is 7 days. Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.

\[ \text{Total slices of cheese for sandwiches} = 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for the omelets. He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich, so he used 3 slices of cheese per omelet. He made omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.

\[ \text{Total slices of cheese for omelets} = 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we know Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

\[ \text{Total slices of cheese} = \text{Total slices of cheese for sandwiches} + \text{Total slices of cheese for omelets} + \text{Slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese} \]
\[ \text{Total slices of cheese} = 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 \]

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is 31."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag contains 9 pens. So, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag contains 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has now. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens we bought, we get:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

So, the total number of pens Janet has now is:

"To solve this, we need to find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to have an average of 93. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. First, we calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440

2. Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \).

3. The average of the six test scores should be 93. The formula for the average is:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}}
   \]
   So, for an average of 93, the sum of all six scores should be:
   \[
   93 \times 6 = 558
   \]

4. Now, we can set up an equation to find \( x \):
   \[
   440 + x = 558
   \]

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 558 - 440 = 118
   \]

So, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to have an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is 118."
"First, let's calculate the distance Micheal rode in the first four weeks. He rode at least 5 times a week and each time he rode 25 kilometers.

Distance per week in the first four weeks = 5 rides/week * 25 km/ride = 125 km/week

Total distance for four weeks = 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the distance he rode in the next three weeks. He now rides 2 times a week and each time he rides 60 kilometers.

Distance per week in the next three weeks = 2 rides/week * 60 km/ride = 120 km/week

Total distance for three weeks = 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km

Now, let's add the distances from both periods to find the total distance Micheal rode.

Total distance = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km

So, the final numerical answer is 860 kilometers."
"First, we need to find out how much each candied apple weighs. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g \]

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

The total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

The total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Adding these together gives the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2600 \]"
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the cakes from each day:
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

So, the final numerical answer is 76."
"First, let's break down the information given in the question:

- Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
- Each plate costs $6000.
- We need to find the total cost of buying each cup.

Let's start by calculating the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- Half a dozen plates mean 6 plates.
- Each plate costs $6000.
- So, the total cost for 6 plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\).

According to the question, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than this total cost:
- The cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\).

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups mean \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 240:
- The cost of one cup is \(34800 \div 240 = 145\).

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.

The total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining money after babysitting.

The remaining money she needs to earn is $70 - $20 = $50.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $50. We can calculate this by dividing the remaining money by the amount she earns per mowing:

$50 / $4 = 12.5.

Since she can't mow the lawn half a time, she needs to mow the lawn 13 times to have enough money.

So, the final numerical answer is 13."
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be written as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day is the sum of the eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens. This can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, we substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can find the number of white chickens:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Now, let's check the total number of eggs:

\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The total number of eggs collected is indeed 42, confirming our solution. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, since that's the distance he walks. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, she counted 100 customers.
- On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
- By the end of the third day, the total number of customers counted was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we can subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers counted by the end of the third day.

So, the calculation is:
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = \text{Total customers by the third day} - (\text{Customers on the first day} + \text{Customers on the second day}) \]
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = 500 - (100 + 150) \]
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = 500 - 250 \]
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons.
2. Since 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, and the big pool is leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was \( 2S \) gallons.
3. In 4 minutes, the big pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons due to the leak. So, the current amount of water in the big pool is \( 2S - 16 \) gallons.
4. According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   2S - 16 = 4S
   \]
5. Solving the equation for \( S \):
   \[
   2S - 16 = 4S
   \]
   \[
   -16 = 4S - 2S
   \]
   \[
   -16 = 2S
   \]
   \[
   S = -16 / 2
   \]
   \[
   S = -8
   \]
   Since the amount of water can't be negative, we need to recheck the equation setup. The correct setup should be:
   \[
   2S - 16 = 4S
   \]
   \[
   -16 = 2S
   \]
   \[
   S = 8
   \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's confirm this by checking the big pool's current water level:
- If the small pool has 8 gallons, then 4 minutes ago it had \( 8 / 2 = 4 \) gallons.
- In 4 minutes, the big pool lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons, so it now has \( 4 - 16 = -12 \) gallons, which is not possible. This indicates an error in the interpretation of the problem's conditions. Let's recheck the setup:
- The correct interpretation should be that the big pool now has \( 4S \) gallons, and 4 minutes ago it had \( 2S \) gallons, so the current big pool's water level is \( 2S - 16 \).
- Given \( 2S - 16 = 4S \), solving again:
  \[
  2S - 16 = 4S
  \]
  \[
  -16 = 2S
  \]
  \[
  S = 8
  \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, we need to find out the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. So, the total cost is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44.00 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, to find out her remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in total. 

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's find out the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

We know Harriet is 21 years old now. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old} \]

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages together and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"First, let's find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, half of Naomi's points is:
\[ \frac{68}{2} = 34 \]
Then, Yuri scored:
\[ 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored:
\[ 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, Jojo's points can be found by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 54 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time Carmen spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both puzzles:
- Total time spent = time on crossword puzzles + time on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

So, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters.

The tank originally had 120 liters of water.
Celine used 90 liters, so the remaining water is:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Next, Celine collected rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the remaining water in the tank:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]"
"First, let's find out how many petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"First, we need to find out how much the company spent on advertising for the second year. Since they spent a third of the first year's amount on the second year, we calculate:

\[ \text{Second year's advertising cost} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000 \]

Now, to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we add the first year's cost to the second year's cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"First, let's calculate how much Carlos pays for renting the canoe. He rents it for 3 hours at $30 per hour.

Next, let's calculate how much Benji pays for renting the banana boat raft. He rents it for 5 hours at $18 per hour.

\[ \text{Benji's cost} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$18/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they pay.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Carlos's cost} + \text{Benji's cost} = \$90 + \$90 = \$180 \]

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is \$180."
"First, let's determine the number of days it takes to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. We know it takes 6 days by bus and half as many days by car. So, the number of days by car is:

\[ \text{Days by car} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Now, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, the total number of days he will travel is the sum of the days for the trip to Rochester and the return trip:

\[ \text{Total days} = 6 \text{ days (to Rochester by bus)} + 3 \text{ days (return by car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.

He originally has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards, so the number of water type cards left is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

He buys 14 more grass type cards, so the number of grass type cards becomes:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards he has after these changes:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

So:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 33 \]"

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, we add the extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract the value of the gift card from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together in one minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together in one minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons left after she took the first batch home is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. The number of watermelons left after she took the second batch home is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 21 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we add the registration cost. Each car has a registration cost of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, Kylie collects 25 * 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is half of 50, which is 25.

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs together:

50 ants + 25 bugs = 75 insects

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. Since one-third of the 36 penguins jump in, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

Next, let's find out how many penguins go inside the cave. Since another one-third of the 36 penguins go inside the cave, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

Now, let's find out how many penguins are left for sunbathing. We start with 36 penguins and subtract the 12 that went to the ocean and the 12 that went to the cave:

\[ 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"First, let's find out how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can divide Steve's daily intake by 2 to find out how much his girlfriend eats.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so his girlfriend eats:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, let's find out how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply his daily intake by 7:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Since Steve's girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day, in a week she eats:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

So, the total number of tomatoes they eat together in a week is:
\[ 42 + 21 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many vines they need to produce 63 tomatoes per week. Since one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, we need to find out the total number of pizza slices John needs. Since there are 20 friends and each friend should have 4 slices, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices per friend:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas John needs to order. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Ram starts with 25 pens. For every 5 empty pens he can make 1 new pen. So, if he has 25 pens, he can make:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

new pens. After making these 5 new pens, he will have used up 20 of his original 25 pens (since he used 5 pens to make the 5 new pens). This leaves him with 5 original pens plus the 5 new pens he made, which totals:

\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is 10."
"Johnny started with $20 and added $10 more, so he had $20 + $10 = $30. When he invested this sum and it tripled, he had $30 * 3 = $90 after a year."
"First, let's find out how old Joan is. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, and Jessa is 20 years old, Joan is:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. Since Joan is 25 years old, Mary is:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add their ages together:

\[ 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 \]

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, let's calculate how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

After students went through exit A, the remaining students are:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining students went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

Now, we can find out how many students went out through exit C by subtracting the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54 \]

To find Robert's candies, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now we know Robert has 27 candies. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now we know James has 33 candies. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books as well as their own, Dolly will read 3 books (her 2 plus Pandora's 1) and Pandora will read 3 books (her 1 plus Dolly's 2). So, together they will have read 6 books. 

The final numerical answer is 6."
"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Now, we need to calculate how long it takes Mike to write 30 pages. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so for 30 pages, it will take:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used this month.

He has a plan of 1000 minutes per month. He makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he makes 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes to his boss.

Additionally, he has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

So, the total minutes used are 450 minutes (to his boss) + 300 minutes (extra) = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the plan's total minutes to find out how many minutes Jason has left.

1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes left.

So, the final numerical answer is 250."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin ends up with 27 fries. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, let's find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:

Number of snails in the first aquarium: 4
Number of snails in the second aquarium: 32

Difference in the number of snails = Number of snails in the second aquarium - Number of snails in the first aquarium
Difference in the number of snails = 32 - 4 = 28

According to the question, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

So, we have:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, we solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie.

She needs the makeup done 4 times a week and it takes 6 hours each time, so:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/time} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30000 \]

After the movie is done, she gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30000:
\[ 10\% \times \$30000 = 0.10 \times \$30000 = \$3000 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid:
\[ \$30000 - \$3000 = \$27000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$27000 \]"
"First, we need to find the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

- Ingredients for the cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

So, Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies.

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are three people in total (Isabelle and her two parents). To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags and each bag weighs 50 pounds, so:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much 200 pounds of onions cost. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent $300."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Now, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

Next, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
\[20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies}\]

Her sister's total cookies:
\[5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies}\]

Now, let's calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Each cookie has 200 calories.

Sue's total calories:
\[46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories}\]

Her sister's total calories:
\[18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories}\]

Finally, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

\[9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories}\]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

Now, let's find out how many girls are in the first and second classes. The first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Since the total number of students in the third class is 20, and there are 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is 17."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:
\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]

\[ 52 + 18 = 70 \]
apps on his tablet. The final numerical answer is 70."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know from the problem that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals killed last night is:
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say the number of cougars killed today is \( c \). Then the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, today he killed:
\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars} \]

So, if \( c = 12 \), then the number of wolves killed today is:
\[ 3c = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves} \]

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed today:
\[ 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48 \text{ animals} \]

To find the total number of animals killed over the two days, we add the number of animals killed last night and today:
\[ 25 \text{ animals} + 48 \text{ animals} = 73 \text{ animals} \]

So, the total number of animals Rick killed is:
\[ \boxed{73} \]"
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. To find out the floor he ends up on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (which is 3) and then add 6.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 4 \times 3 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18 \]

Therefore, Bill is on the 18th floor now."
"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. If Mitchel went down the slide 30 times and Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate Anne's total as follows:

30% of 30 is calculated as:
\[ 30 \times \frac{30}{100} = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply Anne's total by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's find out how many cows are in each of the original stalls. Since there are 20 cows in each of the 10 stalls, we can calculate the total number of cows as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ cows/stall} \times 10 \text{ stalls} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, we need to find out how many cows go into each stall with the new cows:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, each of the 20 stalls has 2 cows from the new cows, plus the original 20 cows that were already in each stall. So, each stall now has:

\[ 20 \text{ original cows} + 2 \text{ new cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 22 cows, we can calculate the total number of cows in 8 stalls as follows:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 176 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Brady has in each type of coin and dollar bill.

Pennies are worth $0.01 each. So, 100 pennies are worth:
\[ 100 \times 0.01 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Nickels are worth $0.05 each. So, 40 nickels are worth:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Dimes are worth $0.10 each. So, 20 dimes are worth:
\[ 20 \times 0.10 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Dollar bills are worth $1.00 each. So, 40 dollar bills are worth:
\[ 40 \times 1.00 = 40.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the amounts:
\[ 1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to find out the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we divide the total length of the tree by the length of each section to find out how many sections there are:

\[ \text{Number of sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the tree:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Since termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, we need to find out what 70% of the total weight is (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

\[ \text{Weight after termites ate} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for the overdue books. Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books. So, the cost for the books is:

\[ 0.50 \times 8 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue, which is $2.00. So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:

\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00."
"First, let's find out how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Given Andrea's apples are 52, we can substitute that in:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Now, let's solve for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. We know Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 \]

Substituting Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bananas Andrea has. According to the problem, Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Jamal's bananas} \]

Substituting Jamal's bananas:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, let's find the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]

Substituting the values we found:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]

Adding these together:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 168 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for one cookie. Since two cups of flour make a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the flour needed per cookie by dividing 2 cups by 12 cookies:

\[ \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups per cookie} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cookies Carla is making in total. She is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we multiply the total number of cookies by the flour needed per cookie:

\[ \text{Total flour needed} = 66 \text{ cookies} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups per cookie} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup. The cup has 9,300 pennies, so we calculate two thirds of 9,300.

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 2 \times \frac{9300}{3} = 2 \times 3100 = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can find the total dollar amount by multiplying the number of pennies by $0.01:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
62
\]"
"Maddison originally has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each, so she has a total of 5 * 50 = 250 marbles. Then she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, the total number of marbles Maddison has now is 250 + 20 = 270 marbles. 

The final numerical answer is 270."
"First, let's find out how many trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees:

\[ \text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, we first calculate twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Then we add 5 to that number to find out how many trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Samantha has. Since Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, and Carmen has $100, we can calculate Samantha's money as follows:

\[ \text{Samantha's money} = \text{Carmen's money} + 25 = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Daisy has. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so we can calculate Daisy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Daisy's money} = \text{Samantha's money} + 50 = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much money all three girls have combined, we add up the amounts of money each girl has:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Carmen's money} + \text{Samantha's money} + \text{Daisy's money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

So, the total amount of money that all three girls have combined is:

\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $350,000.

Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price of $350,000.

Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, let's find the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Finally, let's find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

Difference = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget
Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 400,000 \times \frac{3}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.03 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 400,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.05 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees Mr. Tan paid.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's find out how long it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes an additional 8 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:
\[ 51 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately and then add them together.

For the newspaper ads:
- Cost per newspaper ad = $5
- Number of newspaper ads = 50
- Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
- Cost per television ad = $75
- Number of television ads = 15
- Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads:
- Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375

So, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"First, we need to find out how many golf balls there are. Since the juggler can juggle 16 balls and half of them are golf balls, we divide 16 by 2:

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

So, there are 8 golf balls. Now, we know that half of these golf balls are blue. To find out how many blue golf balls there are, we divide the number of golf balls by 2:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"First, let's find out how many M&Ms are in the second bag. Since the second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, and the first bag has 300 M&Ms, we can calculate the number of M&Ms in the second bag as follows:

\[ 300 + 12 = 312 \]

So, the second bag has 312 M&Ms.

Next, let's find out how many M&Ms are in the third bag. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. Since the first bag has 300 M&Ms, the third bag has:

\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, the third bag has 150 M&Ms.

Now, to find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags:

\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in one house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows} \]

Additionally, each house has 4 windows that are not connected to the bedrooms. So, the total number of windows in one house is:
\[ 6 \text{ windows} + 4 \text{ windows} = 10 \text{ windows} \]

Since John has 2 houses, we need to find the total number of windows in both houses:
\[ 10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows between the houses is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how much change the mother gets back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. The items and their costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

First, we add these amounts together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]
\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's find out how many stitches the collar takes. The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes:

\[ \text{Stitches for collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches} \]

Next, the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the rosette takes:

\[ \text{Stitches for rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches} \]

Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:

\[ \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. So, the stitches used for the body and the sleeves together are:

\[ \text{Stitches for body and sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, we need to divide the remaining stitches equally between the two sleeves:

\[ \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 765 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:
\[ 20 \text{ packets} \times \$40 \text{ per packet} = \$800 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the celery seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, the total cost for the celery seeds is:
\[ 80 \text{ packets} \times \$30 \text{ per packet} = \$2400 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds:
\[ \$800 + \$2400 = \$3200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part of his role.

For the solo song, Sean has to memorize all 54 lines.

For the first scene, the number of lines is twice the number of lines in the solo song. So, the first scene has:
\[ 2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines} \]

Sean's lines in the first scene are a third of the total lines in the scene:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines} \]

For the second scene, the number of lines is six more than the number of lines in the solo song. So, the second scene has:
\[ 54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines} \]

Sean's lines in the second scene are four-fifths of the total lines in the scene:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines} \]

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 \text{ (solo song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138 \text{ lines} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 138 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This means the remaining cards are:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is 9."
"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew will spend digging the small holes. He takes 3 minutes for each small hole, and he needs to dig 30 small holes.

\[ \text{Total time for small holes} = 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the large holes. He takes 10 minutes for each large hole, and he needs to dig 15 large holes.

\[ \text{Total time for large holes} = 15 \times 10 = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the total time for both small and large holes.

\[ \text{Total time} = 90 + 150 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours.

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240}{60} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"If the sum of Mico's and Marco's current ages is 20, then in 10 years, their ages will each increase by 10 years. So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

20 (current sum of their ages) + 10 (years for Mico) + 10 (years for Marco) = 40

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To find Ruby's current age, we use \( R = 6S \):
\[ R = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

To verify, in 9 years, Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) and Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \). And indeed, \( 45 = 3 \times 15 \).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. So, the total cost for the popsicles is:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. So, the total cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, we can calculate the number of spots a mamba has as follows:

\[ \text{Spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots for the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so 12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests.

Now, let's add everyone together:
12 team members + 3 coaches + 24 guests = 39 people in total.

Each pizza serves 3 people, so we need to find out how many pizzas are needed:
39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be:
13 pizzas * $15/pizza = $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza."
"First, let's calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones used in one necklace.

Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long. So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads after placing the topaz gemstones. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. So, the length left for the sterling silver beads is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find out how many sterling silver beads are needed to fill the 17 inches, we divide the remaining length by the length of one sterling silver bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week. Since they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
   - Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
   - Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
   - Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

2. Now, we need to find the total number of stories written by all three in the first week and the second week combined:
   - Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and 40 stories in the second week, so in total, she wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
   - Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and 80 stories in the second week, so in total, he wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
   - Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and 120 stories in the second week, so in total, she wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

3. Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
   - The total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot is \(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\).

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"First, we need to find out how old Ann's brother is. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Ann's brother is currently 18 years old. To find out how old her brother will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate how many cents Kelly has initially.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we can calculate the total value of the quarters as follows:
\[ 5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, we can calculate the total value of the dimes as follows:
\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

For the three rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

For the two rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Now, let's add these together to find out how many stars are in the rows with 8 and 6 stars:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. So, to find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars, we subtract the stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each of these rows has 5 stars, we divide the number of 5-star rows by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of 80 flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, we can calculate the total weight as follows:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 80 \times 75 \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that each delivery truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000}{2000} \]

Let's do the division:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's find out the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of car in the slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles. To find out the time it took, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it's covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = \text{Medals Ali has} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = \text{Medals Ali has} + \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's calculate the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

She takes a 30-minute break, so the actual time she spends working is 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10, which gives us 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, for 15 intervals, she earns 15 * $5 = $75.

So, the final numerical answer is $75."
"First, let's find out how many points each player has after the first three rounds.

Mike has 21 points.

Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has:
\[ 21 - 3 = 18 \text{ points} \]

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has:
\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ points} \]

Now, let's see if any of them get an extra point in the fourth round. The extra point is given to players who have over 20 points.

Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point:
\[ 21 + 1 = 22 \text{ points} \]

Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point:
\[ 18 \text{ points} \]

Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point:
\[ 42 + 1 = 43 \text{ points} \]

Now, let's calculate the total points for all three players after the extra points have been distributed:
\[ 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 \]

So, the total points for all three players after the extra points had been distributed is:
\[ 83 \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges. The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

So, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After the sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"First, let's calculate the number of each activity Darren does on the second day.

On the first day, he does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day, so \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups
- 10 fewer squats than on the first day, so \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total number of each activity he does in two days.

For pushups:
- First day: 100
- Second day: 120
- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)

For squats:
- First day: 50
- Second day: 40
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)

For dumbbell presses:
- First day: 20
- Second day: 40
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Now, let's add up all the activities:
- Total pushups: 220
- Total squats: 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 60

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is:
\[ 220 + 90 + 60 = 370 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 370 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much rice the household consumes in a day. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, we can calculate the daily consumption as follows:

\[ \text{Daily consumption} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} \times 5 \, \text{people} \]

\[ \text{Daily consumption} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{0.4 \, \text{kg/day}} \]

\[ \text{Number of days} = 105 \, \text{days} \]

Finally, to find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{105 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \]

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = 15 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 15 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of crates Sam sold during the week.

- He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days.
- He sold 20 crates over the weekend.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
15 crates (Tuesday) + 12 crates (Wednesday) + 18 crates (Thursday) = 45 crates.

Adding the crates sold over the weekend:
45 crates + 20 crates = 65 crates.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he actually sold from his target:
120 crates (target) - 65 crates (sold) = 55 crates.

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Increase in Bids**: Each subsequent bid increases by $50.
3. **Number of Bidders**: There are 4 people bidding in total, including Carmen.
4. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people.

Let's calculate the bids:

- **First Bid**: $200 (Carmen's initial bid)
- **Second Bid**: $200 + $50 = $250 (First other person's bid)
- **Third Bid**: $250 + $50 = $300 (Carmen's bid)
- **Fourth Bid**: $300 + $50 = $350 (Second other person's bid)
- **Fifth Bid**: $350 + $50 = $400 (Carmen's bid)
- **Sixth Bid**: $400 + $50 = $450 (Third other person's bid)
- **Seventh Bid**: $450 + $50 = $500 (Carmen's bid)
- **Eighth Bid**: $500 + $50 = $550 (Fourth other person's bid)
- **Ninth Bid**: $550 + $50 = $600 (Carmen's bid)

Carmen wins the auction with her ninth bid of $600.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{600}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year.

John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 60 miles each day. He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. There are 50 weeks in a year, so in a year he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven.

He is charged $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, the cost is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives the driver in a year.

The driver gets a $150 bonus per month, and there are 50 weeks in a year, which means there are 50/4 = 12.5 months in a year. Since we can't have half a month in this context, we'll round it to 12 months for simplicity. So, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year.

Total amount paid = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

So, the final numerical answer is $31,800."
"First, let's find out how much time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday is:
16 minutes (Monday) + 23 minutes (Sunday) = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. So, we need to calculate:
2 * 39 minutes = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final numerical answer is 78."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are folded and printed.

When you fold a piece of paper vertically, you create two sides: the left side and the right side. Each fold of the paper will give you two pages, one on the left side and one on the right side. Since the tabloid is 32 pages, we can think of it as having 16 folds (because 32 pages divided by 2 pages per fold equals 16 folds).

Each fold of the paper uses one piece of paper. Therefore, for 16 folds, you will need 16 pieces of paper.

So, the final numerical answer is:
16"
"First, let's find out how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, so:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Now, let's add the $10 she spent on rides:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

This means she spent a total of $35. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total spent from the initial amount:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

So, Annika has $15 left."
"First, let's determine how many books Elise sold this year. We know that she currently has 50 unsold books, and she sold 45 books this year. So, the total number of books sold this year is:

\[ \text{Books sold this year} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Since she sold 45 books this year, we can find out how many books she sold in the first year by doubling the number of books sold this year:

\[ \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Now, we know the total number of books sold over the three years. The total number of books sold is the sum of the books sold in the first year, the second year, and the current year:

\[ \text{Total books sold} = 90 + \text{Books sold in the second year} + 45 = 250 \]

Let's denote the number of books sold in the second year as \( x \). So we have:

\[ 90 + x + 45 = 250 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 135 + x = 250 \]
\[ x = 250 - 135 \]
\[ x = 115 \]

So, Elise sold 115 books in the second year. Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:

\[ \text{Total money earned in the second year} = 115 \times 20 = 2300 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2300 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate how many hours Watson works in a week:
- He works 10 hours a day.
- He works 5 days a week.
So, in a week, he works \(10 \times 5 = 50\) hours.

Next, calculate how much he earns in a week:
- He earns $10 per hour.
So, in a week, he earns \(50 \times 10 = $500\).

Now, add the weekly bonus:
- He gets a $300 bonus each week.
So, in a week, he earns \(500 + 300 = $800\).

Since April has 30 days, we need to find out how many weeks are in April:
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so in April, there are 4 weeks.

Now, calculate his total earnings for the month:
- He earns $800 each week.
So, in 4 weeks, he earns \(800 \times 4 = $3200\).

Therefore, the total amount of money Watson made in April if the company performed very well for the whole month is $3200."
"First, we need to find out how many people John beat. If he beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles, we calculate 80% of 20 people.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{80}{100} \times 20 = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beat.

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people. The final numerical answer is:

4"
"First, let's find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

After the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:

\[
\text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. So, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening combined:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
5
\]"
"First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Weight Joey loses per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Weight Sandy loses per week} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, but it is now sold at $11. So, the discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

This means you save $2 on one tub of ice cream. If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk would be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, to find the total savings, we add the savings from the ice cream and the savings from the milk:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount you will save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the growth of limbs over the 15 days.

- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.

First, let's calculate how many arms the person will grow:
- In 15 days, the number of times an arm grows is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) times.

Next, let's calculate how many legs the person will grow:
- In 15 days, the number of times a leg grows is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) times.

Now, we add the number of new arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = Number of new arms + Number of new legs
- Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's find out the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
5 * $100 = $500

So, the flight ticket costs:
$500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits: $600
Cost of suitcases: $150
Cost of flight ticket: $1200

Total cost = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip. So, the total amount he has to spend is:
Total amount - Amount to save = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, we subtract the total cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the total amount he has to spend:
Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount to spend - Total cost
Amount to spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day. 

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Two people eat 2 eggs each day, so:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, let's add the number of eggs consumed by both groups to find the total number of eggs consumed per day.

\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"First, let's find out how old Jane is. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn and Quinn is 30 years old, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3 years
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 years to Jane's age:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5 years
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"First, let's find out Noah's age six years ago. If Cera was 46 years old six years ago, then Noah was half that age, which is 23 years old.

Six years ago, Noah was 23 years old, so currently he is 23 + 6 = 29 years old.

Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which was 23. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 23 = 69000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, the current population of Chile is 69000 * 2 = 138000.

So, the population of Chile now is 138000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- There are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. So we can write the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator for the terms involving \( D \):
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- She invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.
- Adding these together, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, so \(8 \div 4 = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who couldn't come:

- People due to illness: 8
- People with previous commitments: 2
- Total who couldn't come: \(8 + 2 = 10\)

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

- Total people who show up: \(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. The store already had 50 marbles.
3. Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:
   - Marbles from Johanna: 20
   - Marbles from his father: 8
   - Marbles already in the store: 50
   - Total marbles: \( 20 + 8 + 50 = 78 \)

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. So, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Cost} = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost:

\[ \text{Cost} = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's find out how many girls are in the classroom. Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Next, we need to find out how many nongendered children there are. The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. So, we can calculate the number of nongendered children as follows:

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio given, which is 1:3 for electric poles to electric wires. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. According to the ratio, if the number of wires is 3 parts, then the number of poles will be 1 part.

First, we need to find out how many parts each part represents. Since 3 parts (wires) equal 45 wires, we can find the value of one part by dividing 45 by 3:

\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Now, since the number of poles is 1 part, we can find the total number of poles by multiplying the value of one part by 1:

\[ \text{Total number of poles} = 15 \times 1 = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"First, let's find out the total number of people at the beginning of the party. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that 10 people left the party. If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is:

\[ 25 - 22 = 3 \]

Since 10 people in total left the party, and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women. So, the number of women who left is:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much the magazine costs. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{\text{Cost of book}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

So, the magazine costs $2.

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1.

The final numerical answer is:
1"
"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which add up to 26 pencils. So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 26.

Now, we need to find out how many boxes Jam needs to store her pencils. Since we don't know how many pencils are in each box, we can assume that each box contains the same number of pencils. However, we don't need to know the exact number of pencils per box to solve this problem. We just need to know how many boxes are needed to store 26 pencils.

If each box can hold 1 pencil, then Jam would need 26 boxes to store all her pencils. But since we are asked to store all their pencils together, we need to consider how many boxes are needed for both Jam and Meg.

Meg has 46 pencils. So, together they have 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

If each box can hold 1 pencil, then they would need 72 boxes to store all their pencils.

So, the final numerical answer is:
72"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the cooling effect and the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream separately.

First, let's calculate the weakening due to the cooling of the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we need to determine how many ice cubes were used to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters weaker per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the weakening due to the addition of 15 milliliters of cream. Since the problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee, we add the 15 milliliters of cream to the 60 milliliters of weakening due to the ice cubes.

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records, and each person can get 1 new record for every 2 old records they bring, then the total number of new records is equal to the total number of old records brought in.

So, if 7 new records were given out, then 7 * 2 = 14 old records were brought in by the 5 people.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's find out how many junior and senior programmers there are.

We know that the total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. So, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

We also know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the payment to each senior programmer is:

\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are told that after the second bus stop, there were 20 people on the bus. So we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(14 \times 2 = 28\) lollipops.
5. After buying, he has \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
6. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops left.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"First, we need to determine how much more the phone needs to be charged to reach 100%. Since the phone is currently at 60%, it needs to be charged by 40% more.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. So, to charge 40 percentage points, it will take:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops and her mother gives her 10 more, so she has a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Then she gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

Each reward is worth $1 off their next purchase. So, they earned 4 rewards, which means they get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's see how many rewards they earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. Using the same reward system:

\[ \frac{43}{20} = 2.15 \]

Since they can only earn whole rewards, they would earn 2 rewards. This means they get $2 off their next purchase.

Now, they used their rewards from the last trip, which was $4 off. They also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars off} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount they applied:

\[ 4 \text{ (from last trip)} + 4 \text{ (from coupon)} = 8 \text{ dollars off} \]

Subtracting this discount from their current purchase:

\[ 43 - 8 = 35 \]

So, the customer paid $35 on this shopping trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year, so the gross pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30000 \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000 \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax, so the net income after property tax is:
\[ 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \]

The state tax rate on the net income after property tax is 10%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600 \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job.

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \]

So, Nick will make $8400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."
"First, let's find out how many castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins.

\[ \text{Number of ruined castles} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.4 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each
- Total installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost for Furniture United: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each
- Total installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost for Cozy Homes: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:
- Cost difference: $3,450 (Furniture United) - $3,350 (Cozy Homes) = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, let's find out the total number of paintball guns that Nick, Richard, Jason (DJ), and RJ have together.

Nick has 10 guns.
Richard has 5 guns.
DJ has 8 guns.
RJ has 1 gun.

Now, let's add these numbers together to find the total number of guns:

10 (Nick) + 5 (Richard) + 8 (DJ) + 1 (RJ) = 24 guns

Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

24 guns ÷ 4 people = 6 guns per person

So, each of them would have 6 guns if they shared them equally."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs for the suckers and the fudge separately and then add them together.

For the suckers:
- Each batch needs 30 ounces of sugar.
- For 8 batches, he needs \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces of sugar.

For the fudge:
- Each batch needs 70 ounces of sugar.
- For 1 batch, he needs 70 ounces of sugar.

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces
- Total sugar needed = 310 ounces

So, the final numerical answer is 310 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the initial value of Maria's shares. She buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To find the new price per share, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, after the first year, each share is worth $12. The total value of Maria's shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share, we calculate:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, after the second year, each share is worth $9. The total value of Maria's shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all of Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The third group, which is the smallest, will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 3x = 210 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this, let's first figure out how many cows and chickens Farmer Brown has.

Let's say the number of cows is \( C \).
Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is the sum of cows and chickens, which is \( C + 2C = 3C \).

We know the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \] chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each.

The total number of legs from the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

The total number of legs from the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added 4 balls (1 ball per week for 4 weeks). So, the total number of balls he would have is:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (added balls) = 7 balls

However, when he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left to juggle is:

7 (total balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls

Therefore, Josh starts juggling on stage with 4 balls."
"First, let's determine the weights of the other animals based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of one of each animal:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Adding these weights together:
\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds} \]

The container itself weighs 20 pounds. So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:
\[ 240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of outfits Laurel received at her baby shower. Since she received twice the amount of outfits her friend gave her, we multiply 24 by 2:

\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Next, we add the outfits her mom gave her to the total. Her mom gave her 15 outfits:

\[ 48 + 15 = 63 \]

Now, we add the outfits her friend gave her to the total:

\[ 24 + 63 = 87 \]

So, the total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is:

\[ 87 \]"
"First, let's find out how many meters Tyson runs if he follows his coach's advice. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs, which means he needs to run 1 + 1/5 = 6/5 times the distance he runs now.

Tyson currently runs 5000 meters a day. So, if he runs 6/5 times more, he runs:
\[ 5000 \times \frac{6}{5} = 5000 \times 1.2 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we need to find out how many meters he runs in a month. June has 30 days, so if he runs 6000 meters every day, the total distance he covers in June is:
\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters."
"First, let's find out how much Juice Box B and Juice Box C cost.

Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.

Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
\[ \text{Juice Box B} = \text{Juice Box A} + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
\[ \text{Juice Box C} = \text{Juice Box A} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Juice Box C} - \text{Juice Box B} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of legs from both types of tables.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables together:
\[ 160 + 150 = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag} \times 36 \text{ cookies per bag} = 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's find out how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box in a week:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, let's calculate how many cookies her husband eats in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies her son and husband eat from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the cost would be:

\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \]

Now, let's calculate the discount amount. A 40% discount means Davos pays 60% of the original price (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

To find 60% of $60, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} \times \left( \frac{60}{100} \right) \]

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 60 \times 0.60 \]

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate how much money the factory made per day when they made tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily income from selling tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, let's calculate how much money they make per day now that they make silos:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily income from selling silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

To find out what percentage more they are making now compared to when they made tractors, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Amount} - \text{Old Amount}}{\text{Old Amount}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost first and then multiply it by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

First, let's calculate the monthly cost:
- Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost for food is $25 * 4 = $100.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

So, the total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $120.

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
- Annual cost = $120 * 12 = $1440.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $1440."
"Let's break down the activities and their durations:

- Monday: Yoga class - 1 hour
- Tuesday: Cooking class - 3 times the yoga class, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday: Cheese-tasting event - 0.5 hours
- Thursday: Museum tour - half the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday: Errands - 2 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours:

1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours

So, the total number of hours for all Peyton’s after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since she needs twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, we can calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses as follows:

\[ \text{Plant pots for roses} = 2 \times \text{Plant pots for daisies} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, we add the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots needed:

\[ \text{Total plant pots needed} = \text{Plant pots for daisies} + \text{Plant pots for roses} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots before she knew how many she needed. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ \text{Plant pots left over} = \text{Plant pots bought} - \text{Total plant pots needed} = 100 - 90 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's figure out how much money Andrea had left after buying the sweater and giving some to her brother.

She started with $36.
She spent $11 on a sweater.
She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent or given away is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, to find out how much money she had left, we subtract the total amount spent or given away from the initial amount:

$36 - $15 = $21.

So, Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

We know that this 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let's denote the total time spent on all activities as \( T \). So we have:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She works 20 hours at $10 per hour, so:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$200 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She works 15 hours at $5 per hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times \$5/\text{hour} = \$75 \]

Now, let's add up all the money she has earned so far:

\[ \$80 \text{ (initial savings)} + \$200 \text{ (first job earnings)} + \$75 \text{ (second job earnings)} = \$355 \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ \$400 - \$355 = \$45 \]

So, Annabelle still needs \$45 to save for the phone."
"First, let's find the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, we can calculate the height of the second tree as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ \text{Combined height of the shortest and second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:

\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. So the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought. We add the cost of the toy cars and the cost of the teddy bears:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28, spent $17 on toys, and then his mother gave him an extra $10. So, the amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts.

- The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5.
- The cost for riding the go-karts twice is $10 x 2 = $20.

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract this total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and for Morgan herself.

- Morgan's budget is $90.
- The total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $25.

So, the remaining budget is $90 - $25 = $65.

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so we subtract this from the remaining budget to find out how much money is left for her friends.

- The remaining budget after mini-golf and go-karts is $65.
- She wants $5 in arcade tokens.

So, the money left for her friends is $65 - $5 = $60.

Since each friend gets to play one round of mini-golf and ride the go-karts twice, the cost for each friend is $5 (mini-golf) + $10 (go-karts) = $15.

To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the money left for her friends by the cost per friend.

- The money left for her friends is $60.
- The cost per friend is $15.

So, the number of friends she can invite is $60 / $15 = 4.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, the cost for 4 lollipops is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, we need to find out how much money Marisa saves each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, and she spends $1 on lollipops. So, the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \]

So, Billy spent $2 on gumballs. Since he started with $10, the total amount he spent on candy and gumballs is:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

This means Billy spent $8 on candy. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find out how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{8}{1.5} = \frac{8 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

So, Billy bought approximately 5.33 pounds of candy. Let's box the final answer:

\[ \boxed{5.33} \]"
"To solve this, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Carver's age is 45 years. According to the problem, this is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. Let's denote the son's age as \( S \).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the distance the train travels in one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip (first to third city and back) is:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles. We do this by dividing the total distance by the distance traveled per day:
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.6667 days.

Since the train can't go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train needs service every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is 27 days."
"First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed needs. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. So, the average is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that:
- A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. So, the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds is:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

And the total stuffing needed for the collie beds is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 23 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance 210 miles. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the total time for the trip, we add the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{home}} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 \]

To add these, we need a common denominator:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{62}{7} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip took approximately 8.857 hours."
"First, let's find out how many fourth-grade boys there are at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to find out how many boys were present on Friday. We know that 5 girls were absent on Friday. Since the total number of absentees is 5 girls and 4 boys, the number of boys absent is 4. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park.

To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and boys together: 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids.

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To find out the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we first need to calculate the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

On her first test, Jane scored 15 points.
On her second test, she scored 18 points.

So, the total points from the first two tests is:
15 + 18 = 33 points

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests to pass. To find out how many points she needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total points required:

42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. A total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the information, \( C = 3 \).

The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can calculate the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number:
\[ 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"First, let's find out how many points Erin has now. We know that Sara scored 8 points and Erin now has three times more points than Sara. So, we calculate Erin's current points as follows:

\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Erin scored 14 points after reaching these 24 points. This means that before scoring the 14 points, Erin had:

\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20 and there is an additional 20% cost for etching the logo. So, the total cost for each frame is:

\[ 20 + (20 \times 0.20) = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for all the picture frames is:

\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Next, we need to account for the pins. Two seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:

\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1200 \]

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[ 1200 \]"
"First, let's find out how much the DIY materials cost. If the hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 and a DIY saves 20% on the materials cost, then the materials cost is 80% of $400.

To find 80% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \]

So, the DIY materials cost $320. Since the DIY saves 20% on the materials, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper would be the original cost minus the savings on materials.

The total cost Ethan would pay is:
\[ 400 - 400 \times 0.20 = 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday Sales**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday Sales**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. So, they sold \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday Sales**: The store sold one-half the number of shoes sold on Saturday. So, they sold \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs.
4. **Returns**: Six pairs of shoes were returned, so we need to subtract these from the total sales.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pairs sold before accounting for the returns:
\[ 14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 14 \text{ (Sunday)} = 56 \text{ pairs} \]

Since 6 pairs were returned, we subtract these from the total:
\[ 56 - 6 = 50 \]

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50 pairs."
"To find out how many hours a week Hallie had dance practice, we need to add up the hours she practiced on each day.

On Tuesdays, she practiced for 1 hour.
On Thursdays, she practiced for 2 hours.
On Saturdays, she practiced for twice as long as Tuesday's practice, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add up all the hours:
1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. If 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, then 60% of the total number of pieces were functioning.

The total number of pieces of equipment is $400,000 worth, but we don't need the actual number of pieces to calculate the cost of the functioning pieces. We just need to know that 60% of the total value is the cost of the functioning pieces.

To find 60% of $400,000, we calculate:
\[ 0.60 \times 400,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary gets milk from 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

In total, she gets 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which means she made 12 bread rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils to find out how many are left:

\[ \text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining pupils like green. Since one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Finally, to find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[ \text{Pupils who like yellow} = 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"First, let's find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples she sold on Monday by dividing the total money she got by the price per apple.

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, so:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on each day:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 49 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 49."
"First, let's understand the information given:
- Lindsay has 50 socks to wash.
- She washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, 10 pairs would be 10 * 2 = 20 socks.
- She also washes 15 loose socks.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks Lindsay has washed:
- Socks from pairs: 20
- Loose socks: 15
- Total washed: 20 + 15 = 35 socks

To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
- Total socks: 50
- Socks washed: 35
- Missed socks: 50 - 35 = 15

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel originally had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies. So, Rachel had a total of:

23 + 42 = 65 cookies.

Her brother then ate 44 cookies. So, the number of cookies left for Rachel is:

65 - 44 = 21 cookies.

The final numerical answer is 21."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the monthly payment for a loan with a fixed interest rate. The formula to calculate the monthly payment (M) for a loan is:

\[ M = P \times \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount borrowed).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12).
- \( n \) is the number of payments (loan term in months).

Given:
- \( P = 3650 \) dollars
- Annual interest rate = 10%, so the monthly interest rate \( r = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \)
- \( n = 5 \) months

First, let's calculate the monthly interest rate \( r \):

\[ r = \frac{0.10}{12} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ M = 3650 \times \frac{\frac{1}{120}(1+\frac{1}{120})^5}{(1+\frac{1}{120})^5-1} \]

Let's simplify the expression inside the formula:

\[ M = 3650 \times \frac{\frac{1}{120} \left(1 + \frac{1}{120}\right)^5}{\left(1 + \frac{1}{120}\right)^5 - 1} \]

\[ M = 3650 \times \frac{\frac{1}{120} \left(\frac{121}{120}\right)^5}{\left(\frac{121}{120}\right)^5 - 1} \]

\[ M = 3650 \times \frac{\frac{1}{120} \times \frac{121^5}{120^5}}{\frac{121^5}{120^5} - 1} \]

\[ M = 3650 \times \frac{\frac{121^5}{120^6}}{\frac{121^5 - 120^6}{120^6}} \]

\[ M = 3650 \times \frac{121^5}{121^5 - 120^6} \]

Now, let's calculate the numerical value:

\[ 121^5 \approx 2.1216 \times 10^{10} \]
\[ 120^6 \approx 2.9859 \times 10^{12} \]

So,

\[ M = 3650 \times \frac{2.1216 \times 10^{10}}{2.1216 \times 10^{10} - 2.9859 \times 10^{12}} \]

\[ M = 3650 \times \frac{2.1216 \times 10^{10}}{2.1216 \times 10^{10} - 2.9859 \times 10^{12}} \]

\[ M = 3650 \times \frac{2.1216 \times 10^{10}}{2.1216 \times 10^{10} - 2.9859 \times 10^{12}} \]

\[ M = 3650 \times \frac{2.1216 \times 10^{10}}{2.1216 \times 10^{10} - 2.9859 \times 10^{12}} \]

\[ M \approx 3650 \times \frac{2.1216 \times 10^{10}}{2.1216 \times 10^{10} - 2.9859 \times 10^{12}} \]

\[ M \approx 3650 \times \frac{2.1216 \times 10^{10}}{2.1216 \times 10^{10} - 2.9859 \times 10^{12}} \]

\[ M \approx 3650 \times \frac{2.1216 \times 10^{10}}{2.1216 \times 10^{10} - 2.9859 \times 10^{12}} \]

\[ M \approx 3650 \times 0.9999 \]

\[ M \approx 3649.65 \]

So, Karan has to pay approximately $3649.65 per month."
"First, we need to calculate how far Cho hiked. Cho's speed was 14 kilometers per hour and he hiked for 8 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate how far Chloe hiked. Chloe's speed was 9 kilometers per hour and she hiked for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's calculate how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's find out the total number of pesos they have together.

Axel has:
\[ 50 \text{ silver pesos} + 80 \text{ gold pesos} = 130 \text{ pesos} \]

Anna has:
\[ 100 \text{ silver pesos} + 120 \text{ gold pesos} = 220 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the total number of pesos they have together:
\[ 130 + 220 = 350 \]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money she makes by selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we know that Millie spent $18 to buy the supplies. To find her profit, we subtract the cost of the supplies from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all the lemonade in an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.50 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to understand that he sold 3/5 of his land and was left with 2/5 of his land. If 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares, we can set up a proportion to find out the total amount of land he had initially.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( x \) hectares. According to the problem, 2/5 of \( x \) is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can write this as:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( x \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 members
Number of girls = 0.50 * 52
Number of girls = 26

Since the choir is made up of 52 members and half are girls, the other half must be boys. So, the number of boys is also 26.

Now, the choir decides to perform with just its female members. So, the number of female members is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, half of the 26 female members can't make it:

Number of female members who can't make it = 1/2 * 26
Number of female members who can't make it = 13

This means that 13 female members can't perform, so the number of female members who do perform is:

Number of female members who do perform = 26 - 13
Number of female members who do perform = 13

Then, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of female members who do perform + Number of teachers
Total number of people who sang = 13 + 3
Total number of people who sang = 16

So, the final numerical answer is 16."

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of one eraser is $2, so the cost of 6 erasers is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

The cost of one pencil is $3, so the cost of 8 pencils is:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

So, the total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, to find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu together:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivered is 88."
"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. So, David spends $30 on the ride bracelet.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and there are 9 rides. So, Dasha needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, Dasha spends 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36 on tickets.

Now, let's find out how much money David saves. Dasha spends $36 and David spends $30. So, David saves $36 - $30 = $6.

The final numerical answer is:
6"

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts for her family.
- She has 4 gifts for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts for her teachers.

So, the total number of gifts is:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Now, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have. The ratio of Betty's popsicles to Sam's popsicles is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles is 165.

First, let's add the parts of the ratio together:
5 + 6 = 11

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts.

Next, we find out how many popsicles each part represents:
165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
Betty has 5 parts, so:
5 × 15 = 75 popsicles

Sam has 6 parts, so:
6 × 15 = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract:
90 - 75 = 15

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% savings for bundling.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $10 + $10 = $20 a month.

With a 20% savings, the savings amount is 20% of $20, which is:
\[ 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, the cost after the savings is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month.

So, the total cost for streaming services is:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \]

Tim's cable package cost $60 a month. So, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's convert all the time Carol spends into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends half that much time recording it, so:
\[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's add up all the time she spends:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 120 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 90 \text{ minutes (editing)} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5} \]

So:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20\% \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of spaces available in the shelving system. Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of spaces is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in this shelving system. Let's denote the number of books Wendy wants to place as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B \) is 20 more than double the number of spaces, which is 36. So we can write:

\[ B = 2 \times 36 + 20 \]

Now, let's calculate \( B \):

\[ B = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has initially. She made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes with 15 cards each. So, the total number of cards her dad brought is:

\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Adding the cards Erica made to the cards her dad brought:

\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and received 17 cards from family and friends. So, the net change in the number of cards Erica has due to passing out and receiving cards is:

\[ -24 + 17 = -7 \]

This means Erica now has 7 fewer cards than she originally had. So, subtracting the 7 cards from the total she had after her dad brought the cards:

\[ 50 - 7 = 43 \]

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica has is:

\[ 43 \]"
"First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Bill gets \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza. Since the pizza has 12 slices, Bill gets:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Mark gets \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza. So, Mark gets:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices given away is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

The pizza originally had 12 slices. So, the number of slices left is:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Mark currently has $50 and needs $300 for the bike. So, he needs an additional $300 - $50 = $250. Since he earns $10 per day, he needs $250 / $10 = 25 days to save the additional money. Therefore, Mark has to save for 25 days.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * Number of spiders
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90
Number of millipedes = 30

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs Nancy saw. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * Number of millipedes - 12
Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12
Number of stink bugs = 60 - 12
Number of stink bugs = 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs Nancy saw by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48
Total number of bugs = 168

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"If Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, then Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, we need to find out the total number of ounces of milk John drank. Since each glass is 8 ounces and he drank 2 glasses, we multiply:

\[ 8 \text{ ounces/glass} \times 2 \text{ glasses} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of calories in 16 ounces of milk. Since there are 3 calories per ounce, we multiply:

\[ 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories John consumed is 48 calories."
"First, let's calculate how many days the builder works in a month:

He works 4 weeks a month and 6 days a week, so:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Next, let's calculate how many days he works in a year:

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

He gets paid $50 every day, so:
\[ 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 14400 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, we multiply these amounts by 4:

- Flour: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)
- Milk: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Now, we need to figure out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so for 12 cups of flour, Mark needs:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \]

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so for 4 cups of milk, Mark needs:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \]

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The final numerical answer is:
4"
"First, let's find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one day before the reduction. The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour and is used for 8 hours a day. So, the energy used per day is:

\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours/day} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \]

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, we can convert the daily energy usage to kilowatt-hours:

\[ 7200 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 7.2 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily energy usage will be:

\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times (8 - 5) \, \text{hours/day} = 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours/day} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \]

Converting this to kilowatt-hours:

\[ 2700 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 2.7 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original daily usage and the new daily usage:

\[ 7.2 \, \text{kWh/day} - 2.7 \, \text{kWh/day} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:

\[ 4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kWh} \]

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras Jane counted.

Jane has:
- 2 zebras with 17 stripes each.
- 1 zebra with 36 stripes.
- 1 zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stripes:
- For the 2 zebras with 17 stripes each: 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
- For the zebra with 36 stripes: 36 stripes.
- For the zebra with 18 stripes: 18 stripes.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stripes:
34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra.

So, the final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches.

Next, we need to find out how much meat and cheese are required for 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:

- Meat needed: \( 5 \text{ pounds} \)
- Cheese needed: \( 5 \text{ pounds} \)

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

- The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. So, for 5 pounds of meat:
  \[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00 \]

- The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. So, for 5 pounds of cheese:
  \[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

\[ \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"First, let's find out how many corns Allan originally had. We know that he has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns he originally has is:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis he has is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Now, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

So, the new number of corns he has is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 200."
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps there and back. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Let's denote the steps he took during his jog as \( x \).

According to the problem, after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that the total steps he took during his walk, the short walk with his friend, and his jog together equal 10,000 steps. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ 5000 + 1000 + x = 10000 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 6000 + x = 10000 \]
\[ x = 10000 - 6000 \]
\[ x = 4000 \]

So, Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words.
So, the total number of words in the book is \(45 \times 200 = 9000\) words.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. He reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.

The time it takes to read the book is \( \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to start reading 50 minutes before he needs to be at the airport.

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading 30 minutes before he needs to leave the airport.

Therefore, Toby will be \(50 - 30 = 20\) minutes early.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carolyn's company paid in May.

Each employee works 40 hours a week and is paid $15 per hour. So, the weekly pay for one employee is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$600/\text{week} \]

Since there were 40 employees in May, the total pay for all employees in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{employee} = \$24,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid in June. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. This means that 1/4 of the 40 employees' contracts expired, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

So, 10 employees' contracts expired in June, and the other 30 employees continued to work. The 30 employees who continued to work in June still get paid the same amount as in May, which is $600 per week. The 10 employees who lost their contracts in June did not get paid in June.

The total pay for the 30 employees who continued to work in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{employee} = \$18,000 \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June is:
\[ \$18,000 \]

Now, we add the total pay from May and June to find the total amount of money paid in the two months:
\[ \$24,000 + \$18,000 = \$42,000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ \boxed{42000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for 2 pounds, the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs $3/2 or $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. She bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of taffy: $4.50
- Cost of seashells: $1.50
- Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the money she has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00

The final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's find out how much Tim spent on the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $400 * 2 = $800. So, the total cost for the two packs is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240. So, the cost of the fireworks after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Tim also bought a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the fireworks after the discount to the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, so in 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, to find out how many dozens she needs to make for 60 cookies, we divide:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are both dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, we know that 5% of the candles are dangerous. So, we calculate 5% of 50,000:

\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

So, 2,500 candles are dangerous.

Next, we know that 5% of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. So, we calculate 5% of the 2,500 dangerous candles:

\[ 5\% \text{ of } 2,500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 2,500 = 0.05 \times 2,500 = 125 \]

So, 125 of the candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

The final numerical answer is 125."
"First, let's find out the discount price for each blouse. If the regular price is $20 and there's a 30% off sale, the discount amount for each blouse is:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$20 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$6 \]

So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$20 - \$6 \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$14 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$56 \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$56."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: half of 30, which is 15 apples.
   - From the average trees: let's call this number \( x \).

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: twice as many as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: three times as many as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Total apples gathered by Joanne:**
   \[
   30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
   \]

4. **Total apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   \[
   60 + 45 + 0 = 105
   \]

5. **Combined total apples gathered by both:**
   \[
   45 + x + 105 = 500

   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 150

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees."
"To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let's say the number of camels is \( c \) and the number of dromedaries is \( d \).

We know that:
1. Each camel and each dromedary has one head, so the total number of heads is \( c + d = 180 \).
2. Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, so the total number of humps is \( 2c + d = 304 \).

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To find the values of \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
56"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers every day, so:

\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled in the next two days. He traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

So, in the next two days, he traveled 240 kilometers. Now, let's add up the distances for the first six days:

\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} = 1040 \text{ km} \]

During the seventh day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for the seventh day is 0 km. For the eighth day, he traveled 300 kilometers. Now, let's add up the distances for the entire two-week trip:

\[ 1040 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} = 1340 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ 1340 \text{ km} \]"
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times \text{Peter's locker} \]

\[ \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 \]

\[ \text{Zack's locker} = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we know Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, we can find Timothy's locker size by:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times \text{Zack's locker} \]

\[ \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 \]

\[ \text{Timothy's locker} = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet). Oliver is at 3,000 feet. To find the comb, Oliver needs to climb the difference in elevation between his position and where the comb landed, which is 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

The final numerical answer is 3000 feet."
"First, let's find out how much money Mr. Josue got from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. So, the second bank gave him:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, let's add the money he got from both banks to the initial capital he had:

\[ 4000 + 8000 + 5000 = 17000 \]

So, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:

\[ 17000 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many cats were taken away by the boats. Four boats carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats taken away is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the original number of cats:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. So, we calculate 3/5 of the 30 cats:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

"To solve this, let's break down the cost into parts:

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month.
2. For the next 2 months (months 7 and 8), the cost is $12 per month.
3. For the remaining 8 months (months 9 to 16), the cost is $14 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- Cost for the first 6 months: 6 months * $8/month = $48
- Cost for the next 2 months: 2 months * $12/month = $24
- Cost for the last 8 months: 8 months * $14/month = $112

Adding these up gives the total cost for 2 years:

Total cost = $48 + $24 + $112 = $184

So, the final numerical answer is $184."
"First, let's find out how much the jogger jeans cost. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the jogger jeans cost:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

Now, let's find out the total cost of both jeans before the sale:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can find out how much he saved from each type of jeans. The total savings is $6, and 1/3 of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and $4 from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find out the original cost of the jogger jeans. If he saved $2 from the jogger jeans, and the jogger jeans cost $22, then the original cost of the jogger jeans was:

\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $24. Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The tattered jeans originally cost $28, and the jogger jeans originally cost $24. So, the difference is:

\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans."
"First, let's calculate the total capacity of the buses:
- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- There are 4 buses.

So, the total capacity of the buses is:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees/bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, let's calculate the total capacity of the minibusses:
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- There are 6 minibusses.

So, the total capacity of the minibusses is:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees/minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, let's calculate the total capacity of the minivans:
- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- There are 10 minivans.

So, the total capacity of the minivans is:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees/minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, let's add up the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ 570 \]"
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds, so the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. The bird feeders she made attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. Since she has 6 bird feeders, the total number of birds she can expect to see each day is 6 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 180 birds. 

The final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's find out the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so we calculate 25% of $4:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so the cake costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"First, let's determine how much money Kenny made from selling his Pokemon cards. He got $50 in spending cash after keeping 1/3 of his cards. This means he spent $50 on the ticket, so he made $50 from selling the cards.

Now, let's find out how many cards he sold. Since each card was sold for $1.5, we can calculate the number of cards sold by dividing the total money he made by the price per card:

\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{\$50}{\$1.5} = \frac{50}{1.5} = \frac{500}{15} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 33 cards. This means he sold 33 cards.

Now, we need to find out how many cards he started with. Since he kept 1/3 of his cards, the remaining 2/3 were the cards he sold. If 33 cards represent 2/3 of his collection, we can find the total number of cards he started with by setting up the following equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total number of cards} = 33 \]

To find the total number of cards, we solve for the total:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 33 \times \frac{3}{2} = 33 \times 1.5 = 49.5 \]

Since the number of cards must be a whole number, and we know he kept 1/3 of his cards, the total number of cards he started with must be 49 (since 49/3 = 16.33, which rounds to 49 when considering whole cards).

So, Kenny started with 49 cards."
"First, let's calculate how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. He was told to prepare enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs each. There were 36 guests, so half of the guests would be:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Each of these 18 guests would have 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared would be:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4."
"First, let's find out how many letters are in her sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name would be:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this number, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find out the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set cost $120.00.
- The mixing bowls cost $20.00.
- The 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 utensils cost $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The items are 20% off, so we need to calculate 20% of $165.00 and subtract it from the total cost.

20% of $165.00 is calculated as:
$165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Now, let's add up the money Dora has:
- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:
Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"First, let's find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, and Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many. So we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we calculate how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were divided equally into 5 containers, we divide 15 gallons by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container. Since each container holds 3 gallons, 1/4 of a container would be:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. He got 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost for the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, 120 cents is equal to 1.20 dollars. George spent 1.20 dollars on chips. He spent a total of 5 dollars, so the amount of money he spent on candy bars is:

\[ 5 - 1.20 = 3.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is 0.75 dollars. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.80}{0.75} = 5.0667 \]

Since George can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, George bought 5 candy bars. Let's confirm the calculation:

\[ 5 \times 0.75 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

This means he spent 3.75 dollars on candy bars, which is less than 3.80 dollars, so he indeed bought 5 candy bars and had 0.05 dollars left, which is 5 cents, which is 1% of 50 cents (or 0.50 dollars), which is 1% of 5 dollars.

So, the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

25 - 5 = 20 lollipops

He shared these equally with his four friends, so each friend received:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory cuts the cake into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they together have 2 pieces.

The weight of the pieces they have is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's find out how many oranges they have in total. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, we can calculate Bernadette's drive time as follows:

\[ \text{Bernadette's drive time} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's drive time} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, we need to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave to account for her longer drive time.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time it takes Wayne to drive from the time it takes Bernadette to drive and then add the 5 minutes she wants to arrive before Wayne:

\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Bernadette's drive time} - \text{Wayne's drive time} + 5 = 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the area of the rectangle is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can find the width by using the formula for the area of a rectangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many beads Elizabeth bought. She bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

\[ \text{Total beads Elizabeth bought} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Next, let's calculate how many beads Margareth bought. She bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Again, since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought as follows:

\[ \text{Total beads Margareth bought} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \]

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract the total number of beads Elizabeth bought from the total number of beads Margareth bought:

\[ \text{Difference} = 140 - 60 = 80 \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase from the oven is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the total temperature decrease from the window is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we add the temperature increase from the oven and subtract the temperature decrease from the window from the initial temperature of the house:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

\[ 49 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's convert all the times Jon took into minutes for easier calculation:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time Jon took:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, we calculate 10% of Jon's swim time:
\[ 10\% \text{ of 40 minutes} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes} \]
So, James's swim time is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the run time for James as \( R \) minutes. The total time James took is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:
\[ 121 + R = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 1.25 hours by 60:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 20 minutes."
"First, we need to calculate how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bails of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, we can calculate the total bails of hay as follows:

\[ \text{Total bails of hay} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, so the total amount of money he has is:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the total cost of the hay from the total amount of money he has:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total. She has 4 dozen eggs and another 2 eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs in total.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass: 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses of eggnog.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold: 10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

So, the final numerical answer is 2 trays."
"First, let's calculate Joey's new total points after scoring 26 points:

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26

Joey's new total points = 214 + 26 = 240 points

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new total points after scoring 10 points:

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10

Marcy's new total points = 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, to find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's new total points from Joey's new total points:

Joey's new total points: 240
Marcy's new total points: 235

Difference in points = 240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's find out the cost price of each sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from 17 sneakers} = 17 \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Now, let's find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, the remaining sneakers are:

\[ \text{Remaining sneakers} = 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The department store bought these 31 sneakers for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store is:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both sales:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

The total cost for the 48 sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down into parts:

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each have eight pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces/packet} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each have sixteen pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces/packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the overall number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 pieces of crayons."
"To solve this, let's break down the costs:

- Super ticket cost: $20
- Extra cost for popcorn with soda: $1
- Total cost for super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

Now, let's look at the alternative:

- Movie ticket cost: $12
- Popcorn and soda cost: $3 (soda) + regular price of popcorn (let's call this P)

You saved $2 by choosing the alternative, so:

- Cost of alternative = Cost of movie ticket + Cost of popcorn and soda
- $21 (cost of super ticket) - $2 (savings) = $12 (movie ticket) + $3 (soda) + P (popcorn)

Now, let's solve for P:

- $19 = $12 + $3 + P
- $19 = $15 + P
- P = $19 - $15
- P = $4

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4."
"First, let's find out the cost to fill one balloon on the first day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon was:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon on the first day} = \frac{\$900}{20} = \$45 \]

Two days later, the cost to fill each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times \$65 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) = 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

\[ \$11050 \]"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second part, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

Now, let's add these distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = \(\frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\).

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has 5 sapphires left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her remaining sapphires is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the value of the rubies she received. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many apples one person eats in 30 days.
2. Multiply that number by 2 because there are two people (Marin and Nancy).

First, let's calculate how many apples one person eats in 30 days:
- Marin eats 4 apples a day.
- In 30 days, Marin eats \( 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \).

Since Nancy eats the same amount as Marin, she also eats 120 apples in 30 days.

Now, let's add the apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy in 30 days:
- Total apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days = \( 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \).

So, the final numerical answer is 240 apples."
"First, we need to find out the total volume of the raised beds. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = \text{Volume of one bed} \times \text{Number of beds} = 32 \times 10 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. So, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total volume}}{\text{Volume per bag}} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the total cost for the potting soil is $1920."
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 60% more green cards than red cards, and there are 15 red cards, then the number of green cards is:

\[ \text{Green cards} = \text{Red cards} + 0.60 \times \text{Red cards} \]
\[ \text{Green cards} = 15 + 0.60 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Green cards} = 15 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Green cards} = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Yellow cards} = \text{Red cards} + \text{Green cards} \]
\[ \text{Yellow cards} = 15 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Yellow cards} = 39 \]

Now, to find the total number of cards, we add the red, green, and yellow cards together:

\[ \text{Total cards} = \text{Red cards} + \text{Green cards} + \text{Yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]
\[ \text{Total cards} = 78 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies.
3. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there. So, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, we subtract 30 from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is 45."
"First, let's find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, so the total number of puppies is:

8 + 12 = 20

Next, let's find the total number of spotted puppies. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies, so the total number of spotted puppies is:

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, let's calculate this:

\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35 \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer buys:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes at 1 pound each = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags at 12 pounds each = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales at 75 pounds each = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = Weight of sugar cubes + Weight of carrots + Weight of hay + Weight of oats
Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles in one week.

For cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- So, she earns \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents from cans each week.

For bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- So, she earns \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents from bottles each week.

Now, let's add the earnings from cans and bottles to find out how much she earns in one week:
- Total weekly earnings = Earnings from cans + Earnings from bottles
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 + 15 = 21\) cents.

To find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings in four weeks = Weekly earnings \(\times\) 4
- Total earnings in four weeks = \(21 \times 4 = 84\) cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 84 cents."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

So, Shondra has 9 plants."
"Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which is $100 / 2 = $50. Adding this to the $21 Ali originally had, Ali now has $21 + $50 = $71.

"To find out the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to calculate the tip, which is 1/5 of the pizza delivery cost.

The pizza delivery cost is $15.

To find 1/5 of $15, we perform the following calculation:
\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

So, the tip is $3.

Now, to find the total amount Ashley should give, we add the tip to the original delivery cost:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Delivery Cost} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is:

\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has by adding the basketball cards and the baseball cards together:

\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]

If her students got ten cards each, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given to the students by the number of cards each student received:

\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for the apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Becky received a $1 discount, so the final amount she paid is:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for the apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The final amount Kelly paid is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of each type of laundry item per room:

- Each room has 2 sheets.
- Each room has 1 comforter.
- Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
- Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 towels.

Now, let's add up all the laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 items.

Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of laundry items for 80 rooms is:
15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items.

So, the final numerical answer is 1200."
"First, let's calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank gains over the days mentioned:

- On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
- On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
- On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add up all the shoes he gains:
10 shoes (Monday) + 30 shoes (Wednesday) + 60 shoes (Friday) = 100 shoes.

Next, we need to account for the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday:
He gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has after all these transactions:
Initial number of shoes: 200
Shoes gained: 100
Shoes lost: 180

Total shoes = Initial shoes + Shoes gained - Shoes lost
Total shoes = 200 + 100 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So, the final number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is 120."
"First, we need to find out the total number of cupcakes Mary can make with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils the class started with. Since there are 30 students and each student had 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the shark is 10 feet long, which is:
10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
2 * 6 inches = 12 inches

Now, to find out what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 10\% \]

"To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of students at the grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home. We are also given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]
\[
x = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Jason will walk in total to break in the shoes. Since it takes 240 minutes and he has three weeks to do it, we calculate the total minutes he needs to walk as follows:

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days he will walk in three weeks. Since he walks 4 days a week, we calculate the total number of days as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the total number of days:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 60 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books each child got, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20 \]

Now that we know Sarah bought 20 books, and she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can find out how many books each child got by dividing the total number of books by the number of kids.

\[ \text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, each child got 5 books."
"To solve this, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts) and then subtract that number from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this:

- Kids allergic to dairy: 9
- Kids allergic to peanuts: 6
- Kids allergic to both: 3

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens is given by:
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens.

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find out how many aren't allergic to anything:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is 20."
"First, we need to find out how many employees there are in total. Since there are 3 groups of 200 employees each, we can calculate the total number of employees by multiplying 3 by 200.

\[ \text{Total number of employees} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tour guides there are in total. Since each of the 3 groups has 7 tour guides, we can calculate the total number of tour guides by multiplying 3 by 7.

\[ \text{Total number of tour guides} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, to find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the total number of employees to the total number of tour guides.

\[ \text{Total number of people} = \text{Total number of employees} + \text{Total number of tour guides} = 600 + 21 = 621 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since Tom and his wife each need a plane ticket, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:

"First, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of 1959 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Next, we need to find the combined weight of both pennies:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} \]

"First, let's find out how many songs Luri has on his player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times \text{Number of songs Gabriel has} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their player. Since both players can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs they already have from the maximum capacity of their player.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - \text{Number of songs Gabriel has} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ \text{Fewer songs Luri can add} = \text{Songs Gabriel can add} - \text{Songs Luri can add} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his. The final numerical answer is:

Now, we know Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total amount of oats needed per day for all horses is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/day/horse} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much oats are needed for five days:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to get 200 pounds of oats:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."

"First, we need to find out how much more money the child needs to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4.

So, the remaining amount needed is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

The child promises to save $2 every day. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity of the trays is:
24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs, so the number of eggs that won't be placed on the tray is:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's find out how much the family-size pizza costs. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, we can calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times \text{Cost of small pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, to find out how much Sally spends in all, we add the cost of the small pizza and the cost of the family-size pizza:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of small pizza} + \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts. Since each pack costs $4.00 and she's buying 2 packs, the total cost would be:
\[ 4.00 \times 2 = 8.00 \]

Now, let's apply the ""buy one get one free"" offer. This means for every pack she buys, she gets another pack for free. So, for 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack:
\[ 4.00 \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 price:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \]

So, the total cost for 2 packs of razors after the discount and coupon is $2.00. Since she is buying 2 packs, which contain 8 razors (4 razors per pack), the cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25 \]

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

So, the final numerical answer in cents is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. There are 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall and 1 cheerleader who is 60 inches tall. 

To find the average height, we add up all the heights and divide by the total number of cheerleaders:

\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} \]

\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} \]

\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{636}{10} \]

\[ \text{Average height} = 63.6 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and 1 at the top. The shortest girl is at the top, so she is 60 inches tall.

The total height of the pyramid is:

\[ \text{Total height} = 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 \]

\[ \text{Total height} = 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 \]

\[ \text{Total height} = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \text{Total height in feet} = \frac{636}{12} \]

\[ \text{Total height in feet} = 53 \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma works for 8 hours every day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes she works in a day as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. So, in one day, she walks for:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2400 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days at the office, the total minutes she has walked is:

\[ 2400 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 12000 minutes."
"First, let's determine how old Brett will be in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years he will be:

\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

According to the question, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, three times his current age is:

\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

This means that Angela will be 42 years old in four years. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract four years from her age in four years:

\[ 42 - 4 = 38 \text{ years old} \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost for each type of ride and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Over 14 days, the number of morning rides is \(14 \times 2 = 28\).
- The total cost for morning rides is \(28 \times 6 = 168\).

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Over 14 days, the number of afternoon rides is \(14 \times 2 = 28\).
- The total cost for afternoon rides is \(28 \times 2 = 56\).

Now, we add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = $168 + $56 = $224

So, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $224."
"First, let's find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add up all the oranges they brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each greek orange pie needs three oranges, so to find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To solve this, we need to set up equations for the cost at each venue and then find the number of guests where these costs are equal.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

For the first venue:
- The cost is a flat fee of $200.
- Each guest costs $5 for food.
So, the total cost at the first venue is \( 200 + 5n \).

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per guest.
- Food is included, so there's no extra cost for food.
So, the total cost at the second venue is \( 25n \).

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) where the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20n \]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. It's also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so if Bodhi found \( B \) insects, then David found \( \frac{B}{2} \). The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + B = 43 \]

Since \( D = \frac{B}{2} \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2D \) in the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ \text{Insects found by Lily} = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's find out how many yards of yarn Mariah used. Since a full skein is 364 yards and Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, we calculate:

\[ \text{Yards used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 \]

\[ \text{Yards used by Mariah} = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's find out how many yards of yarn her grandma used. Since her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, we calculate:

\[ \text{Yards used by grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 \]

\[ \text{Yards used by grandma} = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:

\[ \text{Total yards used} = 91 + 182 \]

\[ \text{Total yards used} = 273 \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought for her 5 friends.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each:
\[ 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Now, let's add the gifts for her friends:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Cherrie also decided to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise. So, we add these to the total:
\[ 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:

"First, let's find out the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:

Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 8 feet

Now, we know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we first calculate twice the width of the rug:

Twice the width of the rug = 2 * Width of the rug
Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8 feet
Twice the width of the rug = 16 feet

Then, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:

Length of the couch = Twice the width of the rug + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 18 feet

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought four packs of gum.
- Two packs were strawberry.
- One pack was grape, which cost $2.
- One pack was green apple, which cost half as much as the grape pack, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost was $7.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberry gum:

- The total cost for the packs we know is $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) = $3.
- Since the total cost was $7, the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.
- Since the two packs of strawberry gum cost $4 in total, each pack must have cost $4 / 2 = $2.

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Each 2 x 4 piece gives him 200 sticks.

\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Each 2 x 8 piece gives him 400 sticks.

\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks} \]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. The total number of sticks he can make from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 is 1200 sticks.

So, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1200."
"First, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each dog has four legs and each pair of snowshoes is for one dog, Mario needs 6 pairs of snowshoes.

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so for 6 pairs, the total cost is:

\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$72.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$72.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips each week without a pass.

She takes 2 bus trips a day and does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for the bus trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times $2.20/\text{trip} = $22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the amount she would save by buying the pass instead of paying for each trip individually is:
\[ $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This means the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

So, the total number of animals the farm and zoo have combined is 40 + 80 = 120 animals."
"First, let's find out how many onions and potatoes Rose bought in total. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. So, the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is:

\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Let's denote the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 4x = 16 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ x = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes together:

\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days Andy has until his birthday. From December 31st to July 19th, we count the days:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to July 19th is 20 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to July 19th is 20 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to July 19th is 19 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to July 19th is 19 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to July 19th is 19 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, we get:

\[ 0 + 20 + 20 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 116 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{116 \text{ days}} \approx 901.7 \text{ calories/day} \]

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of approximately 901.7 calories each day to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 per day and he worked for 7 days in a week, so his total earnings are:
\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

"First, let's calculate how much money Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 20\% \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 25\% \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs.

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, Julie has $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 canvas bags. Each pack costs $4, so the total cost is 8 * $4 = $32.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. So, the profit is $320 - $32 = $288.

The final numerical answer is $288."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of his total money to his sister. So, the amount he gives to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving half to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount he uses for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour by all four is \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

"First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row, we divide the total number of red tulips by 6:

\[ \text{Rows of red tulips} = \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rows of blue tulips. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, we divide the total number of blue tulips by 8:

\[ \text{Rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows} \]

To find the total number of rows of flowers, we add the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips together:

\[ \text{Total rows} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 9."
"First, we need to find out how much raisins Heather has for each item. Since she wants to divide the 27 cups of raisins equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide 27 by 3.

\[ \text{Raisins per item} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we divide the raisins she has for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed for one batch.

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, let's calculate the cost per day:
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Total daily cost: 14 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 per kilowatt per hour = $21

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- There are 7 days in a week
- Weekly cost: $21 per day * 7 days = $147

To find the difference between the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to know the weekly cost before adding the new device. We already know the daily cost, so we can calculate the weekly cost before:
- Weekly cost before: 12 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 per kilowatt per hour * 7 days = $126

Finally, let's find the difference:
- Difference: $147 (after) - $126 (before) = $21

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"First, let's determine how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

So, one person paints \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day. Now, if we have 5 people working together, the amount of the house they can paint in one day is:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, they would need:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \times 2 = 1 \text{ house}
\]

Since they can paint half a house in one day, to paint a whole house, it would take them:

\[
1 \text{ day}
\]

Now, we need to convert this into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take:

\[
1 \text{ day} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 24 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
24
\]"
"First, let's find out how many sofas and chairs Ophelia has. We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. According to the information given, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if we let the number of chairs Ophelia has be \( C \), then:

\[ C - 2 = 20 \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C = 22 \]

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Next, we need to find out how many sofas and chairs Jenna has. We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, if we let the number of chairs Jenna has be \( C_J \), then:

\[ C_J = 3 \times C \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, she also has 3 times as many sofas as Ophelia. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, Jenna has:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \] sofas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 60 sofas and 66 chairs. So, the total number of sofas is:

\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \]

And the total number of chairs is:

\[ 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of sofas and chairs:

\[ 80 + 88 = 168 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 168."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we first need to determine how much money he spent on the headphone set.

Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set. The CD cost $4, so the headphone set cost:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Now, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $44 left to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could buy with $44 is:
\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, including the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours if he worked out 4 hours every week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the exceptions:
- He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. This means he spent \(5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}\) on these two weeks.
- He spent 6 hours in one week.

Now, let's add these exceptions to the total:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 48 \text{ hours} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus = Initial people - people who got off + people who got on
- People on the bus = 48 - 8 + 40 = 80.

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than the number who got off, which means they get on 3/4 of the number who got off, which is \(3/4 \times 21 = 15.75\). Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 16.

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus = People after first stop - people who got off + people who got on
- People on the bus = 80 - 21 + 16 = 75.

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 75."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will be 27 in 5 years.
   - So, his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\) years.

2. **Determine his cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.
   - At that time, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - So, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) years.

3. **Determine his cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then his cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\) years.

4. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - His cousin is currently 47 years old.
   - The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\) years.

So, the final numerical answer is 25 years."
"First, let's find out how much Errol paid for the printer. Since he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:
\[ 1100 - 400 = 700 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors. We know the total cost was $2,400. So, if we let the cost of one monitor be \( x \), then the cost of two monitors is \( 2x \). The equation for the total cost is:
\[ 1100 + 700 + 2x = 2400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2x = 2400 \]

To find \( 2x \), we subtract 1800 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2x = 600 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ x = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many boys and girls went on the trip. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, we can calculate the number of boys and girls as follows:

Number of boys = Number of girls = 20 / 2 = 10

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by all the boys is:

Total seashells by boys = Number of boys * Seashells per boy = 10 * 60 = 600

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:

Total seashells by girls = Total seashells by boys + 4 * Total seashells by boys = 600 + 4 * 600 = 600 + 2400 = 3000

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

Seashells per girl = Total seashells by girls / Number of girls = 3000 / 10 = 300

So, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 300."
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's find out how old Alyana is. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 years to Alyana's age:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's calculate the thickness of each book step by step.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books together:

\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:

\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:

\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:

\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make, we can add up the vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the total she needs to make.

Vlogs made in the first week: 18
Vlogs made in the second week: 21
Vlogs made in the third week: 15

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Total vlogs needed per month = 72

Vlogs still needed = Total vlogs needed - Total vlogs made so far
Vlogs still needed = 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month."
"First, we need to calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

To find 20% of $50, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Tip} = \text{Bill} \times \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \]

So,
\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

The tip is $10. 

Now, to find out the total amount you paid, we add the tip to the original bill:
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Bill} + \text{Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, you ended up paying $60."
"First, let's find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. We do this by dividing $18 by 3.

\[ \text{Each boy's initial share} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

The eldest boy gets $6 initially. He then adds $5 to his share and another $10 the following day. So, his total amount after these additions is:

\[ 6 + 5 + 10 = 21 \]

The eldest boy then spends $8 from his total. So, his amount after spending $8 is:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. So, his final amount is:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 39 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many days are in the second half of April. April has 30 days, so the second half would be from the 16th to the 30th, which is 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. Let's assume he saves \(x\) dollars daily in the first half of the month. Therefore, in the second half, he saves \(2x\) dollars daily.

The total savings for the month should be $1125. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Total savings} = (\text{first half savings}) + (\text{second half savings}) \]

The first half of the month (15 days) would be:

\[ 15x \]

The second half of the month (15 days) would be:

\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

So, the total savings for the month would be:

\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know this total should equal $1125:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $25 daily in the first half of the month. For the second half, he needs to save twice that amount:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is $50."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples. Verna bought three apples at $1.50 each, so the cost for the apples is:
\[ 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges. Verna bought five oranges at $0.80 each, so the cost for the oranges is:
\[ 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches. Verna bought six peaches at $0.75 each, so the cost for the peaches is:
\[ 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the fruits by adding the costs together:
\[ 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00 \]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
\[ 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus gets for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny gets for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have to divide is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total distance Jeff walks in one day and then multiply that by the number of days he works in a week.

Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day. So, in one day, he walks:
3 miles (to work) + 3 miles (back home) = 6 miles

Since he works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is:
6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

So, the final numerical answer is 30 miles."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The alphabet has 26 letters.
2. Elise writes the alphabet twice in full. So, for the first two full alphabets, she writes:
   \[
   26 \times 2 = 52 \text{ letters}
   \]
3. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 13 letters, so she writes:
   \[
   13 \text{ letters}
   \]
4. After that, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters she wrote in the first two full alphabets and the 13 letters she wrote as half of the alphabet. So, she writes:
   \[
   52 + 13 = 65 \text{ letters}
   \]
5. Adding all these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
   \[
   52 + 13 + 65 = 130
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 130."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

- In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
- In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so that's 3 families * 3 = 9 new families.
- In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so that's 9 families * 3 = 27 new families.
- In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so that's 27 families * 3 = 81 new families.

So, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified."
"Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so he lost a total of 10 * 3 = 30 pounds during his illness.

If his final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight. So, his initial weight was 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.

The final numerical answer is 100 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many toys James's play set would have if it were five times larger. James's play set has 80 toys, so five times that would be:

\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. So, Jonathan needs 400 toys to have a play set five times larger than James's. If he needs 2 more toys to reach 400, then he currently has:

\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ toys} \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy without the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12: \(12\)
- One geometry set at $10: \(10\)

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $20:
\[10\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.10 \times 20 = 2\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Daniel has to spend:
\[20 - 2 = 18\]

So, Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hamburgers:
- Carly orders 5 hamburgers at $4 each.
- So, the cost for hamburgers is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the potato fries:
- Carly orders 10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack.
- So, the cost for potato fries is \(10 \times 0.30 = 3\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the fruit drinks:
- Carly orders 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can.
- So, the cost for fruit drinks is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of hamburgers + cost of potato fries + cost of fruit drinks
- Total cost = \(20 + 3 + 10 = 33\) dollars.

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she gets back is:
- Change = fifty dollars - total cost
- Change = \(50 - 33 = 17\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 17."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, the commission is 30%.
2. For the amount over $1000 (which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500), the commission is an additional 10% on top of the 30%.

Let's calculate each part:

1. Commission on the first $1000:
\[ 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

2. Commission on the amount over $1000:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

Now, we add these two amounts to find the total commission:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, Antonella earned $450 from selling goods worth $2500."
"First, let's calculate how many bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he currently has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles he needs for his 70 guests. He wants to have 2 bottles per guest, so:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 bottles

So, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes in cold water. So, we calculate twice the cold time and then add 2 minutes:

\[ \text{Warm time} = 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water conditions.

For cold water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles} = 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we subtract the cold time from the warm time:

\[ \text{Difference} = 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's find out how much he earns in a week. He works 4 days a week, so:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, we need to find out how much the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * Cost of foot-long fish sub
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $120

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

So, the final numerical answer is $160."
"First, we need to find out how many buttons had four holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 of them had two holes, we subtract the 7 from the total:

21 - 7 = 14 buttons had four holes.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with two holes:

7 buttons * 2 holes per button = 14 holes.

Then, we calculate the total number of holes for the buttons with four holes:

14 buttons * 4 holes per button = 56 holes.

Finally, we add the two totals together to find the total number of holes in all the buttons:

14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, and Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size as follows:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we need to find out how big Peter's locker is. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, but we can denote it as \( R \). Octavia drinks half of this amount, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from the current amount:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can't calculate a specific numerical answer. However, the expression \( 5R - 4 \) represents the reduction in cups Juan must make. If we assume \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, then the reduction Juan must make is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

If we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee \( R \) is 8 (a common daily recommendation), then:

\[ 5 \times 8 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups. But since the problem doesn't specify \( R \), the general answer is:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

If we assume \( R = 8 \) for simplicity, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

First, we calculate the total number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Total number of hamsters + Total number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we subtract 20 from Mark's weight:

Mark's weight = 150 pounds
Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Now, let's find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we multiply Susan's weight by 2:

Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now we have the weights of all three friends:
- Mark weighs 150 pounds
- Susan weighs 130 pounds
- Bob weighs 260 pounds

To find the average weight, we add up their weights and divide by the number of friends:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

So, the final numerical answer is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the angle of the sun changes over time and how it relates to the angle from the ground.

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees upward from the pyramid every hour.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

First, we calculate the total upward movement of the sun over 10 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

This means the sun moves 50 degrees upward from its initial position. Since the initial angle from the ground is 32 degrees, the new angle from the ground will be:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 82 \]"
"First, let's find out the ages of James's sons. If one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, then the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, James needs candles for both sons. So, he needs 12 candles for the 12-year-old son and 8 candles for the 8-year-old son. In total, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles."
"To solve this, let's first calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week.

She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate how many pages she read in the first week by multiplying the number of minutes she read by the number of pages she reads per minute:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

So, in the first week, she read 140 pages. Adding the 100 pages she read in the second week, we get:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 240 \text{ pages} \]"
"First, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Sandwiches Cody ate} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Sandwiches Trevor ate} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, let's find out the total number of sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor:

\[
\text{Total sandwiches eaten} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, to find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches:

\[
\text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
5
\]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old.
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
3. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \( x \), then we have the equation:
   \[
   51 = 3x
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{51}{3} = 17
   \]
   So, in 7 years, the nephew will be 17 years old.
5. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 years from 17:
   \[
   17 - 7 = 10
   \]

Therefore, the nephew is 10 years old today.

The final numerical answer is 10."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each.
3. For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of $1.00, which is $0.50 each.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sharon received:

- For the first tooth: $5.00
- For the next three teeth: $1.00 * 3 = $3.00
- For the last two teeth: $0.50 * 2 = $1.00

Adding these amounts together:

$5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, to find out how many goals all three teenagers scored in total, we add up the goals scored by each:

- Richie: 80 goals
- Mark: 60 goals
- Anna: 35 goals

Total goals scored by all three = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals.

So, the final numerical answer is 175."
"First, let's calculate how much Mitchell made. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He buys one wooden action figure each day, and each costs $5.

Number of wooden action figures bought = 4 (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday)
Total cost for wooden action figures = 4 * $5 = $20

Now, let's find out how much money Peter has left after buying the wooden action figures.

Money left after buying wooden action figures = $70 - $20 = $50

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2.

Number of plastic action figures he can buy = $50 / $2 = 25

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week.

Total number of action figures = Number of wooden action figures + Number of plastic action figures
Total number of action figures = 4 + 25 = 29

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 29."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the spaying procedure:
- Spaying cost: $200

- Spaying cost: $200
- Vaccines cost: $60
- Vase repair cost: $48
- Total cost: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308

So, the total cost for Leah's kitten so far is $308."
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses per week, but the flower shops order 65 roses per week. This means Ford lacks:
65 - 40 = 25 roses per week.

To find out how many roses he lacks in a month, we need to know how many weeks are in a month. For simplicity, let's assume a month has 4 weeks.

So, the total number of roses Ford lacks in a month is:
25 roses/week * 4 weeks = 100 roses.

The final numerical answer is 100 roses."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how much money Katina will have left in her account after 2 years if she removes $100 every month.

First, let's find out how many months are in 2 years:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money she removes over 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times $100/\text{month} = $2400 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings:
\[ $3000 - $2400 = $600 \]

So, the amount of money remaining in her account after 2 years is:
\[ $600 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the bread and cheese for 10 sandwiches.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and since 10 sandwiches are made from 1 loaf, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Bread} + \text{Cost of Cheese and Condiments} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each.

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Price per Sandwich} \times \text{Number of Sandwiches Sold} \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$7.00 \times 10 = \$70.00 \]

Now, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

\[ \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00 \]

So, the net profit is \$37.00."

"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
- The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.
- Area = length × width = 18 feet × 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
- The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.
- The padding costs $2 per square foot.
- Total cost for new carpet and padding = (12 + 2) × 216 = 14 × 216 = $3024.

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
- The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet.
- Cost to remove the old carpet = 4 × 216 = $864.

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
- The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.
- Cost to install the new carpet = 34 × 216 = $7344.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost of new carpet and padding = $3024.
- Cost to remove the old carpet = $864.
- Cost to install the new carpet = $7344.
- Total cost = $3024 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11232."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to first calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Let's add up the birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds seen = 50 (Day 1) + 50 (Day 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Day 4) + 120 (Day 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7)

Now, let's add these numbers:
50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 450 birds

Mack counted birds over 7 days, so we divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average:
Average = Total birds / Number of days
Average = 450 / 7

Now, let's calculate the average:
Average = 64.28571428571429

Rounding to two decimal places, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is approximately 64.29."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. So, let's denote this starting value as \( S = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.
   - Half of the starting value is \( \frac{S}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - Adding this to the starting value gives \( S + \frac{S}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - Dividing this result by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).

3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.
   - The starting value minus 12 is \( S - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   - Multiplying the result from the first operation by this value gives \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To solve this, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage difference is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we know the oven is off by 4% for any temperature setting. We need to find the temperature setting that will give us 520 degrees when the oven is off by 4%.

Let's denote the correct temperature setting as \( T \).

The relationship between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = \text{Set Temperature} + \text{Percentage Difference} \times \text{Set Temperature} \]

Plugging in the values we know:
\[ 468 = T + 0.04T \]
\[ 468 = 1.04T \]

Now, solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{468}{1.04} \]
\[ T = 450 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 450 degrees to get the actual temperature as per her recipe that calls for 520 degrees. However, since the recipe calls for 520 degrees and the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the temperature that would give us 520 degrees when the oven is off by 4%.

Let's denote the temperature she should set as \( T' \).

\[ 520 = T' + 0.04T' \]
\[ 520 = 1.04T' \]

Now, solve for \( T' \):
\[ T' = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ T' = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to get the actual temperature as per her recipe that calls for 520 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1 hour and 30 minutes is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, 2 hours and 5 minutes is:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"First, we need to find out how much Juan's house is worth. If Herb's house is worth $76,000 and Juan's house is 30% less expensive, we can calculate the value of Juan's house by finding 30% of $76,000 and subtracting that from $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is worth:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of both houses, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's determine how many cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen means 12, she bought 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Judy's friend also brought 20 more dishes than cups. Since her friend brought 40 cups, she brought \(40 + 20 = 60\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes, so the total number of cups and dishes she brought is \(12 + 24 = 36\).

Her friend brought 40 cups and 60 dishes, so the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

The total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is \(36 + 100 = 136\).

So, the final numerical answer is 136."
"First, let's calculate the discount on one box of contacts. If the original price of one box is $100.00 and there is a 10% discount, the discount amount is:

\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:

\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for the 2 boxes is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of contacts Pete gets with 2 boxes. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs Pete gets is:

\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

Finally, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is $2.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earned.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of:
2 + 1 = 3 hours

Since she was paid $10 an hour, her total earnings are:
3 hours * $10/hour = $30

Now, let's calculate how much John earned.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked:
2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked:
3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday

So, John worked a total of:
4 + 3 = 7 hours

Since he was also paid $10 an hour, his total earnings are:
7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
$70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah.

For aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- So, the total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- So, the total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Now, we need to find out how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks (1600 / 200) * 100 ml.

Let's calculate that:
- (1600 / 200) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's find out Jared's typing speed after the second increase. He started at 47 WPM and increased it by 5 words to 52 WPM. If he increases it by another 5 words, his new speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, to find the average of the three measurements, we add the three speeds together and then divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum of the speeds:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Now, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"First, let's calculate how much Martin will lose in 5 weeks if he eats Cheerios every day for breakfast. We know he loses 1.25 pounds per week.

\[ \text{Weight loss with Cheerios} = 1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} \]

\[ \text{Weight loss with Cheerios} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Martin will gain in 5 weeks if he eats donuts every day for breakfast. We know he gains 1.75 pounds per week.

\[ \text{Weight gain with donuts} = 1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} \]

\[ \text{Weight gain with donuts} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we subtract the weight loss with Cheerios from the weight gain with donuts.

\[ \text{Difference in weight} = \text{Weight gain with donuts} - \text{Weight loss with Cheerios} \]

\[ \text{Difference in weight} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} - 6.25 \, \text{pounds} \]

\[ \text{Difference in weight} = 2.5 \, \text{pounds} \]

So, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 2.5 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of people Alex will have based on the initial invitations.

Alex invites 100 people. Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends. So, the number of friends invited is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends and 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses. So, the number of people bringing spouses is 8.

Now, let's add up all the people Alex will have:
- Initial 100 people
- 200 friends invited by the initial 100 people
- 8 people bringing spouses

So, the total number of people is:
\[ 100 + 200 + 8 = 308 \]

Therefore, Alex will need 308 seats."
"First, let's find out how much the Dachshund weighs. Since the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, and the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, the Dachshund weighs:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we find out how much the Papillon weighs. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we find out how much the Mastiff weighs. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ 5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon.com.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay.

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, so it's 2 * $4 = $8.
So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay.

The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, starting from 4 feet and doubling in height each day.

Let's list the height of the beanstalk each day:

- Day 0 (starting point): 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

We can see that on Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet Mark's window is off the ground.

So, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, determine how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein in 200 grams by doubling the protein content:
   \[
   \text{Protein in 200 grams} = 3 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total protein John gets in a week. Since he eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, in a week (7 days) he will eat:
   \[
   \text{Total protein in a week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:
13"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy with the quarters. Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is 5 cents, we need to convert the quarters into cents. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 8 quarters are worth:

\[ 8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's see how many gumballs he can buy with 200 cents. Since each gumball costs 5 cents, the number of gumballs he can buy with 200 cents is:

\[ \frac{200}{5} = 40 \text{ gumballs} \]

Next, let's see how many gumballs he can buy with the dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 6 dimes are worth:

\[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents} \]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, the number of gumballs he can buy with 60 cents is:

\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \text{ gumballs} \]

Now, let's see how many gumballs he can buy with the nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 14 nickels are worth:

\[ 14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ cents} \]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, the number of gumballs he can buy with 70 cents is:

\[ \frac{70}{5} = 14 \text{ gumballs} \]

Finally, let's see how many gumballs he can buy with the pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so 15 pennies are worth:

\[ 15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, the number of gumballs he can buy with 15 cents is:

\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ gumballs} \]

Now, we add up all the gumballs he can buy with the quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies:

\[ 40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69 \text{ gumballs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 69 \]"
"To solve this, let's count the legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: Each dog has 4 legs. With 5 dogs, that's 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
- Cats: Each cat has 4 legs. With 2 cats, that's 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
- Birds: Each bird has 2 legs. With 10 birds, that's 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add up all the legs:
20 (from dogs) + 8 (from cats) + 20 (from birds) = 48 legs in total.

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"First, we need to find out what 50% of the original 8-pound weight is. To do this, we calculate:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 8 = \frac{50}{100} \times 8 = 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \]

So, Jamaal increases the weight by 4 pounds. Adding this to the original 8-pound weight gives:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Now, Jamaal uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than the increased weight. So, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem year by year.

**First Year:**
- Steve starts with 5 games.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months.
- So, he buys 12 games in the first year.
- Total games after the first year = 5 (initial) + 12 (bought) = 17 games.

**Second Year:**
- He starts the year with 17 games.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months.
- So, he buys 24 games in the second year.
- Total games after the second year = 17 (from the first year) + 24 (bought) = 41 games.

**Third Year:**
- He starts the year with 41 games.
- He buys 4 games per month for 12 months.
- So, he buys 48 games in the third year.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after the third year = 41 (from the second year) + 48 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 94 games.

So, the final number of games Steve has after 3 years is 94."
"First, we need to find the speed of the plane. Speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time. So, the plane's speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is:

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2 to find out how much he makes in one hour:

\[ \text{Ruiz's production per hour} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's production per hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's production per hour} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in one hour. We add Ruiz's and Marissa's production per hour:

\[ \text{Total production per hour} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} + 45 \text{ pounds per hour} = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

They worked for 12 hours in a day, so we multiply their total production per hour by 12 to find the total amount of chocolate they made together in a day:

\[ \text{Total production in a day} = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in a day is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Howard spends each day.

On Monday, he spends $8.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

He originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from his original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Patrick earned in the first four hours.

He sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, the earnings per hour are:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50/\text{hour} \]

For four hours, his total earnings are:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the next two hours.

He sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, the earnings per hour are:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00/\text{hour} \]

For two hours, his total earnings are:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00/\text{hour} = \$12.00 \]

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings for the six hours:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[ \$42.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how many times the tires rotate in total for Jeremy's monthly driving.

The car rotates its tires 725 times for every 2 miles. So, for 400 miles, the tires rotate:

\[ \text{Rotations per 2 miles} = 725 \]
\[ \text{Miles driven} = 400 \]
\[ \text{Rotations for 400 miles} = \frac{725}{2} \times 400 \]

Let's calculate that:

\[ \text{Rotations for 400 miles} = 362.5 \times 400 = 145,000 \]

So, the tires rotate 145,000 times in a month.

Next, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:

\[ \text{Total rotations} = 10,440,000 \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 145,000 \]
\[ \text{Months needed} = \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} \]

Let's calculate that:

\[ \text{Months needed} = \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} = 72 \]

So, it will take 72 months for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

Finally, we need to convert months into years:

\[ \text{Months in a year} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years."
"First, we need to find out how many times Jackie can get 120 washings out of 1 pump. Since the directions say 1 pump gives 120 washings, we can use 1 pump for 120 washings.

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are needed for 120 washings. Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will need 120 pumps for 120 washings.

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00, and we need to find out how much each pump costs. To do this, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps.

So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\$24.00}{120 \text{ pumps}} \]

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \$0.20 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:
\[ \$0.20 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is 20 cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the discount on the shorts. The shorts originally cost $35 and there is a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the shorts will cost:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a day.
   Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day.

2. Determine how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
   Since there are 7 days in a week, Juan will make \(4 \times 7 = 28\) dozen croissants in a week.

3. Determine how much butter is needed for 28 dozen croissants.
   We know that 1 dozen croissants require \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter.
   So, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is \( 28 \times \frac{1}{4} \) pounds.

4. Calculate the total amount of butter needed.
   \( 28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7 \) pounds.

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants in a week.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. The cost is $194 per meter and her street is 150 meters long.

\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 194 \times 150 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 194 \times 150 = 29100 \]

So, it costs $29,100 to repave Monica's street.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 194 \times 490 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 194 \times 490 = 94860 \]

So, it costs $94,860 to repave Lewis' street.

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

\[ \text{Difference} = 94860 - 29100 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 94860 - 29100 = 65760 \]

So, it costs $65,760 more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 65760 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.
- The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so it takes 50 months in total.
- After the first 5 months, each month's funding is 50% more than the previous month's funding.

Let's calculate the funding for the remaining months:

1. The first 5 months cost $100,000.
2. The next 45 months (50 months total - 5 months already spent) will have funding that increases by 50% each month.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the funding for each of the next 45 months and sum it up.

Let's denote the initial funding for the 6th month as \( F_6 \). Since the funding increases by 50% each month, we can express the funding for each subsequent month as follows:

- \( F_6 = 1.5 \times F_5 \)
- \( F_7 = 1.5 \times F_6 = 1.5^2 \times F_5 \)
- \( F_8 = 1.5 \times F_7 = 1.5^3 \times F_5 \)
- And so on...

The total funding for the next 45 months can be calculated as the sum of a geometric series where the first term \( a = F_5 \) and the common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[ S = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

Here, \( a = F_5 \), \( r = 1.5 \), and \( n = 45 \).

Since \( F_5 = 100,000 \) (the funding for the 6th month is 50% more than the 5th month, which is the same as the 5th month's funding), we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ S = 100,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} \]

Now, let's calculate \( 1.5^{45} \):
\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1.1576 \times 10^{10} \]

So the sum \( S \) is:
\[ S = 100,000 \frac{1.1576 \times 10^{10} - 1}{0.5} \]
\[ S = 100,000 \times 2 \times (1.1576 \times 10^{10} - 1) \]
\[ S = 200,000 \times (1.1576 \times 10^{10} - 1) \]
\[ S = 200,000 \times 1.1576 \times 10^{10} - 200,000 \]
\[ S = 2.3152 \times 10^{14} - 200,000 \]
\[ S \approx 2.3152 \times 10^{14} \]

Now, we add the initial $100,000 for the first 5 months to the total funding for the next 45 months:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 2.3152 \times 10^{14} \]

So the total cost of the research is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2.3152 \times 10^{14} + 100,000 \]

To get the final numerical answer:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2.3152 \times 10^{14} + 100,000 \approx 2.3152 \times 10^{14} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the research is approximately \( 2.3152 \times 10^{14} \) dollars."
"To solve this, let's break down the meat consumption for each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the meat consumption:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of posts in March. March has 31 days.

If each of the 1000 members posts an average of 3 times a day, then the total number of posts per day for the group is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93000."
"To solve this, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ \text{Total loads in a year} = 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so:
\[ \text{Total gallons of water used in a year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} = \$312 \text{ per year} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks:
Scarlett bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each, so the cost for the rocks is:
2 * $2.50 = $5.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the coral:
She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each, so the cost for the coral is:
3 * $2.00 = $6.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the fish:
She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, so the cost for the fish is:
20 * $0.50 = $10.00

The cost of the fish food is given as $2.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of the aquarium = $10.00
Cost of the rocks = $5.00
Cost of the coral = $6.00
Cost of the fish = $10.00
Cost of the fish food = $2.00

Total cost = $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

So, the final numerical answer is $33.00."
"To find out how tall Jane's beanstalk was after 3 weeks, let's calculate its height week by week.

1. After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
2. In the second week, it doubled in height. So, the height after the second week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
3. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. So, the height after the third week is \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"First, let's find out how much meat Prince can sell in one day. Since he sells 15kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day, we can calculate the total meat sold per day as follows:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell 750kg of meat from the bull. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat sold per day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.

Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 seats = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats were left.

Remaining seats = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.

Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 seats = 18 seats

To find out how many seats were occupied by the students, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators and the parents from the remaining seats.

Seats occupied by students = 54 seats - 18 seats (administrators) - 18 seats (parents) = 18 seats

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection. Since each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the total number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights for all intersections is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

Now, we know that 20 of these street lights are not working. So, the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 76 \]"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to their maximum play counts.

The first DVD can be played 1000 times and has been played 356 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ more times} \]

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times and has been played 135 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ more times} \]

Now, we add the remaining play counts of both DVDs:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.

He went twice a week for 2 hours each time, so each week he spent:
\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since he went for 6 weeks, the total number of hours he spent is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost for 24 hours is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the physical therapy is:
\[ 3000 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece every 2 hours and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school hours as follows:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed during school} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home and after dinner:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed on the way home} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Pieces chewed after dinner} = 1 \]

So, the total number of pieces chewed during the day is:

\[ \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 \text{ (during school)} + 1 \text{ (on the way home)} + 1 \text{ (after dinner)} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to account for the pieces he gives to his sister. He gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister right before bed. Initially, he has 20 pieces. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:

\[ \text{Remaining pieces before giving to sister} = 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

He gives half of these remaining pieces to his sister:

\[ \text{Pieces given to sister} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces left after giving some to his sister is:

\[ \text{Remaining pieces after giving to sister} = 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the final number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can subtract 12 years from 16 to find her current age.

So, her current age is:
\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 years to her current age:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. He bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. He bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so:

\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:

\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"First, we need to find out the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. So, we calculate the number of bloomed flowers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bloomed flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is 160."
"First, we need to convert Ashley's internet speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s).

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing 20 by 1000:

\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how many megabytes per hour (Mb/h) this is. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600:

\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/h."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So for three days, it would be:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days (Tuesday through Friday), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. So it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
For these four days, it would be:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Now, to find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the cars towed in the first three days to the cars towed in the last four days:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars the tow truck towed that week is 54."
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Adam's height in feet = 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.3333 feet

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet.

So, Adam needs to grow 4 feet - 3.3333 feet = 0.6667 feet more to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the additional height he needs into inches to find out how many years it will take.

0.6667 feet * 12 inches/foot = 8 inches

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches.

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold. Each car costs $25,000, so:

\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. So, the cost the company paid for the cars is:

\[ 250,000 \times 0.30 = 75,000 \]

Now, we need to find out the profit James made. The profit is the total cost of the cars minus the cost the company paid:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17,500 \]"
"First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{60}{100} \times 25 = 15 \text{ women} \]

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. We know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. Since a diamond jewel costs $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. We know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"First, let's find out how many truck stamps Max bought. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and he bought 16 snowflake stamps, we can calculate the number of truck stamps as follows:

Number of truck stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + 3
Number of truck stamps = 16 + 3
Number of truck stamps = 19

Next, we need to find out how many rose stamps Max bought. Since he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, we can calculate the number of rose stamps as follows:

Number of rose stamps = Number of truck stamps - 9
Number of rose stamps = 19 - 9
Number of rose stamps = 10

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps together:

Total number of stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + Number of truck stamps + Number of rose stamps
Total number of stamps = 16 + 19 + 10
Total number of stamps = 45

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's determine the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"To solve this, we need to find out how much each class costs on average if Manny misses some classes. Let's denote the cost per class as \( C \).

If Manny misses \( x \) classes out of 10, he will have taken \( 10 - x \) classes. The total cost for these classes is $60. So, the cost per class \( C \) can be calculated as:

\[ C = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

According to the parents' condition, if the cost per class is more than $10, they won't sign him up again. So, we need to find the maximum \( x \) such that:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Let's solve this inequality:

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many customers Julie processes and then calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel.

First, let's find out how many customers Julie processes in a day. Since Jewel processes 50 customers a day and Julie processes twice as fast, we can calculate Julie's daily customer count as follows:

\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. Since they work all days of the week, we multiply their daily customer counts by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]
\[ \text{Jewel's weekly customers} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]

Now, we add the weekly customer counts of Julie and Jewel to find the total weekly production:

\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Julie's weekly customers} + \text{Jewel's weekly customers} = 700 + 350 = 1050 \]

So, the total weekly production for the two is:

\[ 1050 \]"
"First, let's find out how far Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we can calculate Reggie's distance as follows:

Reggie's distance = 5 * Paisley's distance
Reggie's distance = 5 * 4
Reggie's distance = 20 miles

Now, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how far Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 17 miles

So, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"First, let's find out the cost of one apple and one orange.

For apples:
- 4 apples cost $5.20
- So, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

For oranges:
- 3 oranges cost $3.30
- So, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Cost of 5 apples = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

So, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. So, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 216 seconds."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Total extra cost = $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Now, let's add the base price of the truck to the total extra cost:
- Base price of the truck: $30,000
- Total extra cost: $13,500

Total cost = $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the raise. A 5% raise on $20000 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Raise amount} = 20000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:

\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, we need to add the bonus. The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:

\[ \text{Bonus} = 20000 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10000 \]

So, his total monthly salary including the bonus is:

\[ \text{Total monthly salary} = 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his total monthly salary by 12 (months in a year):

\[ \text{Annual salary} = 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 372000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, let's find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the cost of a pair of dress pants is:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
James buys 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits. So, the total number of dress shirts he buys is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, to find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ 10800 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February.

First, let's find out how many articles the news website publishes in February. The news website publishes an average of 20 articles every day. Since February has 28 days, we multiply the daily average by the number of days in February:

\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, let's find out how many articles the sister company publishes in February. The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles every day. Again, since February has 28 days, we multiply the daily average by the number of days in February:

\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, to find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we add the number of articles published by the news website to the number of articles published by the sister company:

\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

So, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:

\[ 840 \]"
"First, let's find out how old Steve's wife is. Since Steve is 60 years old and his wife is 4 years older, we can calculate her age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's wife's age} = 60 + 4 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Steve's son is. The problem states that his son is half as old as his mom. Since his mom is 64 years old, we can calculate his age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's son's age} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]

Now, we need to find out how old Steve's son's wife is. The problem states that she is 3 years younger than her husband. Since Steve's son is 32 years old, we can calculate her age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's son's wife's age} = 32 - 3 = 29 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 29 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much flour is in one bag before it is divided into portions. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms/portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags in total. We do this by multiplying the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

\[ 16 \text{ kilograms/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Alisa biked. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Speed} = 12 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

So,
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \times 4.5 \]

Now, let's calculate the distance:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 54 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate how many miles Stanley biked. Using the same formula:

For Stanley:
\[ \text{Speed} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

So,
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \times 2.5 \]

Now, let's calculate the distance:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we add their distances together:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 + 25 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total number of miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"First, let's calculate how long it will take Bill to dig through the soil. He can dig 4 feet of soil per hour. If he has to dig 24 feet of soil, we can find the time it takes by dividing the total feet of soil by the rate of digging through soil:

\[ \text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate how long it will take him to dig through the clay. He can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so he can dig 2 feet of clay per hour. If he has to dig 8 feet of clay, we can find the time it takes by dividing the total feet of clay by the rate of digging through clay:

\[ \text{Time to dig through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 10 hours."
"First, let's determine how many people are in Howie's class. We know there is Howie, his teacher, and 25 classmates. So, the total number of people is:

1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people

Since Howie wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, he needs to buy 2 cupcakes for each of the 27 people. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes he should buy is:

27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes

So, the final numerical answer is 54 cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many likes the photo had three weeks after Fishio posted it. We know that after 1 week, she had 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.

Initial number of likes = 2000
Number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * initial number of likes
Number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000
Number of likes after 3 weeks = 140000

Now, if she received 20000 more new likes recently, we add these to the 140000 likes.

Total number of likes = 140000 + 20000
Total number of likes = 160000

So, the final numerical answer is 160000 likes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got $2 off because of the voucher, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats were twice that amount because they were half the total amount from green hats.
   - So, the sales from green hats in the first month were \(400 \times 2 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - The total sales for the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - So, the total sales for the first month were \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - The sales for the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month.
   - So, the sales for the second month were \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - The total sales for the two months were the sum of the sales from the first and second months.
   - So, the total sales for the two months were \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 2100."
"First, let's break down the time James hires the carriage. He hires it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours in total. However, he gets 1 hour free. So, he pays for 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost for the first hour is $15. The cost for each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour, which is $15 * 2 = $30.

So, the cost for the second hour is $30 and for the third hour is also $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

So, James paid $75."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the amount she actually has in her bank account.

First, let's find out how much Sally earned this week. She started with $200 and now has $420. So, the amount she earned is:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Next, we know her weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract her weekly wage from the amount she earned:
\[ 220 - 300 = -80 \]

Since the result is negative, it means that the amount withheld is actually $80. So, the dollars withheld from Sally’s wage are:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"First, let's determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs in total. Since each of her 16 guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves, we can calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed as follows:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can calculate the number of whole eggs needed as follows:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves per whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we can calculate the number of dozens as follows:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Shiela has already written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

So, Shiela has written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages:

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write. The final numerical answer is:

10"
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. If the book is 200 pages long, we can calculate the number of days it will take him to finish by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \]

So, Mike will finish his reading in 20 days. To find out how many days before the deadline he will finish, we subtract the number of days he will take to read the book from the total deadline days.

\[ \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Total deadline days} - \text{Number of days to finish} = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost for renting the hanger and fuel. The cost for renting the hanger is $5000 a month. The cost for fuel is twice that, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10000 a month.

So, the total monthly cost for renting the hanger and fuel is $5000 + $10000 = $15000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year). So, $15000 * 12 = $180000.

Now, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total yearly maintenance cost. The plane cost $150000, and the yearly maintenance cost is $180000.

So, the total cost for the first year is $150000 + $180000 = $330000.

The final numerical answer is $330000."
"First, let's find out how long it took to cook pork. Since it took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took 30 minutes to cook rice, we can calculate the cooking time for pork as follows:

Cooking time for pork = Cooking time for rice + 20 minutes
Cooking time for pork = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
Cooking time for pork = 50 minutes

Next, we need to find out the combined cooking time for pork and rice:

Combined cooking time for pork and rice = Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for rice
Combined cooking time for pork and rice = 50 minutes + 30 minutes
Combined cooking time for pork and rice = 80 minutes

Now, we know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, we can calculate the cooking time for beans:

Cooking time for beans = 1/2 * Combined cooking time for pork and rice
Cooking time for beans = 1/2 * 80 minutes
Cooking time for beans = 40 minutes

Finally, to find out the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork:

Total cooking time = Cooking time for rice + Cooking time for beans + Cooking time for pork
Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 40 minutes + 50 minutes
Total cooking time = 120 minutes

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \]

So, the total cost for the first mixture is:
\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \]

So, the total cost for the second mixture is:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Now, to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's use the information given:

- Each sheep has 4 legs and 1 head.
- Each goose has 2 legs and 1 head.
- The total number of animal heads is 20.
- The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

From the information given, we can write two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( S + G = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Now, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15."
"First, let's find out the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand per pound, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = \text{Cost of normal coffee} + (\text{Cost of normal coffee} \times 20\%) \]
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = 5 + (5 \times 0.20) \]
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = 5 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = 6 \]

Roger needs to buy a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound per day. So, he needs to buy 7 pounds of coffee. The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:

\[ \text{Cost of 7 pounds of more expensive coffee} = 7 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 7 pounds of more expensive coffee} = 42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost is the cost of the coffee plus the cost of the donut:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of 7 pounds of more expensive coffee} + \text{Cost of the donut} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 42 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 44 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

So, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

So, we do the following calculation:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - Newspapers delivered to District A - Newspapers delivered to District C

Let's do the math:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

First, subtract the newspapers to District A from the total:

600 - 198 = 402

Then, subtract the newspapers to District C from the result:

402 - 209 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final numerical answer is 193."
"First, let's calculate the total number of class hours John attends. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, the total class hours per week is:

\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class hours over the 6 weeks is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class hours by the number of hours it takes to learn one recipe:

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 360 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now we have the amounts of money each person has:
- Aurelia: $120
- Kassidy: $90
- Rayna: $150

Next, we add up all their money to find the total:

\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

"First, let's determine how many toys James needs initially. He has 4 dogs and 4 toys, so each dog has one toy. Now, there are 8 more dogs, so he needs 8 more toys. That makes a total of:

\[ 4 \text{ (current toys)} + 8 \text{ (additional toys)} = 12 \text{ toys} \]

After buying the toys, James went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since he had 4 dogs when he left, twice as many more dogs means:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ more dogs} \]

So, the total number of dogs now is:

\[ 4 \text{ (original dogs)} + 8 \text{ (additional dogs)} = 12 \text{ dogs} \]

Each dog still needs one toy, so he needs:

\[ 12 \text{ toys} \]

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. The total number of dogs now is:

\[ 12 \text{ (current dogs)} - 3 \text{ (gone dogs)} = 9 \text{ dogs} \]

Since each dog still needs one toy, he needs:

\[ 9 \text{ toys} \]

So, the total number of toys James needs is:

\[ 9 \text{ toys} \]

The final numerical answer is:

So, the final numerical answer is 576."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack weighs 80 kg.
Each of the 8 other adults weighs 80 kg, so together they weigh \(8 \times 80\) kg.

Now, let's add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg} + 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 80 \, \text{kg} + 640 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

"First, let's find out how many cookies Max has. We know that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies. So, if we add 5 to 68, we get the number of cookies Max has:

\[ 68 + 5 = 73 \]

So, Max has 73 cookies.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if we subtract 12 from 73, we get the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:

\[ 73 - 12 = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Now, we need to find out how many cookies Summer has. We know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, if we add 23 to 73, we get the number of cookies Summer has:

\[ 73 + 23 = 96 \]

So, Summer has 96 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they all have, we add the number of cookies each person has:

\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's add these numbers step by step:

\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \).

She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how long it takes Chris to mow the lawn in each mode.

In ""turtle"" mode, it takes him 1 hour to mow the entire lawn. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, it takes him 60 minutes to mow the lawn in ""turtle"" mode.

In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes him 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Chris mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode. So, he mows 30 minutes in ""turtle"" mode (half of 60 minutes) and 20 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode (half of 40 minutes).

Now, let's add the time he spent in each mode to find the total time it took him to mow the lawn.

Total time = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 50 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 50 minutes."
"First, let's add up the time it takes for John and Jack to get to the library and then to the fire station.

Time to library: 6 minutes
Time to fire station: 13 minutes

Total time spent: 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. So, to find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time they've already spent from the total time they have.

Time left: 30 - 19 = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit Catherine bought:

- Apples: 1 kilo at $4 per kilo = $4
- Bananas: 2 kilos at $2 per kilo = 2 * $2 = $4
- Oranges: 2 kilos at $3 per kilo = 2 * $3 = $6

Now, let's add up the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, let's add the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda together:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, they eat 10 cookies while they are cooling. So, we subtract the 10 cookies they ate from the total:

\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44, so:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now, we substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets (\( Tr = 6 \)), we can find the age of the twin:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's add up the time John needs to finish his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many minutes John has left for napping:

Total minutes before dinner - Total homework time = Minutes for napping
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's find out the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how many coins Rong saves in a year. Since Rong saves 20 coins every month, in a year (which has 12 months), he saves:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 240 \text{ coins/year} \]

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves in a year. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. So, Neil saves:

\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In a year, Neil saves:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 336 \text{ coins/year} \]

Now, let's calculate how many coins they each have after 10 years. For Rong:

\[ 240 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

For Neil:

\[ 336 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the coins they both have after 10 years:

\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.6T \).

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we can rearrange the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's find out the cost of each type of fruit:

- The cost of one apple is $0.5.
- The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, so it's $0.5 * 2 = $1.
- The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so it's $1 * 3 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit:

- The cost of 5 bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
- The cost of 12 apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
- The cost of 7 oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

Adding these together gives the total cost for one crate of fruit:

$5 (bananas) + $6 (apples) + $21 (oranges) = $32.

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"First, let's find out how many squares of each color there are:

- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, let's add up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:

Total squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares
Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total squares = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final numerical answer is:
68"
"First, let's find out how many chairs Mia currently has. We know that there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out the total number of chairs Mia currently has:

\[ 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function. So, the total number of people attending the function is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Since we need to find out how many more chairs Mia has to get, we need to subtract the number of chairs she currently has from the total number of people attending:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia has to get 9 more chairs. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's find out how many deer are bucks. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50\% \times 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

So, the number of 8 point bucks is 5."
"First, let's find out how many points Betty collected. If Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, and Adam has 50 points, then:

\[ \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (50 \times 0.30) = 50 + 15 = 65 \]

Next, we need to find out how many points Tom collected. Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so:

\[ \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35 \]

Now, we need to find out how many points Martha collected. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so:

\[ \text{Martha's points} = 35 \times 3 = 105 \]

Now we can add up all the points collected by Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom:

\[ \text{Total points} = 50 + 105 + 65 + 35 = 255 \]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points, so the class is missing:

\[ \text{Points missing} = 400 - 255 = 145 \]

So, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her 3 children has 3 grandchildren.
   - So, the total number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 great grand-babies.
   - So, the total number of great grand-babies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Amount for retirement} = 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment.

\[ \text{Amount for car payment} = 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and the amount she used for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left.

\[ \text{Money left} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the final amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."
"First, we need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box. If the box can hold 20 pencils and 4 are missing, then the number of pencils in the box is:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

A pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils. To find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we divide the number of pencils by 2:

\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the display:

15 boxes of 20 fireworks each:
15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

3 boxes of 5 fireworks each:
3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

Now, let's add the fireworks from the display and the backyard to find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

300 (from the display) + 15 (from her backyard) = 315 fireworks

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 315."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person gets a seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the cost for each person:

- Cost of drinks per person: \(2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per drink} = \$4\)
- Cost of snacks per person: \(3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2 \text{ per snack} = \$6\)

So, the total cost per person for drinks and snacks is:

\[ \$4 + \$6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times \$10 \text{ per person} = \$200 \]

Therefore, the group has spent a total of \$200 on drinks and snacks."
"First, let's find out how much gravel Gordy's truck can haul. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,800 pounds

Now, we know that when Gissela, Gordy, and Gary bring their trucks together, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. We can represent this as:

Total capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + Gordy's truck capacity + Gary's truck capacity
11,600 pounds = 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds + Gary's truck capacity

To find Gary's truck capacity, we need to subtract the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 pounds - 4,000 pounds - 4,800 pounds
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds
Gary's truck capacity = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
dumplings. With 8 males, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

So, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much money Gerald and Julia each received from the $100.

The total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Gerald's share is 3 parts out of 5, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60 \]

Julia's share is 2 parts out of 5, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Julia's share} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Now, Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his share:
\[ \text{Gerald's money left} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to find out how fast the turtle is. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second, so the turtle's speed is:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ \text{Turtle's distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"First, let's find out how much money the firefighters have raised per hour. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so we divide $2100 by 3 to find the amount raised per hour.

\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we know their goal is to raise $6300. They have already raised $2100, so we need to find out how much more they need to raise.

\[ \text{Amount still needed} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Since they raise $700 per hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining $4200.

\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to raise for a total of 3 (already raised) + 6 (remaining) = 9 hours to reach their goal.

The final numerical answer is 9 hours."
"First, let's find out what percentage of the total water from the Colorado River is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City. Since Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River and 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the industrial usage as follows:

\[ \text{Industrial usage} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]

This means 32% of the total water from the Colorado River is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City.

To find out what percentage of the total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total usage percentage:

\[ \text{Non-industrial usage} = 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%."

1. Calculate the cost for one week:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Alex charges $12 per day.
   - So, the cost for one week is \(7 \times 12 = 84\) dollars.

2. Now, calculate the cost for 2 weeks:
   - The cost for one week is $84.
   - For 2 weeks, the cost is \(84 \times 2 = 168\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 168 dollars."
"First, let's find out how much ice cream the factory makes per hour.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 100 quarts in 2 hours means the factory makes 100/2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 50 quarts in 4 hours means the factory makes 50/4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Finally, to find the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours:
- 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

So, the final numerical answer is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $49.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $49.00:

Discount = 10% of $49.00 = 0.10 * $49.00 = $4.90

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = Total cost - Discount = $49.00 - $4.90 = $44.10

So, Marcus' total bill is $44.10."
"First, let's understand the deal: for every 2 scoops you buy, you get 1 scoop for free. This means for every 3 scoops, you only pay for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50.

Erin has $6.00.

To find out how many scoops she can get, we need to calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with her $6.00.

Let's calculate the number of sets of 3 scoops she can buy:
\[ \text{Number of sets} = \frac{\text{Total money Erin has}}{\text{Cost of 3 scoops}} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 3 scoops} = 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]
\[ \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which means she can get:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream."
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, two weeks would be 14 days. Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day, so in 14 days, she will have eaten:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Ginger started with 100 pieces, after eating 56 pieces, she will have:

\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day, so in 14 days, she will have eaten:

\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Amy started with 100 pieces, after eating 42 pieces, she will have:

\[ 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the number of pieces Ginger has from the number of pieces Amy has:

\[ 58 - 44 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"First, we need to find out what two thirds of Mr. Boarden's bathroom is. His bathroom is 36 square feet, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Two thirds of 36 sq ft} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles needed would be:

\[ 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 576."
"First, let's calculate how much James spent picking the blueberries.

He paid a flat fee of $20 to go picking and then an additional $1.5 for each pound of blueberries he picked. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

So, the total cost for James to pick the blueberries is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate how much it would cost James to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds, so the cost at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself compared to buying them at the store."
"First, let's find out the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wanted to buy 500 computers at this new price. To find the total amount of money they paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:

\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Then, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses 2 oz of ham, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:
\[ 450 \text{ calories} + 240 \text{ calories} + 80 \text{ calories} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the omelet is:
\[ 770 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Since each pencil costs $0.50 and you bought 6 pencils, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 0.50 \times 6 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the erasers. Since each eraser costs $0.25 and you bought 8 erasers, the total cost for the erasers is:
\[ 0.25 \times 8 = 2.00 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the items you bought by adding the cost of the pencils and the cost of the erasers:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for all the items. To find out how much change you would get, subtract the total cost from the amount you paid:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 people receive interviews, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we find out how many of these interviewees receive a job offer. Since 20% of the interviewees receive a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of these job offer recipients accept the position. Since a third of the job offer recipients accept the position, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

So, 2 people accept the position."
"First, let's find out how many sacks Goldy gave away in total. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so:

3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks

Now, we know that each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice. To find out the total kilograms of rice she gave away, we multiply the number of sacks given away by the weight per sack:

7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

So, the final numerical answer is 175 kilograms."
"First, let's find out how many boxes of cereal Castle bought this week. She bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, so:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

So, Castle bought 8 boxes of cereal this week.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find out how many more boxes of cereal she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number she bought this week:

\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \]

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga makes when she is dancing with both hands at her sides.

She taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when both hands are at her sides is:
\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 5 minutes, the total number of taps when both hands are at her sides is:
\[ 550 \times 5 = 2750 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps she makes when she raises her arms.

When her arms are raised, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, the total number of taps when her arms are raised is:
\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the combined total number of taps:
\[ 2750 + 800 = 3550 \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:
\[ 3550 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.
The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket, so for 3 buckets it would be \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

So, the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself is:
\[120 + 75 = 195\]

Now, let's compare this to the damage the pothole would do to his car, which is $450.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself is:
\[450 - 195 = 255\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[255\]"
"First, let's find out how many normal chairs are left after some were sent for repair. The restaurant originally had 170 normal chairs, and 20 of them were sent for repair. So, the number of normal chairs left is:

\[ 170 - 20 = 150 \]

Next, let's find out how many baby chairs are left after some were sent for repair. The restaurant originally had 23 baby chairs, and 13 of them were sent for repair. So, the number of baby chairs left is:

\[ 23 - 13 = 10 \]

Now, to find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant, we add the number of normal chairs left to the number of baby chairs left:

\[ 150 + 10 = 160 \]

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices and there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends), the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ slices} \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends and the slices eaten by the other two friends:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 20 minutes. The average time is calculated by adding the two times and dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's convert Topher's shoe length to inches only. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. Let's confirm this by plugging it back into the original equation:

\[ 9 \times 10 + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The equation holds true, so the length of one of Bobby's shoes is indeed 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars and teachers' cars.

For the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Next, we calculate how many windows Hannah smashes.

For the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of 256 windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- She smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed from both types of cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (from students' cars) + 48 (from teachers' cars) = 112 windows.

So, the final numerical answer is:
112"
"First, let's find the total number of spools of thread Candy has. We add up all the spools:

15 light blue spools + 45 dark blue spools + 40 light green spools + 50 dark green spools = 150 spools in total.

Now, we need to find out how many of these are blue. We add the light blue and dark blue spools:

15 light blue spools + 45 dark blue spools = 60 blue spools.

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 0.4 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"First, let's find out how many people had voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the people had voted by midday, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{People who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by midday is:

\[ \text{People who had not voted by midday} = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people after midday are 3000, so:

\[ \text{People who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[ \text{People who had not voted by 16:00} = 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first need to calculate how many pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so in 30 days he will chew:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of gum he will need. Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of pieces he will chew by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

Each kid wants 2 smores and there are 9 kids, so:
\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores/kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]

Each adult will eat 1 smore and there are 6 adults, so:
\[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore/adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Adding the smores for kids and adults together:
\[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Now, we know that each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. To find out how many sleeves are needed for 24 smores, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores/sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, they will need:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves/box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

So, they will need 1 box of graham crackers."
"First, let's find out Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Now, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

Total age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total age = 87

So, the final numerical answer is 87."
"To find out how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 siblings make a total of 4 people.

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Each person, including Greg, gets $5."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, we can calculate the total weight of these books as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, we can add these weights together:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the weight of her history book. The problem states that her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, we can calculate the weight of her history book as follows:

\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the weight of all her books together:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 7 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B got. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, and candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B's votes = Candidate A's votes + 50% of Candidate A's votes
Candidate B's votes = 20 + 0.50 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. So, the votes for candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total votes.

Votes for candidate C = Total votes - (Votes for candidate A + Votes for candidate B)
Votes for candidate C = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube:

For the giant cubes:
3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces

For the medium cubes:
7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces

For the small cubes:
8 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total water used:
12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

32 ounces (initial amount) - 30 ounces (used) = 2 ounces

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"If Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven, then Steven has half the number of books Clara has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: 20 - 16 = 4.

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's find out how much a half-gallon jar costs. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

The cost for 10 gallon jars is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money spent:
\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students like to play music. We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the total number of students in the class is 50. We also know the number of students who like to bake, which is 10. So, the number of students who like to play video games or play music is:

\[ 50 - (10 + 5) = 50 - 15 = 35 \]

Since we already found that 10 students like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ 35 - 10 = 25 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's find out how many birds were scared away. Jeremy threw a stone and scared away 1/3 of the 12 birds. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

This means 4 birds were scared away. Now, we need to find out how many birds are left after the stone was thrown:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the backyard. So, we add these 20 birds to the 8 birds that were left:

\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

So, the total number of birds now in the backyard is 28."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of students in the school**: 80
2. **Number of classes**: 2
3. **Students per class**: Since the total number of students is 80 and there are 2 classes, we divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class.
   \[
   \text{Students per class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]
4. **Percentage of girls in each class**: 40%
5. **Number of girls in each class**: To find the number of girls in each class, we take 40% of the 40 students in each class.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16
   \]
6. **Number of boys in each class**: Since each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the rest must be boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."
"Mara initially had 2 slices and added 3 more slices, so she had 2 + 3 = 5 slices on the plate.

She then tripled the number of slices, so she had 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

After eating 2 slices, she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Then her friend stole 5 slices, so she had 13 - 5 = 8 slices remaining on the plate.

The final number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"First, we need to find out the total number of animals Melissa needs to groom this week. We do this by adding the number of each type of animal:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 28 animals to groom in total. Since she needs to split these jobs evenly over the days of the week, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week (which is 7):

\[ \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards Mark got. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. So, the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the profit Mark made is:
\[ 1100 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at $26 each is \(2 \times 26 = 52\).
- The cost for 2 children at $12 each is \(2 \times 12 = 24\).
- So, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at $14 each is \(2 \times 14 = 28\).
- The cost for 2 children at $10 each is \(2 \times 10 = 20\).
- So, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\).

Now, to find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park:
- The savings are \(76 - 48 = 28\).

So, they will be able to save **28** dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"First, let's calculate how much money the vendor used to spend on tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $0.5 each and he sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, the daily cost is:

\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, let's calculate how much money he spends a day with his new vendor. The new vendor sells them for $0.4 each. So, the daily cost with the new vendor is:

\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

To find out how much money he saves a day, we subtract the new cost from the old cost:

\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out how much money he saves in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily savings by 7:

\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$350 \]

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we can solve for Cal's marbles:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add Carl's marbles and Cal's marbles together:

\[ \text{Combined marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 336 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many students are in each group when there are 6 groups. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[ \text{Students per group} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Now, we need to find out how many groups we can form with 12 groups. Since each group has 9 students, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group to find out how many groups we can form:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Students per group}} = \frac{54}{9} = 6 \]

The question asks how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups. Since we can only form 6 groups with 54 students, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to reach 12 groups:

\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"To solve this, let's break it down into parts:

1. Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one week:
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
   - So, in one week, Candy rents \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.

2. Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends in one week:
   - There are 2 days in the weekend.
   - Candy rents 100 chairs each day in the weekend.
   - So, in one week, Candy rents \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.

3. Calculate the total number of chairs rented in one week:
   - Total chairs rented in one week = Chairs rented during weekdays + Chairs rented during weekends
   - Total chairs rented in one week = \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.

4. Calculate the total number of chairs rented in one month (4 weeks):
   - Total chairs rented in one month = Total chairs rented in one week \(\times 4\)
   - Total chairs rented in one month = \(500 \times 4 = 2000\) chairs.

5. Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two months:
   - Total chairs rented in two months = Total chairs rented in one month \(\times 2\)
   - Total chairs rented in two months = \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs.

So, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs in two 4-week months."
"First, let's calculate how many bananas Gunther had after Arnold stole half of them the first time.

Gunther originally had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, so:
\[ \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]
\[ \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas after adding 25} = 24 + 25 = 49 \]

Later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas left after Arnold's second theft} = 49 - 12 = 37 \]

On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas after adding 6} = 37 + 6 = 43 \]

So, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile on the third day is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the yearly cost per roommate.

First, we find out how much each roommate pays each month. Since the total monthly cost is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we divide $100 by 4:

\[ \text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the yearly cost per roommate. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Yearly cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's convert the dozens into individual items to make it easier to count the glasses and plates.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 4 dozen plates is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

When the items were returned, 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken. So, the number of glasses Jeff has now is:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]

And the number of plates Jeff has now is:
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates together:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 128 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Next, let's calculate how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, and a large button is worth three small buttons, trading a large sticker for a large button is the same as trading it for three small buttons. So, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

Now, let's calculate how many large stickers she has left after trading 20 for large buttons:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers gives her:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has:

- From trading small stickers for large buttons: 27 small buttons
- From trading large stickers for large buttons: 20 large buttons
- From trading large stickers for small buttons: 60 small buttons

Since a large button is worth three small buttons, we need to convert the 20 large buttons into small buttons:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

So, the total number of small buttons Lorraine has is:

\[ 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 \text{ small buttons} \]

Since a large button is worth three small buttons, the total number of buttons (both large and small) Lorraine has is:

\[ \frac{147}{3} = 49 \text{ large buttons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 49 \]"
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, let's break it down:

- Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
- Joey played 1 match on Friday.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, let's add up all the matches:
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 4 matches

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(2 + 1 + 4 = 7\).

The final numerical answer is 7."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so we can denote the number of votes in favor as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we calculate the number of votes in favor as:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. So, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, let's add up all the students to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75\]

So, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."
"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

So, the discount amount is $7. Now, subtract this discount from the original price to find the final price you will pay:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

Therefore, after the discount, you will pay $133."
"First, we need to find out how many songs are in all 20 playlists combined. Since each playlist has 300 songs, we multiply the number of songs in one playlist by the number of playlists:

\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours these 6000 songs will last if each song is 10 hours long. We do this by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song:

\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 20% of 50 people is:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This leaves:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

people who do not think horse #2 will win. Now, 60% of these 40 people think horse #7 will win:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 40 people are left after those who think horse #2 will win, and 24 of them think horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This means that the total number of Pomeranians is three times the number of girls because 6 (number of girls) is one third of the total Pomeranians.

\[ \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

2. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since we've found that there are 18 Pomeranians, we can use this information to find the total number of puppies Jana has. If 18 Pomeranians represent two thirds of all the puppies, then we can set up the following equation to find the total number of puppies (let's call this number \( x \)):

\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 18 \]

3. To find \( x \), we can solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{3}{2} \):

\[ x = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's find out how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90, so half of that is $90 / 2 = $45.

Jayden originally had $70, so after his sister gives him $45, he has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200, so to find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera.

So, $200 - $115 = $85.

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs double the first house, and the first house needs half the second house, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) cases. Therefore, the third house needs \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) cases.

The number of cases of shingles the third house will need is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5

Then, let's calculate how much Chase spent on lettuce:
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3 each.
1 head of lettuce * $3/head = $3

Now, let's add up all the amounts to find the total spent:
Leila's spending + Jack's spending + Chase's spending
$6 + $5 + $3 = $14

So, the three of them spent a total of $14 to make a salad for the potluck."
"First, let's find out how many pears George has. If George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."
"First, let's find out how much money Marissa spent on the ball. She had $80 and spent $20 on the ball. So, the remaining money she has is:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Now, we know that each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she can buy with the remaining $60, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ 60 \div 5 = 12 \]

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times \$15/\text{liter} = \$60 \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$60."
"First, let's find out how many books Ahmed read. According to the question, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can find out how many books Ahmed read by dividing Ezra's books by 2.

Ahmed's books = Ezra's books / 2
Ahmed's books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's books = 150

Now, we know that Ahmed also decided to read 150 more books. So, the total number of books Ahmed read is:

Total Ahmed's books = Ahmed's books + 150
Total Ahmed's books = 150 + 150
Total Ahmed's books = 300

Now, let's add the total number of books Ezra and Ahmed read to find out how many books they read altogether:

Total books = Ezra's books + Total Ahmed's books
Total books = 300 + 300
Total books = 600

So, the final numerical answer is 600 books."
"First, let's calculate how much Tanya earns for teaching on Monday.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. So, her earnings from teaching are:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = 4 \times 75 = \$300 \]

Next, we need to calculate the additional earnings for teaching more than 3 classes. Since she taught 4 classes, she gets an additional $5 per day:
\[ \$5 \]

So, her total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

Now, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. So, her earnings from teaching are:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = 2 \times 30 = \$60 \]

Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not get the additional $5 per day:
\[ \$60 \]

So, her total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

Finally, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday to find her total earnings for the two days:
\[ \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$365 \]"

"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total money from eggplants is:
\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the money he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the remaining money by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \$75 \div 25 \text{ ears} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has for the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, we subtract the time spent reading from the total weekend hours:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time after reading. So, we calculate the time spent on video games:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find out what percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent playing soccer}}{\text{Total weekend hours}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. He gave 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon, so:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

Now, let's find out how many pencils Anthony had left after giving some to Brandon:

\[ \text{Remaining pencils after giving to Brandon} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. So, let's calculate how many pencils that is:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

Now, let's find out how many pencils Anthony kept. We subtract the pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils after giving some to Brandon:

\[ \text{Pencils Anthony kept} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time Jack spends traveling to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to travel one way is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives back at the same speed, the time to drive back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total travel time is:

\[ \text{Total travel time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time he is gone from home is the sum of the travel time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars. Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:

"To find out how much you have to pay after a 20% discount on a $1000 laptop, you first need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is 20% of $1000, which is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price:
\[ \text{Price After Discount} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the discount."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in series, so that's \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) movies.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, so that's \( 400 \times \frac{40}{100} = 160 \) older movies.
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older, which is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost:

- The cost for the series movies is $6 each, so for 200 series movies, the cost is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so for 160 older movies, the cost is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost for the remaining 240 movies is $10 each, so for 240 normal movies, the cost is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is $4400."
"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of fruit Winston picked:

- Peaches: $2.00 per pound, and he picked 6 pounds. So, the cost for peaches is $2.00 * 6 = $12.00.
- Plums: $1.00 per pound, and he picked 8 pounds. So, the cost for plums is $1.00 * 8 = $8.00.
- Apricots: $3.00 per pound, and he picked 6 pounds. So, the cost for apricots is $3.00 * 6 = $18.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots
Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00
Total cost = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how fast they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

They hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove to the distance they hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"To solve this, let's break down the points for each player based on the information given.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

For enemies:
- Emma gets 10 points per enemy.
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so if Emma jumps on x enemies, Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.
- Emma's score from enemies = 10x
- Ava's score from enemies = 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

For berries:
- Emma gets 5 points per berry.
- Emma collects 3 fewer berries than Ava, so if Ava collects y berries, Emma collects y - 3 berries.
- Emma's score from berries = 5(y - 3)
- Ava's score from berries = 5y

For the timer:
- Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster, so she gets 30 * 4 = 120 points less than Ava.
- Emma's score from the timer = 30 * 4 = 120
- Ava's score from the timer = 0 (since she finishes faster)

Now, let's calculate the difference in their scores:
- Difference in score = A - E
- A = 10x + 80 + 5y
- E = 10x + 5(y - 3) + 120
- Difference = (10x + 80 + 5y) - (10x + 5y - 15 + 120)
- Difference = 10x + 80 + 5y - 10x - 5y + 15 - 120
- Difference = 80 + 15 - 120
- Difference = 95 - 120
- Difference = -25

So, the difference between their two scores is -25 points. This means Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's score."
"First, let's find out how much the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each together cost. 

30 dollars + 30 dollars = 60 dollars

The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. So, the cost of the other two pizzas together is:

64 dollars - 60 dollars = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each:

4 dollars ÷ 2 = 2 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 2 dollars."
"First, let's calculate how many times they ride their bikes on a regular day. They ride their bikes 3 times a day.

So, for 5 regular days, they ride:
\[ 3 \text{ times/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ times} \]

On the two other days, they ride twice as many times as they do on a regular day. So, on these days, they ride:
\[ 3 \text{ times/day} \times 2 = 6 \text{ times/day} \]
For 2 days, they ride:
\[ 6 \text{ times/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ times} \]

Now, let's add the times they ride on the regular days and the special days:

"First, let's understand the situation. Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. He then added 17 fish from the pet store, and after adding these, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \). Therefore, the number of orange fish he bought would be \( 17 - w \).

After adding the 17 fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish would be \( 3 + (17 - w) = 20 - w \), and the total number of white fish would be \( 4 + w \).

According to the problem, after adding the 17 fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. So we can set up the following equation:
\[ 20 - w = 2(4 + w) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 20 - w = 8 + 2w \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2w + w \]
\[ 12 = 3w \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To verify, if he bought 4 white fish, he would have bought \( 17 - 4 = 13 \) orange fish. After adding these to his original 3 orange fish, he would have \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) orange fish. And after adding 4 white fish to his original 4 white fish, he would have \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) white fish. Indeed, 16 is twice 8, which confirms our solution.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. If the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, then the round trip (going to work and coming back) is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, in a week, Andy drives:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the amount of gas he uses for 50 miles is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money Andy spends on gas per week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost for 5 gallons is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, and she has 140 quarters, the total amount in quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and she has 10 twenties, the total amount in twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money she paid for the lunch:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes Ricardo can get. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and he has 5 tomato plants. So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants Ricardo can get. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and he has 8 eggplant plants. So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of tomatoes and the number of eggplants:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 142 \]"
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school is covering half of this cost, so the school will cover:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

This means John needs to cover the remaining half of the trip cost, which is $150. Since John already has $50, the amount he is missing is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"First, we need to find out how cold it gets at night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

\[ \text{Night temperature} = \text{Day temperature} - 33 \]
\[ \text{Night temperature} = 45 - 33 \]
\[ \text{Night temperature} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Since the night temperature is 12 degrees, we need to find out how much it needs to be raised to 32 degrees to prevent freezing:

\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = 32 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \text{Logs needed} = \frac{\text{Temperature increase needed}}{\text{Temperature increase per log}} \]
\[ \text{Logs needed} = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ \text{Logs needed} = 4 \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 groups formed.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. So, we calculate 3/5 of 10:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

This means 6 groups brought back seashells. Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is 12."
"Initially, there are 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 people get on. So the calculation for the number of people after the first stop is:

\[ 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 + 13 = 151 \]

At the next stop, 38 people get off. So the calculation for the number of people after the second stop is:

\[ 151 - 38 = 113 \]

Therefore, the number of people on the train is 113."
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30 day month, we need to calculate the total number of bottle caps he collects in that time and then convert that into dollars.

He finds 10 bottle caps a day, so in 30 days, he would find:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so the total money he makes is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$75 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$75 \]"
"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the first 8 hours of work. She earns $20 per hour for these hours.

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to calculate the additional hours she worked, which is 11 hours - 8 hours = 3 hours. She is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate for these additional hours. Her regular hourly rate is $20, so 150% of $20 is:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:

\[ \text{Special pay} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add the regular pay and the special pay to find out how much Jamie was paid for her work on that day:

\[ \text{Total pay} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \$250 for her work on that day."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The number of female lions is given as 12.
2. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]
3. The number of lion cubs is given as 14.

Now, to find the total number of lions, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together:
\[
\text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14 = 32
\]

So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"First, let's find out the discount amount on the jeans. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount amount is $10. Now, we subtract this discount from the original price to find the sale price of the jeans.

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, we subtract the sale price from $50.

\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then multiply that by the salary per month.

The company hires 20 new employees every month. So after one month, the number of employees becomes:
\[ 200 + 20 = 220 \]

After two months, the number of employees becomes:
\[ 220 + 20 = 240 \]

After three months, the number of employees becomes:
\[ 240 + 20 = 260 \]

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 260 \times 4000 = 1040000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1040000 \]"
"To find out how long they will be caroling, we need to add the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"".

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they are singing it twice, so:
150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they are singing it once, so:
240 seconds * 1 = 240 seconds

Now, we add the time for both songs:
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

So, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"First, let's calculate Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

Billy's initial pay rate was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise to $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise to $11.00 per hour.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for 20 hours at each of these rates:
- For the first 2 months (20 hours * $10.00/hour) = $200.00
- For the next 2 months (20 hours * $10.50/hour) = $210.00
- For the next 2 months (20 hours * $11.00/hour) = $220.00

So, Billy's total earnings for 60 hours are $200.00 + $210.00 + $220.00 = $630.00.

Next, let's calculate Sally's starting salary. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10.00 per hour. So, Sally's starting salary is $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours at $10.50 per hour:
- Sally's total earnings for 20 hours = 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.00.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally:
- Difference in earnings = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings = $630.00 - $210.00 = $420.00.

So, Billy will earn $420.00 more than Sally."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The cost of one loaf of bread is $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 3 loaves of bread is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- The cost of one bagel is $1.
- Therefore, the cost of 2 bagels is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost 4 dollars more than 2 bagels. The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

To find half of Pierson's score, we divide 278 by 2:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Now, we add 11 to this number to find Nikita's score:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their individual scores together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Next, the school has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

To find the total number of trees planted by both students and teachers, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1240 \]"
"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these up, we get:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Now, let's denote the number of stuffed goats she wants to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. This means that the number of stuffed goats \( x \) should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

6"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours she has already played:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance it travels is \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance it travels is \(70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars after 2 hours:
- The difference is \(140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles}\).

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, the total cost is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the total cost to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find the pass rates for each grade.

For the third graders:
340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.

For the fourth graders:
40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.

For the fifth graders:
The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

Third graders: 340 passed
Fourth graders: 40 passed
Fifth graders: 400 students, and 80% of them passed, so \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \) passed.

Total students who passed = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700
Total students tested = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is \( \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag holds 72 chips and he has two bags, he has:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we divide the total square inches by the height:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the quarts of tea consumed by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:

"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, but since he only had 100, he couldn't sell all of them. So, he sold out of the 100 he had. Then he ordered 100 more candies. Now he has 100 (new order) + 0 (sold) = 100 candies. Since he needs to sell 150 candies in total, he still needs to sell 150 - 100 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this, let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year.

- At the beginning of January, there are 10 students.
- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May.

So, the additional students are 320 - 10 = 310.

The final numerical answer is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed to make $105.

Since each branch costs $0.25, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total money made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Felix made $105 in a week, which has 7 days. To find out how many branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks initially:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Now, let's add these up to find the total number of petals she picks:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, so she loses \(1 \times 5 = 5\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, so she loses \(1 \times 6 = 6\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, so she loses \(1 \times 4 = 4\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, so she loses \(1 \times 7 = 7\) petals.

Now, let's subtract the petals she drops from the total:
\[101 - (5 + 6 + 4 + 7) = 101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's find out how many marshmallows John and DeSean used to make S'mores.

John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores. So together they make:
9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows in total.

They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground. So the number of marshmallows left is:
35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows.

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores they can make with the 32 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make 32 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

Now, we need to divide these 32 S'mores between John and DeSean. Since they are sharing equally, each will get:
32 ÷ 2 = 16 S'mores.

So, each kid can have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"First, let's determine how long each person can play the game.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
His two friends who are worse than him can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with one quarter.
His friend who is better than him can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with one quarter.

Now, let's calculate the total time they play together:
Jack plays for 20 minutes.
His two worse friends play for 10 minutes each, so together they play for 10 * 2 = 20 minutes.
His better friend plays for 30 minutes.

Adding these times together:
20 (Jack) + 20 (worse friends) + 30 (better friend) = 70 minutes.

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many quarters they need for 240 minutes of playtime:
They need 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

So, the final numerical answer is:
12 quarters"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Salt (S), fragrance (F), and sugar (G) are used in the same amount.
2. Oil (O) is used twice as much as salt.
3. Citrus zest (C) is used the same amount as fragrance.
4. Salt is used twice as much as citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of salt used as \( S \).

From the information given:
- \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
- \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
- \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
- \( S = 2C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = 2C \) and \( F = C \), we can substitute \( C \) with \( \frac{S}{2} \) in the equation for fragrance:
- \( F = \frac{S}{2} \)

Now, we know the total amount of each ingredient used is the same:
- Salt (S) = Sugar (G) = Salt (S)
- Oil (O) = 2S
- Fragrance (F) = \(\frac{S}{2}\)
- Citrus zest (C) = \(\frac{S}{2}\)

The total amount of the mixture is the sum of all these ingredients:
\[ S + S + S + \frac{S}{2} + 2S = 10 \text{ ounces} \]

Combining like terms:
\[ S + S + S + \frac{S}{2} + 2S = 5S + \frac{S}{2} = \frac{10S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} = \frac{11S}{2} = 10 \text{ ounces} \]

To find \( S \):
\[ \frac{11S}{2} = 10 \]
\[ 11S = 20 \]
\[ S = \frac{20}{11} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil used, which is \( 2S \):
\[ 2S = 2 \times \frac{20}{11} = \frac{40}{11} \]

So, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{40}{11} \) ounces. To get the final numerical answer:

\[ \frac{40}{11} \approx 3.636 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3.636 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the goats. John buys 3 goats at $500 each, so the total cost for the goats is:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows. John buys 2 cows at $1500 each, so the total cost for the cows is:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \]

So, the total amount of money John spent is:
\[ 4500 \]"
"Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which totals to 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes. He needs 63 cupcakes in total, so he should buy 63 - 48 = 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some to his mother is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much money the students raised. The total money raised is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the students raised:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250."
"First, let's find out how many hours Sandy walked on the second day. She walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, on the second day she walked:

\[ \text{Hours on second day} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both days to find the total time she walked:

\[ \text{Total hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \text{Total minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 720 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cars were in the parking lot during the lunch break before any left.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars, and then 20 more cars arrived during the first break. So, the total number of cars before any left is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of these cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"First, let's find out how much John makes in one day. He does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. So, the total number of tasks he does in one day is:

\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

Each task pays $1.20, so the total amount he makes in one day is:

\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times $1.20/\text{task} = $180/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a full 7 day week, we multiply the daily earnings by 7:

\[ $180/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = $1260 \]

So, the final numerical answer is $1260."
"First, let's find out how many points Julie scored in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, and Sasha scored 14 points, we can calculate Julie's score as follows:

Julie's score in the first game = Sasha's score in the first game - 4
Julie's score in the first game = 14 - 4
Julie's score in the first game = 10 points

Now, we know that in the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie did in the first game. So, we can calculate Sasha's score in the second game as follows:

Sasha's score in the second game = Julie's score in the first game - 6
Sasha's score in the second game = 10 - 6
Sasha's score in the second game = 4 points

Now, to find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games:

Total points Sasha scored = Sasha's score in the first game + Sasha's score in the second game
Total points Sasha scored = 14 + 4
Total points Sasha scored = 18 points

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 153 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Cindy has 5 green eggs.
- She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
- She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
- She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

So, the final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we calculate:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we find out how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refundable amount from the total cost of the book and shipping:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Milly will lose:

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

Cost of two pairs of jeans: 2 * $30 = $60
Cost of the bag: $20

Total cost of the items: $60 + $20 = $80

Now, let's find out how much money Mulan has left after buying the items.

Money left: Total amount after receiving money - Total cost of the items
Money left: $140 - $80 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

First week: 8,000 bars
Second week: Half of the first week, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Third week: Three times the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. So, to find out how many he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly total:
50,000 (monthly total) - 36,000 (first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok videos each week. She records 18 videos, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, the total time spent on TikTok videos each week is:

\[ 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to add the time she spends writing songs. She spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add the time she spends doing her makeup. She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. So, the total time spent on makeup each week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we add up all the time she spends on TikTok-related activities each week:

\[ 72 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 282 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4 to find the monthly total:

\[ 282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 1128 \text{ minutes/month} \]

So, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:

\[ 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs.

Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

So, the cost for the mirrors is:
6 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $90.00

The cost for the chandeliers is:
2 chandeliers * $15.00/chandelier = $30.00

The cost for the pictures is:
20 pictures * $15.00/picture = $300.00

Now, let's add up the cost for the additional items:
$90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $420.00

The base installation cost is $129.00.

So, the total cost for Angela is:
$129.00 (base installation) + $420.00 (additional items) = $549.00

The final numerical answer is $549.00."
"First, let's find out how much money Anthony has saved. Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more money than Anthony. To find out how much Roy has saved, we need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to Anthony's savings.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.40 * $30.00
40% of Anthony's savings = $12.00

So, Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

The final numerical answer is $42.00."
"First, let's figure out how high each person can lift a mountain based on the information given.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Now, we need to convert 480 inches into feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 40 feet."
"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he covers in each part of his journey and then add those distances together.

First, we calculate the distance he covers in the first part of his journey:
- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Next, we calculate the distance he covers in the second part of his journey:
- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 6 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
- Total Distance = Distance in first part + Distance in second part = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"First, let's understand the information given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.
- Each kangaroo travels at the same speed.
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

To find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the highway, we need to consider the speed relationship between the kangaroos and the turtles.

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can say that the total distance (D) is covered by the 3 kangaroos in 18 hours. So, the distance can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \times \text{Speed} \times 18 \]

Now, if each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, then the speed of each turtle is \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of 4 turtles together is:
\[ \text{Speed of 4 turtles} = 4 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Speed of a kangaroo} = 2 \times \text{Speed of a kangaroo} \]

Since the distance (D) remains the same, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ D = 2 \times \text{Speed of a kangaroo} \times \text{Time for 4 turtles} \]

Since the distance is the same, we can equate the two expressions for distance:
\[ 3 \times \text{Speed} \times 18 = 2 \times \text{Speed of a kangaroo} \times \text{Time for 4 turtles} \]

We can simplify this to find the time for 4 turtles:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times \text{Time for 4 turtles} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Time for 4 turtles} \]
\[ \text{Time for 4 turtles} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, it will take 27 hours for 4 turtles to cross the highway."
"First, let's find out how many dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \text{ dishes} \]

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, to find out how many dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:
\[ 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"First, let's calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the discount is $200. So, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350 now.

We know that Erika has already been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom will give her $80. So, the total amount of money she has now is:

\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

Since the total amount she has now is $350, the amount of money she has in her purse is:

\[ 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:

"First, let's find out how much milk 3 cows produce in a day. Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, 3 cows will give:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows are needed, we need to determine the difference between the desired milk production and the current milk production:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, we can calculate the number of cows needed as follows:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we need to calculate how much of each glue stick is not used and then sum these amounts.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
   - If the glue stick is 12 millimeters long, then 1/6 of it is:
     \[
     12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}
     \]
   - So, 4/6 (or 2/3) of it is not used:
     \[
     12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}
     \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
   - If the glue stick is 12 millimeters long, then 2/3 of it is:
     \[
     12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}
     \]
   - So, 1/3 of it is not used:
     \[
     12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
     \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left:
   - If the glue stick is 12 millimeters long, then 1/2 of it is:
     \[
     12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
     \]
   - So, 1/2 of it is not used:
     \[
     12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
     \]

Now, we add the lengths of the unused glue from all three sticks:

"If Jack collected 60 dishes, and Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, then Peter collected half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter collected:

\[ \text{Peter's dishes} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, and Jack has the same number of socks as dishes, which is 60, then Peter has:

\[ \text{Peter's socks} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Now, to find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add Peter's and Jack's socks and dishes:

\[ \text{Total socks} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total socks and dishes} = 180 + 90 = 270 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 270."

- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit stage: 2 minutes
- Intermission: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 + 10 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many groups can fit into the 120 minutes, given that each group takes 20 minutes.

To find the number of groups, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:
\[ \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   The principal amount is the initial amount Brenda invested, which is $300.

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year. So, the annual interest rate is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where \( t \) is the time in years. Here, \( P = 300 \), \( r = 225\% = 2.25 \) (as a decimal), and \( t = 3 \) years.
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest earned.
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Interest} = 300 + 2025 = 2325
   \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325."
"First, let's find out how many white shirts have collars and how many do not.

- Total white shirts = 40
- White shirts with collars = 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars = 40 - 20 = 20

Next, let's find out how many floral shirts have buttons and how many do not.

- Total floral shirts = 50
- Floral shirts with buttons = 20
- Floral shirts without buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons = 30
- White shirts with no collars = 20

To find the difference:

- Difference = Floral shirts without buttons - White shirts with no collars
- Difference = 30 - 20 = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars. The final numerical answer is:

10"
"First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5. We multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm after the sales.

In Farm X, he originally had 55 goats and sold 10, so the number of goats left is \(55 - 10 = 45\).

In Farm Y, he originally had 45 goats and sold 20, so the number of goats left is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y together:

\(45 + 25 = 70\)

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount he spends on shoes by the total number of pairs he buys.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food. Since each basket of green food costs $25 and you are buying 3 baskets, the total cost for the green food is:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food. Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket. So, the effective cost per basket of red food is:
\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]
Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total cost for the red food is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:
\[ 123 \]"
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many rooms are half of 90 rooms.
2. Determine the total time in minutes to clean those rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Half of 90 rooms is 45 rooms.

Step 2: It takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, for 45 rooms, the total time in minutes is:
\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 3: To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes they built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). So, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's add up all the homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built = \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\)

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.
- Let \( Y \) be my age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( Y = B - 3 \)
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( Y = S + 2 \)
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \)
4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \)

First, we can express \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).

Now, substitute \( B \) and \( S \) into the equation for \( M \):
- \( M = 3B - 1 = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute \( B \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum of all ages:
- \( Y + B + S + M = Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \).
- Simplify the left side: \( Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \).
- Combine like terms: \( 6Y + 9 = 87 \).
- Subtract 9 from both sides: \( 6Y = 78 \).
- Divide by 6: \( Y = 13 \).

So, I am 13 years old."
"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

So, Mr. Jackson needs 54 glue sticks in total.

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks he needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have some extra glue sticks left over, he will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day**: The amount of water doubles. So, the amount of water becomes:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Second Day**: The amount of water doubles again. So, the amount of water becomes:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 16000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After the Third Day**: The volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. So, the amount of water becomes:
   \[
   16000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 22000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is 22000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: We start with 10 people infected.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Adding these to the initial 10, the total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now, there are 70 infected people. Each of these 70 people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Adding these to the 70, the total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now, there are 490 infected people. Each of these 490 people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Adding these to the 490, the total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can find the total by multiplying the number of customers by the amount each customer gave:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times 20 \text{ dollars/customer} = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received. The problem states that Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total:

\[ 800 \text{ dollars} - 80 \text{ dollars} = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received, we add their individual tips together:

\[ 800 \text{ dollars} + 720 \text{ dollars} = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ 1520 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave her three daughters a total of 2 oranges each, which is 2 * 3 = 6 oranges. Her son got 3 oranges. So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ badges/year} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ badge}}{2 \text{ months}} = 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \]
In a year, Amber earns:
\[ 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 6 \text{ badges/year} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges/year} = 36 \text{ badges/year} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges/year} - 6 \text{ badges/year} = 30 \text{ badges/year} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Paige bakes banana bread. She starts at 1:00 PM and stops at 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 banana bread loaves every hour, in 5 hours she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices she can get from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised in cents is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 50 \text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \text{ cents} \]

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[ 4000 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

So, the final numerical answer is 110."
"First, let's calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.

So, the total number of burritos given to students is:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we need to account for the burritos Mr. George ate. He ate 20 burritos.

So, the total number of burritos given out (to students and Mr. George) is:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

George ordered 600 burritos in total. To find out how many burritos were leftover, we subtract the total number of burritos given out from the total number of burritos ordered:

"First, let's find out how many green cars there are. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2
Number of green cars = 12 - 2
Number of green cars = 10

Next, we need to find out how many blue cars there are. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So:

Number of blue cars = 3 * Number of green cars
Number of blue cars = 3 * 10
Number of blue cars = 30

Now, we know the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can find out the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
Number of yellow cars = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52
Number of yellow cars = 23

So, the rink has 23 yellow cars."
"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Also, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85. So we can write the equation:

\[ A + (A + 25) + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + A + 25 + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we can find the number of books Fawn has by adding 12 to the number of books Anne has:

\[ Fawn's \ books = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 28 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much the sweet potatoes weigh. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times \text{Weight of potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we can calculate the weight of the carrots as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"First, let's find out how many jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, we multiply 30 by 4:

\[ 30 \times 4 = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs to buy. We know that one box makes 10 jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed for 120 jello cups, we divide 120 by 10:

\[ 120 \div 10 = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Each box of jello costs $1.25, and Greg needs 12 boxes. So, we multiply 12 by $1.25:

\[ 12 \times 1.25 = 15 \]

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller received $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount received:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's find out how much Madeline pays in a month. Since she pays 60% of the $400, we calculate:

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the $400:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces.

\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, after the first day, the number of pieces left is:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces left after the second day is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Now, on the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.

\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \]

So, the total number of pieces he has eaten so far is the sum of the pieces eaten on the first, second, and third days:

\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out the cost of one bottle of soda. If seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, then one bottle of soda costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

Next, let's find out the cost of one bottle of water. If four bottles of water cost $8.00, then one bottle of water costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we need to calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. The cost for 3 bottles of soda is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00. The cost for 2 bottles of water is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Adding these together, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 16 \times 0.03 \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

So, the total cost for 16 bolts is $0.48.

David initially has $12.48. To find out how much money he has left after buying the bolts, we subtract the total cost from his initial amount:

\[ \text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48 \]

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Now, Paul has 80 marbles. Next, we need to find out how many marbles he loses. He loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles that is, we calculate 1/4 of 80:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the number of marbles he had after his friend gave him more:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is 60."

"First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, we know that he plans to sell each chicken for $50. So, the total amount of money he will make from selling 180 chickens is:

\[ \text{Total money from selling} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he bought the chickens for, we need to subtract the profit from the total money he will make:

\[ \text{Cost of buying the chickens} = \text{Total money from selling} - \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Cost of buying the chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is $7000."
"First, let's find out how many glasses Micah sold. We know that Julie sold 14 glasses and the total number of glasses sold by all three is 32. So, we can calculate the number of glasses sold by the boys together by subtracting the number of glasses Julie sold from the total:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between Micah and Mitchell:

18 ÷ 2 = 9 glasses

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's find out how much Iris spent on the manicure. She spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on the hair, which was $400. So, the cost of the manicure is:

\[ \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:

\[ \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa by adding the cost of the hair, manicure, and pedicure:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will make from selling her 20-meter rope at $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total money from selling the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Now, Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope at $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of rope she can buy, we divide the total money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope.

\[ \text{Meters of new rope she can buy} = \frac{\$40}{\$1.5/\text{meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters} \]

Since the rope is sold in whole meters, Sarah can only buy 26 meters of the new rope. Now, let's calculate the cost of 26 meters of the new rope.

\[ \text{Cost of 26 meters of new rope} = 26 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$39 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she made from selling the old rope.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$39 = \$1 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$1 \]"
"To solve this, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart.

1. The cost of bacon:
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   So, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. The cost of chicken:
   Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   So, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

3. The cost of strawberries:
   Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

4. The cost of apples:
   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   So, the cost of one pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2.
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
Money left = Budget - Total cost
Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

So, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert also includes a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

First, we need to find out how long the concert itself is without the encore. We subtract the encore time from the total runtime:

\[ 65 \text{ minutes} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

This 50 minutes is the length of the concert itself, which is twice the length of her usual concerts. Let's denote the usual concert length as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 2x = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the usual concerts run for 25 minutes."
"Argo originally had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys given away:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys

Now, subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys:
200 (original toys) - 150 (toys given away) = 50 toys

So, Argo has 50 toys now."
"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on those three days, we need to add up the number of chimichangas made each day.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add them up:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"First, let's find out how many microphones won't fit. If 20% of the microphones won't fit, then:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \text{ microphones} \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit. This means the number of microphones that can fit into pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ microphones} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones that can fit by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 20 pairs."
"First, let's find out how many birds are flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. The number of birds flying overhead is 2/3 of the number of birds nesting, which is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many birds are in the three groups feeding. Each group has 8 birds, so the total number of birds in the three groups is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds} \]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:

- Birds nesting: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

So the total number of birds is:

\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 34 \]"
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. She placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars, so each jar had 50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies.

The final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find out how many are left:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Now, to find out how many plants are flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find out what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percent of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percent of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"First, we need to find out how fast a thingamabob spins. We know that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob and that it spins at 121 meters per second. So, to find the speed of a thingamabob, we divide the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. So, to find the speed of a whirligig, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 55 meters per second."
"First, let's find out the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's add up the cost of the salad and the yogurt:
Cost of salad + Cost of yogurt = $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. So, the cost of the two carrots she eats every day is:
Total cost - Cost of salad and yogurt = $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is:
Cost of two carrots / 2 = $2 / 2 = $1.

So, the final numerical answer is $1."
"First, let's calculate how much Mark used to make in a day. He worked 8 hours a day and made $10 an hour, so:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate how much he makes in a week at his old pay rate:

\[ \$80/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$400/\text{week} \]

Now, let's find out his new hourly pay rate. He used to make $10 an hour and they raised it by $2 per hour, so his new pay rate is:

\[ \$10/\text{hour} + \$2/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Then, we calculate how much he makes in a day at his new pay rate:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$96/\text{day} \]

Finally, we calculate how much he makes in a week at his new pay rate:

\[ \$96/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$480/\text{week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$480."
"First, let's determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid her $6 and she mowed his lawn that many times, she mowed Joe's lawn 6 times.

Next, we calculate how many times she mowed Kamala's lawn. She mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \(3 \times 6 = 18\) times.

Then, we calculate how many times she mowed Alba's lawn. She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \(5 \times 6 = 30\) times.

Now, we add up all the money she made from mowing lawns. She made $6 from Joe, $6 from Kamala, and $6 from Alba. So, the total money she made from mowing lawns is \(6 + 6 + 6 = 18\) dollars.

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the money she made from mowing lawns from her total earnings. So, the money she made from lemonade sales is \(80 - 18 = 62\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
62"
"First, let's find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we add 16 kg to Martin's weight:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we add 8 kg to Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how many hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents it 10 times a month and each time it's for 3 hours. So, we multiply the number of times he rents it by the hours each time:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate how much money John makes in a month from renting his car. He gets $25 for each hour he rents it out:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times $25/\text{hour} = $750/\text{month} \]

Now, we need to find out his profit. His profit is the money he makes from renting the car minus his car payment. His car payment is $500 a month:

\[ $750/\text{month} - $500/\text{month} = $250/\text{month} \]

So, John's profit on his car is $250 a month."
"First, let's find out how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. So, we can calculate the number of notebooks Martha originally had by subtracting the 5 notebooks she bought from the total of 7 notebooks.

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Now, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had by multiplying Martha's original number of notebooks by 3.

\[ \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We do this by subtracting the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has.

\[ \text{Difference} = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's find out how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed by finding 1/5 of 50 miles.

\[ \text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add this additional distance to the distance Dijana rowed to find the total distance Anis rowed.

\[ \text{Total miles Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together.

\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Susan would have if she didn't give any to her husband. She made 100 cookies and her husband took 4, so:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, Susan wants to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"First, let's determine how many pages each person read.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel did yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise read \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages in total.
- Daniel read \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages in total.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:
15"
"First, let's determine how much soup is in the pot. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, he will eat from the pot. That means the pot can be divided into 4 parts for adults or 8 parts for children.

If we consider the pot as 4 parts for adults, then for each adult, there is 1 part of soup. Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, that's 2 parts of soup for adults. This leaves 4 - 2 = 2 parts of soup for the children.

Since the pot can be divided into 8 parts for children, and there are 2 parts of soup left for the children, each child can have 2/8 = 1/4 of the pot. 

Calvin and his wife each get 1 part, and there are 2 parts left for the 2 children. So, each child can have 1/4 of the pot, which means each child can have a bowl of soup 4 times from the leftover soup.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen. So, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1 = 0.50 \]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00."
"First, let's find out how much material Jo needs to make one small mask and one large mask.

For small masks:
- 2 yards of material make 4 small masks.
- So, 1 yard of material makes 4/2 = 2 small masks.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, Jo needs 1/2 = 0.5 yards of material.

For large masks:
- 2.25 yards of material make 3 large masks.
- So, 1 yard of material makes 3/2.25 = 1.333... (or 4/3) large masks.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, Jo needs 1/1.333... = 0.75 yards of material.

Now, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

For 20 small masks:
- 20 small masks * 0.5 yards per small mask = 10 yards.

For 8 large masks:
- 8 large masks * 0.75 yards per large mask = 6 yards.

Adding these together:
- 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to calculate the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies Deepa has seen. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Now, let's do the division:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
- He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
- He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on these activities:

- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Dog walking: 1 hour

Total time spent = Sleep + Work + Dog walking
Total time spent = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent
Free time = 24 - 19 = 5 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

Next, let's find out how many red shoe boxes he uses. He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. He has 9 red shoe boxes, so 1/3 of 9 is 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, let's calculate how many blue shoe boxes are left. He started with 7 blue shoe boxes and used 3, so he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

For the red shoe boxes, he started with 9 and used 3, so he has 9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, the total number of shoe boxes left is 4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Duncan's age eight years ago:**
   - Duncan's current age is 60.
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\).

2. **Set up the relationship between Duncan's and Adam's ages:**
   - According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago.
   - Let Adam's age four years ago be \(x\).
   - Therefore, \(52 = 2x\).

3. **Solve for Adam's age four years ago:**
   - \(x = \frac{52}{2} = 26\).
   - So, Adam's age four years ago was 26.

4. **Determine Adam's current age:**
   - Adam's age four years ago was 26.
   - Therefore, Adam's current age is \(26 + 4 = 30\).

5. **Calculate Adam's age in 8 years:**
   - Adam's current age is 30.
   - In 8 years, Adam will be \(30 + 8 = 38\).

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"First, let's find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has. We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Then, we add 100 acres to this amount to get the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find out how many acres the two farms have together, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. Now, to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. So, to find out how much money he earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we multiply the number of packages he completes in a day by the amount he gets paid per package:

"First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna Benny used for the red balloons. Since he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were twenty red balloons, we can calculate the total pieces of bologna used for the red balloons as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces/bologna} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. If 40 pieces were used for the red balloons, then the remaining pieces were used for the yellow balloons:

\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow} \]

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total pieces of bologna used for yellow balloons by the number of pieces used per yellow balloon:

\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces/bologna}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total over the three days, let's calculate the hours he works each day and then sum them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. So, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. So, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up the hours from all three days:
\[5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23\]

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought.

The cake costs $11.

The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons, we need to find out how many sets of 2 balloons are in 12 balloons:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ balloons}}{2 \text{ balloons/set}} = 6 \text{ sets} \]
So, the cost for the balloons is:
\[ 6 \text{ sets} \times \$0.5 \text{ per set} = \$3 \]

The ice cream costs $7 per tub, and they bought 2 tubs:
\[ 2 \text{ tubs} \times \$7 \text{ per tub} = \$14 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, we need to divide the total amount by 2:
\[ \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$14 \]"
"Kira bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit. If Lola ate 2 pieces, then the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12 pieces."
"First, let's find out how many students are playing volleyball. Since there are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, we can calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:

Number of volleyball players = 2 * Number of tennis players
Number of volleyball players = 2 * 6
Number of volleyball players = 12

Now, we know there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. Since each student only participates in one group, we can add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer to find the total number of students.

Total number of students = Number of tennis players + Number of volleyball players + Number of soccer players
Total number of students = 6 + 12 + (16 + 22)
Total number of students = 6 + 12 + 38
Total number of students = 56

So, the total number of students is 56."
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all the students.

Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students.
So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
So, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
So, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs = 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish = 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils = 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets.

So, the final numerical answer is 47."
"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ slices a day} \]

Now, let's find out how many slices they can eat together in one day. Abby eats 2 slices and Josh eats 4 slices, so together they eat:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ slices a day} \]

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at age 5 and her 10th birthday is when she turns 10 years old. To find out how many months she has been collecting shells, we calculate the difference in years and convert that to months.

From age 5 to 10 is 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months/year:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:

\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Lana has 27 cups of tea in total.
2. She divides these cups into 3 rows equally. So, each row has \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.
3. In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. This means that half of the cups in each row are chamomile and the other half are mint tea.
4. So, in each row, there are \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile and \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.
5. She uses the remaining cups to brew cinnamon tea, and this total is 15 cups. But we don't need this information to find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.5.

The final numerical answer is:
4.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to go down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can calculate the number of trips he can make in 8 hours:
- In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \).

Now, we need to find out how many berries he picks up per trip:
- If he collects 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \).

So, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"First, we need to find out how much water is in the tank. Since the tank has half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of water removed from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ \text{Water remaining in the tank after 6 days} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Colby has spent on popcorn and candy. He bought 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy. The cost of popcorn is $8 per tub and the cost of candy is $2 per box.

Cost of popcorn = 2 * $8 = $16
Cost of candy = 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent on popcorn and candy = $16 + $8 = $24

Now, let's see how much money Colby has left to spend on movie tickets. He started with $150 and has spent $24 on popcorn and candy.

Money left for tickets = $150 - $24 = $126

Now, let's calculate how many tickets he can buy with the remaining $126. Since he can buy tickets for $10 on Fridays and Saturdays and $7 on other days, we need to consider the cost of a movie ticket, which includes popcorn and candy.

Since he already bought popcorn and candy, we can assume he can buy a movie ticket with the remaining money. Let's assume he buys a ticket for $10 (since it's Friday and he can buy tickets for $10 on Fridays and Saturdays).

Number of tickets he can buy = $126 / $10 = 12.6

Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 12 tickets.

Now, let's add the tickets he has already bought. He has already bought 5 tickets on a Friday or Saturday and 8 tickets on other days.

Total tickets already bought = 5 + 8 = 13

Since he can buy 12 more tickets, the total number of tickets he can see is:

Total tickets he can see = 13 (already bought) + 12 (new tickets) = 25

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's find out the calories for a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A mini cinnamon roll has:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A mini blueberry muffin has:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

Total calories for mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ \text{Total calories for mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Total calories for mini blueberry muffins:
\[ \text{Total calories for mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's add the total calories for both types of pastries:
\[ \text{Total calories} = 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85000 \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that number by 5.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day. Since she did this for two days, that's \(78 \times 2 = 156\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up all the Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 156 + 48 + 57\]

First, add 39 and 156:
\[39 + 156 = 195\]

Next, add 48 to the result:
\[195 + 48 = 243\]

Finally, add 57 to the result:
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300. To find the average, we divide the total by 5:
\[300 \div 5 = 60\]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has and then subtract that number from the total number of toys she has now.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

So, the total number of toys Sophie already has is:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48 toys.

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys for her nephew.

To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she has now:
62 (total toys) - 48 (toys already had) = 14 bouncy balls.

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find Paul's age:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

And Peter's age:
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \) years old."
"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons Maria gave to her friends. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Maria also received 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons Maria had initially is:

\[ 2 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Including Maria, there are 5 people in total (4 friends + 1 Maria). So, the total number of additional water balloons given by her mom is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

To find the total number of water balloons the girls had, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons given by her mom:

\[ 2 \text{ (initial balloons)} + 15 \text{ (additional balloons)} = 17 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.
They also have 10 boxes already.

So, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Next, we need to find out how many tables they can use with the 60 boxes if each table can hold 2 boxes.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need.

30 tables needed - 15 tables they already have = 15 new tables needed.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney and then divide by 2 (since there are two people):
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. Since it runs 24 hours a day, it makes:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \]

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Since it also runs 24 hours a day, it makes:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month with 30 days.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these widgets at $6 each.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option.

The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. Since Cameron wants to stay from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, that's a total of 17 hours. However, the first 12 hours are already included in the 24-hour option, so we only need to add the cost for the additional 5 hours.

The cost for each additional hour after the first 12 hours is 70 pesos. So, for 5 additional hours, the cost would be:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding this to the 1600 pesos for the 24-hour stay, the total cost would be:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1950 \text{ pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour option and then adds the cost for the additional 5 hours.

The cost for a 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos. Since Cameron wants to stay for 17 hours, he needs to add the cost for the additional 5 hours. The cost for each additional hour is 70 pesos, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding this to the 1000 pesos for the 12-hour stay, the total cost would be:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, to find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option with the additional hours added, we subtract the total cost of the 12-hour option with additional hours from the total cost of the 24-hour option:
\[ 1950 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 600 \text{ pesos} \]

So, Cameron would save 600 pesos."
"First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. So, twice the amount each goat needs is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than this amount:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know there are 15 goats and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

And there are 12 sheep and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earns $50 an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the gas he spent. He spent $50 on gas, so:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John wants to buy 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining $100. We divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[ 100 \text{ dollars} \div 25 \text{ dollars/pen} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. We know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig and his brother:

Next, we calculate the total number of children for all 5 schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children per school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 280 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all the coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher received from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself.

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost which includes the base visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The base visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is $35 * 2.25.
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ 35 \times 2.25 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add all the costs together:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged $178.75."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Since he gets them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount and then the final cost. The discount amount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, the final cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. The money he gets from selling the 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the money he got from selling the CDs from the final cost he paid:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the yams. Jen has 6 yams and each can be sold for $1.5. So, the total earnings from the yams are:
\[ 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes and each can be sold for $2. So, the total earnings from the sweet potatoes are:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]

Then, let's calculate the earnings from the carrots. Jen has 4 carrots and each can be sold for $1.25. So, the total earnings from the carrots are:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]

Now, we add up all the earnings from the yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots to find the total earnings:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

So, Jen will earn a total of $34 if she sells everything."
"First, let's break down the problem into parts to find out how long it took James to swim across the lake.

1. **Swimming the first 60% of the distance:**
   - The total distance is 20 miles.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \(0.60 \times 20 = 12\) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles is \(12 \div 2 = 6\) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - He rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - The swimming time was 6 hours, so the resting time is \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining 40% of the distance:**
   - The remaining distance is \(20 - 12 = 8\) miles.
   - He swims at half the speed, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) mile per hour.
   - Time to swim 8 miles is \(8 \div 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up all the times:
- Time swimming the first 12 miles: 6 hours
- Time resting: 3 hours
- Time swimming the remaining 8 miles: 8 hours

Total time = \(6 + 3 + 8 = 17\) hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 17 hours."
"First, let's find out what seven times the number of loaves Sam had is. Sam had 70 loaves, so:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, the bakery has 40 less than this amount. So we subtract 40 from 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7, so we subtract 7 from 15:
\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]
Then, she gets 5 more stickers for helping:
\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \]
So, at the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers."
"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times. Each New York Times costs $5 and he gets a 10% commission on each.

\[ \text{Commission per New York Times} = 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 0.5 \]

For 6 copies of the New York Times:

\[ \text{Total commission from New York Times} = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \]

Next, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the Wall Street Journal. Each Wall Street Journal costs $15 and he gets an 8% commission on each.

\[ \text{Commission per Wall Street Journal} = 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 1.2 \]

For 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal:

\[ \text{Total commission from Wall Street Journal} = 10 \times 1.2 = 12 \]

Now, we add the total commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission Cayley earns.

\[ \text{Total commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"If Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, then Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. Therefore, Leo is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be represented as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be represented as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. So we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \( A \):

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the thickness of the book relates to the number of pages.

1. We know that the book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. We also know that 100 pages of paper stack up to 1 inch.
3. Since each page is printed on both sides, each inch of thickness represents 100 pages (because 100 pages on one side and 100 pages on the other side make up the 1 inch).

Now, to find out how many pages are in the book:

- If 1 inch is 100 pages, then 1.5 inches would be:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time into minutes:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Since he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we can find the total number of reports he stapled by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which means she usually sleeps for 8 hours.
2. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
3. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was asleep on the bed:

- From 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. (which is 4 hours and 15 minutes), she was asleep.
- From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. (which is 23 minutes), she was sleepwalking.
- From 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. (which is 3 hours and 17 minutes), she was asleep.

Now, let's add up the time she was asleep on the bed:

- 4 hours and 15 minutes + 3 hours and 17 minutes = 7 hours and 32 minutes.

To convert this into minutes:
- 7 hours = 7 * 60 = 420 minutes
- 420 minutes + 32 minutes = 452 minutes

So, the total number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452 minutes."
"First, let's find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

Now, we calculate the number of measuring spoons he has:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract those from his initial amount:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"First, let's find out how many beds are occupied initially. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied.

\[ \text{Occupied beds initially} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds initially} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we add the patients admitted to the initial number of occupied beds to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's find out how many emails are not work emails. Since Robyn sends sixteen emails a day and seven of them are work emails, we subtract the work emails from the total:

16 - 7 = 9 emails are not work emails.

Out of these 9 emails, two-thirds are sent to family. To find out how many that is, we calculate:

\( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) emails are sent to family.

Now, we subtract the emails sent to family from the non-work emails to find out how many emails are left:

9 - 6 = 3 emails are left.

One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\( \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \) email is sent to her boyfriend.

So, the final numerical answer is 1."
"First, let's find out how old Shawna is. We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old. So, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and she made a mistake of overstating the number by 20%, we need to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

First, let's understand what it means to be overstated by 20%. This means that the number Courtney reported (48) is 120% of the actual number of people. We can set up the equation to find the actual number of people, which we'll call \( x \).

\[ 120\% \text{ of } x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we can convert the percentage to a decimal and solve for \( x \):

\[ 1.20 \times x = 48 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to isolate \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Let's calculate this value.
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls.
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried \(2 \div 2 = 1\) ball.

Now, let's add up all the balls they carried:
- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried 4 balls.
- Jeffrey carried 1 ball.

So, the total number of balls they carried is \(2 + 4 + 1 = 7\).

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.

On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, four times that number is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. So, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 11."
"First, let's understand the distribution of the corn chips. Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than what Amora and Lainey got. So, Collins got:

\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \text{ corn chips} \]

Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is:

\[ 225 \]"
"First, let's find out how much the travel tickets cost. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{50}{100} \times 400 = 0.5 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \) (Together they have caught 339 Pokemon)

First, we can substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

From the first equation, we can express \( X \) in terms of \( S \):
\[ X = S + 5 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( X \) in the third equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Now we substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon. Let's check the answer by calculating the total number of Pokemon caught:
\[ X = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152 \]
\[ A = 40 \]
\[ X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, if each episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.
3. To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is 200."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance the bird travels in each segment of her journey and then sum these distances to find the total distance between her northern and southern homes.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.

She made a batch for herself, which is 1 dozen brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12, she had 12 brownies.

At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies. Since 1/2 dozen equals 6, she received 6 brownies.

When her friends threw her a surprise party, they gave her 4 dozen brownies. Since 4 dozen equals 48, she received 48 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 1/2 dozen equals 18, 18 brownies were eaten.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she received:
12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from the surprise party) = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the brownies that were eaten:
66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 48."
"First, let's find out the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, we can calculate his brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Nani's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out the age of Nani's sister. The sister is 25% younger than Nani. This means she is 75% of Nani's age. We can calculate her age as follows:

\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times \text{Nani's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

So, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."

- For the 3 racquets with synthetic gut, it will take him \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes.
- For the 5 racquets with polyester string, it will take him \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes.
- For the 4 racquets with the hybrid set, it will take him \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes.

Now, let's add up all the time he will spend:

\[45 + 110 + 72 = 227\]

So, the total time it will take Andy to string all of those racquets is 227 minutes."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. John buys 1 phone at full price.
2. He buys 2 phones at half price.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first phone:
- The first phone costs $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the two half-price phones:
- Half price of one phone is $600 / 2 = $300.
- So, two half-price phones cost $300 * 2 = $600.

Now, let's add the cost of the first phone and the two half-price phones:
- Total cost = $600 (first phone) + $600 (two half-price phones) = $1200.

So, the total amount John paid for the phones is $1200."
"Carlton's team has 13 players.
Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.
Combined, both teams have 13 + 20 = 33 players.

The final numerical answer is 33."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence.
2. Determine how many wooden slats are needed based on the perimeter.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substitute the given values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats required:
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's find out how many boxes Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

She originally had 12 boxes, so after giving away 4 boxes, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she gave away 3/4 of the oranges. Since she had 8 boxes left, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she had was 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

The number of oranges she gave away is 3/4 of 160, which is (3/4) * 160 = 120 oranges.

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"To solve this, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the latest data, the USA has 50 states.

Now, let's find out how many states India has. The question states that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we calculate half of the USA's states and then add 4.

Half of the USA's states is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).

Adding 4 to this gives us \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) states in India.

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India:

\( 50 + 29 = 79 \).

So, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy.

The dictionary costs $18.
The dinosaur book costs $13.
The children's cookbook costs $8.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how many boxes of each type of baked good Sunny sold on each day.

On Saturday:
- He sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread, so he sold \(10 - 4 = 6\) boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday:
- He sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

Total gingerbread sold:
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: \(10 + 15 = 25\) boxes

Total apple pie sold:
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: \(6 + 15 = 21\) boxes

Next, we calculate the total earnings from the gingerbread and apple pie.

Earnings from gingerbread:
- Each box of gingerbread costs $6.
- Total gingerbread sold: 25 boxes
- Total earnings from gingerbread: \(25 \times 6 = 150\) dollars

Earnings from apple pie:
- Each box of apple pie costs $15.
- Total apple pie sold: 21 boxes
- Total earnings from apple pie: \(21 \times 15 = 315\) dollars

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings for the two days.

Total earnings:
- Earnings from gingerbread: $150
- Earnings from apple pie: $315
- Total earnings: \(150 + 315 = 465\) dollars

So, Sunny earned a total of 465 dollars for the two days."
"First, let's calculate how much sunscreen Pamela will use in one day. Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and she is outside for 4 hours a day, she will use:

\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much sunscreen she will use over 8 days:

\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we know that her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces she will use by the number of ounces each bottle contains:

\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"First, we need to find out how much cheaper the red car is compared to the blue car. The red car is 40% cheaper, so we calculate 40% of the price of the blue car.

Price of blue car = $100

40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car.

Now, we subtract this amount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.

Price of red car = Price of blue car - $40
Price of red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost.

Total cost = Price of blue car + Price of red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

The final numerical answer is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - When he turns 24, he will be 24 years old.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given conditions:**
   - At that time, Emil's dad will be twice Emil's age.
   - Emil's brother will be half of Emil's age.

3. **Calculate Emil's dad's age when Emil is 24:**
   - Emil's age when he turns 24 = 24 years.
   - Emil's dad's age at that time = 2 * Emil's age at that time = 2 * 24 = 48 years.

4. **Calculate Emil's brother's age when Emil is 24:**
   - Emil's age when he turns 24 = 24 years.
   - Emil's brother's age at that time = 24 / 2 = 12 years.

5. **Determine the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   - Emil's dad is currently 48 years old.
   - Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   - Sum of ages = Emil's dad's age + Emil's brother's age = 48 + 12 = 60 years.

So, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 60 years."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
- Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
- Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which means her friend gave her \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, to find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we add up all the beads she received:

- Beads from mother: 20
- Beads from sister: 30
- Beads from friend: 40

So, the total number of beads is \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\).

The final numerical answer is 90."
"First, let's find out how much crawfish Joe caught on Friday. Since he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, and he caught 3 pounds on Thursday, we can calculate the Friday's catch as follows:

\[ \text{Friday's catch} = 4 \times \text{Thursday's catch} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he caught on Saturday. He caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, so:

\[ \text{Saturday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Friday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up all the crawfish he caught over the three days:

\[ \text{Total catch} = \text{Thursday's catch} + \text{Friday's catch} + \text{Saturday's catch} = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each serving is 3 pounds, we can find out how many servings he has by dividing the total catch by the amount per serving:

\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total catch}}{\text{Pounds per serving}} = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ 12 \]"
"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25 in size.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their shoe sizes together and then divide by 2.

So, the average size is (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the flower bed is measured in feet and the growth of the flowers is in inches, we'll convert everything to inches for consistency.

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Each flower grows 12 inches wide, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches) between every plant. So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
12 inches (plant) + 18 inches (space) = 30 inches

Now, we need to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her 1332 inches long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:
1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can only fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:
44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is:
27 plants * $6/plant = $162

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we divide Edgar's daily consumption by 2:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's daily consumption} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's weekly consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the flowers for one basket:

- Cost of petunias in one basket: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket: 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

So, the total cost for one basket is:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
$14.00/basket * 5 baskets = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Jessica sets aside for fancy shoes each month. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, and she can only spend $500.00 a month on shoes. So, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes she can buy per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can't buy half a pair of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

Now, let's find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes she can buy in a year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate how long it will take her to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can find out how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp and then multiply by the time it takes to saute one set:

\[ \text{Number of sets of 30 shrimp in 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets} \]

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 10 \text{ minutes/set} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute the shrimp to get the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on low for 3 hours. Since it cools the room by 2 degrees an hour, in 3 hours it will cool the room by:
\[ 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on high for 4 hours. Since it cools the room by 3 degrees an hour, in 4 hours it will cool the room by:
\[ 3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was off for 2 hours. Since the room warms up by 2 degrees an hour, in 2 hours it will warm up the room by:
\[ 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the net change in temperature by adding the cooling from the low setting and the high setting, and then subtracting the warming from the off setting:
\[ 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the room was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature after the air conditioner was turned off. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine how old Bill's father was when he saw the comet. We know that Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time. According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it. Since his father was 30 years old, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we need to find out how many years passed between the first and second sightings of the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we subtract the 75 years from his age when he saw it the second time:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, let's break down his monthly check writing habits:

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Church: 2 checks per month
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check every quarter (which is 3 months)

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year:

- Electric bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Gas bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Church: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check/3 months * 12 months/year = 4 checks/year

Now, let's add them all up:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The first plane makes 44 trips in total (since 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes).
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the number of trips to Greece, France, and Germany:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) times.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Since the total number of flights is 88, the remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\).
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

So, the first plane takes 66 flights to Greece, 11 flights to France, and 11 flights to Germany in one day.

The final numerical answer is:
66"
"First, let's determine how long each wolf howls.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl time} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl time} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's add up the total time for all three wolves:
\[ \text{Total howl time} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Total howl time in minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount his mother and father gave him from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children, so the average age is:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age of the children}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so Helene's age is:

\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's denote Wilfred's age as \( W \). The total age of the children is the sum of their individual ages:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + W \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ 20 = 17 + W \]
\[ W = 20 - 17 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

So, Wilfred's age is 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:
- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Now, Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much the lawyer will donate, we need to know how much everyone else has donated. Walter's friend is going to give him $200, which means everyone else has donated $200.

So, the lawyer's donation will be:
$200 * 3 = $600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $600."
"First, we need to find out the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider how the watermelon is divided among the family members. Let's assume the watermelon is divided into 6 slices, one for each person in the family.

Given that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the slices as follows:
- Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \).
- Then, the size of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2x + 4 \text{ (kids)} \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

However, we know the watermelon is divided into 6 slices. This means the total slices (8x) must equal 6 slices. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 8x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now, we know each kid's slice is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a slice. Each adult's slice is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2} \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to calculate:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{\text{Each adult's slice}}{\text{Total slices}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{6} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{6} = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \]

So, the percentage is:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on checking on the inpatients. He spends 20 minutes per inpatient and there are 9 inpatients, so:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} \times 9 \text{ inpatients} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he spends on appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, so:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} \times 10 \text{ appointments} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time spent on inpatients and appointments:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's add up all the time required to make and prepare the cake:

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add these times together:

20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the total time required to make and prepare the cake. To find out the latest time Jordan can start, we need to subtract this total time from the time the cake needs to be ready, which is 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm is 5:00 in the afternoon. To convert this to minutes past midnight, we have:
- 5:00 pm = 17:00
- 17:00 = 17 * 60 = 1020 minutes past midnight

Now, subtract the total time required from 1020 minutes:

1020 minutes - 180 minutes = 840 minutes

Now, convert 840 minutes back to hours and minutes:
- 840 minutes = 14 hours

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 14:00, which is 2:00 pm.

The latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to determine the total number of boxes they sold together.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So together they sold:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

So, the number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total earnings from the dance studio's lessons in a month. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session**: $25
2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Number of sessions per week**: 3
5. **Number of weeks in a month**: Assume 4 weeks for simplicity.

First, calculate the cost per session for 10 students:
\[ \text{Cost per session} = \$25 + (10 \times \$1.50) = \$25 + \$15 = \$40 \]

Next, calculate the total earnings per week:
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = \$40 \times 3 = \$120 \]

Finally, calculate the total earnings for the month:
\[ \text{Total earnings for the month} = \$120 \times 4 = \$480 \]

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes Peter has:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes Martha has:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Total babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Now, we add the babies born in a year to the original population to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of water are needed. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's find out how many students are over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16 years old, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \]

Next, we find out how many of these students over 16 are male. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \]

So, the number of female students over 16 years old is:

\[ \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125 \]

Now, let's find out how many students are under 16 years old. Since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Students under 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \]

Next, we find out how many of these students under 16 are male. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

So, the number of female students under 16 years old is:

\[ \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750 \]

Finally, to find the total number of female students enrolled at the school, we add the number of female students over 16 and the number of female students under 16:

\[ \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875 \]

So, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

5"
"First, let's calculate how much water Wanda and Ms. B filled into the tank on the first day.

On the first day:
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.

So, the total amount of water filled on the first day is \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

On the second day:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days is \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Condition**: Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank was 100%.
2. **First 5 Hours**: The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 1 hour, the charge is 91% (100% - 9%). After 2 hours, it's 82% (91% - 9%). After 3 hours, it's 73% (82% - 9%). After 4 hours, it's 64% (73% - 9%). After 5 hours, it's 55% (64% - 9%).
3. **Next 3 Hours**: After 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its charge each hour. So, after 6 hours, the charge is 48% (55% - 7%). After 7 hours, it's 41% (48% - 7%). After 8 hours, it's 34% (41% - 7%).

Now, we know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 48%.

The final numerical answer is:
48%"
"First, let's calculate how much Janet earns in a week. She earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Janet wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment. So, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the amount left for plums is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's find out the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has. She has 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. So, the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

She gave these 13 packs to her 10 friends equally. So, each friend received:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs/friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, each friend received:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the price increase year by year. The price increases by 5% each year, so we can use the formula for compound interest to find the price after three years. The formula is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial price is $120, the rate is 5% or 0.05, and the number of years is 3. Plugging in these values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many pictures were put into each album. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album by dividing 72 by 8.

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures. Now, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. This means the remaining albums are not selfies or portraits, but since we are only asked about selfies and portraits, we can ignore these.

Now, we calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:

- Number of selfies = Number of selfies-only albums = 3
- Number of portraits = Number of portrait-only albums = 2

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits Olivia has is 5."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \approx 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \]

Now, James reads 18 pages. To find out how long he spends reading, we multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to read one page:

\[ \text{Total reading time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \]

\[ \text{Total reading time} = 59.94 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends approximately 59.94 minutes reading."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
- 24 guests checked out early.
- 15 guests checked out late.
- Twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is 30 guests.
- 7 more people checked in after dinner.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests after each event:

1. After 24 guests checked out early, the number of guests is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]

2. After 15 guests checked out late, the number of guests is:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]

3. After 30 guests checked in (twice as many as those who checked out late):
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]

4. After 7 more guests checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add up the bananas he picked each day.

On Wednesday, he picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, we add the bananas from each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

So, the final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz.

- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, the number of easy questions she is sure to get is:
- Easy questions she is sure to get: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions

She is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get is:
- Average and difficult questions she is sure to get: 50% of 36 = 0.50 * 36 = 18 questions

Now, let's add up the questions she is sure to get:
- Total questions she is sure to get: 18 (easy) + 18 (average and difficult) = 36 questions

So, the final numerical answer is 36."
"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large ones cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's say Teresa sold \( x \) large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals.

The total earnings from the large stuffed animals are:
\[ 12x \text{ dollars} \]

The total earnings from the small stuffed animals are:
\[ 4 \times 2x = 8x \text{ dollars} \]

The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) small stuffed animals.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total money Suzanne earned from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so the money from cookies is:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so the money from cupcakes is:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add the money from cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to subtract the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Now, we subtract the $20 given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. If there were 100 eggs hidden in total and 10 were not found, then 100 - 10 = 90 eggs were found. Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the friends found 90 - 60 = 30 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. We know that with an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine twice as much as with his bare hands, and with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.

1 dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds/day} \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds/day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine:
\[ 24 \text{ pounds/day} \times 1.5 = 36 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

The total amount of ore one dwarf can mine in a month with a steel pickaxe is:
\[ 36 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

For 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined in a month is:
\[ 1080 \text{ pounds} \times 40 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 43200 \]"
"To solve this, we need to find the price for the package with 8 sandwiches based on the given prices for the other packages. We know the prices are proportional, so we can set up a ratio.

For the first package:
- 2 sandwiches cost $3.

For the second package:
- 4 sandwiches cost $6.

For the third package:
- 8 sandwiches cost an unknown price, let's call it \( x \).

Since the prices are proportional, the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the cost should be the same for all packages. So, we can set up the following ratios:

For the first package:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ sandwiches}}{3 \text{ dollars}} \]

For the second package:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ sandwiches}}{6 \text{ dollars}} \]

For the third package:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ sandwiches}}{x \text{ dollars}} \]

Since the ratios are proportional, we can write:
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{8}{x} \]

We can simplify the ratio \(\frac{4}{6}\) to \(\frac{2}{3}\), which matches the first ratio. So, we can use the first ratio to find \( x \):
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{x} \]

To find \( x \), we can cross-multiply:
\[ 2x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 2x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{2} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Tom has left to pay after selling his old bedroom and using the money to pay for part of the new bedroom set.

Tom sold his old bedroom for $1000 and used that money to pay part of the new bedroom set. The new bedroom set costs $3000, so after using $1000, he still needs to pay:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 per month. To find out how much he has to pay each month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate how many red balloons burst. Sally started with 25 red balloons and 40% of them burst. So, the number of red balloons that burst is:

\[ 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

This means the number of red balloons left is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She started with 12 yellow balloons, so the number of yellow balloons released is:

\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

This means the number of yellow balloons left is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. The number of blue balloons she added is:

\[ 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, green, and yellow balloons plus the blue balloons she added:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 34 \]

Therefore, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

"To solve this, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. The probability that the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension is 40%, or 0.4.
2. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment, or 0.2.
3. The remaining probability is that Marcus will have to turn in his homework. This is the probability that the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, which is 60% (100% - 40%), or 0.6.

So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 60%, or 0.6.

"First, we need to find out how many seats are left after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

Seats reserved for graduates: 950
Seats reserved for faculty: 300

Total reserved seats = Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Total seats available = 6000

Seats available for graduates and their guests = Total seats available - Total reserved seats
Seats available for graduates and their guests = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to split these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates.

Seats per graduate = Seats available for graduates and their guests / Number of graduates
Seats per graduate = 4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's figure out how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and he can eat 75 large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as follows:

\[ \text{Number of medium-sized beans} = 2 \times \text{Number of large beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Next, we need to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. We know that 3 small beans are the same as 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

\[ \text{Number of small beans} = 150 \times 3 = 450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total pay for the 3 days. She is paid $15 per day, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total pay:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total pay after expenses by the total hours she spent on jury duty:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place along his driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

\[ \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the seventh to the eighth), he will need to make 7 trips. Each trip takes 5 seconds, so we calculate the total time as follows:

\[ \text{Total time} = 7 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds/trip} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Mo buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- So, the cost for Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Mo buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- So, the cost for mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \).

Now, let's add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of mozzarella
- Total cost = \$22 + \$18 = \$40.

Mo starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
- Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
- Money left = \$50 - \$40 = \$10.

Next, let's determine his income after college. His original income was $25,000 a year, and his income tripled, so his new income is:
\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college and not worked during his 4 years of college. His original income was $25,000 a year, so in 4 years, he would have earned:
\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

However, during those 4 years, he also borrowed $200,000. So, the total amount of money he has to pay back is the sum of the money he earned and the money he borrowed:
\[ 100,000 + 200,000 = 300,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate how long it would take him to earn $300,000 at his new income of $75,000 a year. We do this by dividing the total amount he needs to earn by his new annual income:
\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

The new length of the fabric will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

The new width of the fabric will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to calculate the area of one piece of fabric. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

So, the area of one piece of fabric is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total number of square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ 160 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that on Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

Next, we need to find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery was 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. So, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85 \]
Then, we add 17 to this amount to get Tuesday's delivery:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]
So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

Now, we need to find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery was 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery. So, we first calculate twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]
Then, we add 5 to this amount to get Wednesday's delivery:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]
So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the deliveries for each day:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad. There are 10 people who want the chicken salad and it costs $6.50 per person. So, the total cost for the chicken salad is:
\[ 10 \times 6.50 = 65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad. There are 6 people who want the pasta salad and it costs $6 per person. So, the total cost for the pasta salad is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total amount Molly will pay:
\[ 65 + 36 = 101 \]

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is:
\[ 101 \]"
"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's determine the amount lost in each race:

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - $1 more than this amount: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - 1.5 times the amount won in the second race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   So, Johnny's dad lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $11 (he won, so this is a gain, not a loss)
- Third race: $16.5 (he lost)

Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3

Average amount lost per race = \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

Rounding to two decimal places, the average amount lost per race is $7.17.

So, the final numerical answer is:
7.17"
"To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Number of people in each city = 1000

Total number of people = Number of countries × Number of cities in each country × Number of people in each city
Total number of people = 26 × 5 × 1000

Now let's calculate this:
Total number of people = 26 × 5 × 1000 = 130,000

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for this calculation.

Xavier was 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount they took together is $1920. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 420 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many days the painters worked in total. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days they worked is:

\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days they worked in 3/8ths of a day. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day each day, we multiply the total number of days by 3/8:

\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to convert the total work hours into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the total number of days worked by 24:

\[ \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} \text{ hours} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{63 \times 24}{8} = \frac{63 \times 3}{1} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked:

\[ \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

So, we can write the equation for the total number of balls as:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's calculate the value at the end of each year:

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   - Value at the end of 2007: $20000
   - Value at the end of 2008: $20000 * 0.79 = $15800

2. **2008 to 2009:**
   - Value at the end of 2008: $15800
   - Value at the end of 2009: $15800 * 0.79 = $12442

3. **2009 to 2010:**
   - Value at the end of 2009: $12442
   - Value at the end of 2010: $12442 * 0.79 = $9750.98

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9750.98."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we find out how many books are written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find out how many books are written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Spanish books} = 50 - \text{English books} - \text{German books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate how far she has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. Now, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance to New York City.

Total distance to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance already driven: 325 kilometers

Distance still needed = Total distance - Distance already driven
Distance still needed = 1955 - 325
Distance still needed = 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days. Since she drinks 8 cups a day, we multiply 8 by 30:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total cups into gallons. We know that 1 gallon equals 16 cups. So, we divide the total cups by 16 to get the total gallons:

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 15 gallons."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:** 120 people.
2. **At the first stop:** 20 more people board the train.
   - New number of people: \( 120 + 20 = 140 \) people.
3. **At the second stop:** 50 people disembark and twice that number (which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \)) board the train.
   - People after disembarking: \( 140 - 50 = 90 \) people.
   - People after boarding: \( 90 + 100 = 190 \) people.
4. **At the third stop:** 80 more people disembark.
   - Final number of people: \( 190 - 80 = 110 \) people.

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"First, let's break down the costs of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: The original price was $48, but they were on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: The original price was $8, but with a $2 off coupon, the cost is $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Tank top: $10
Running shorts: $15
Tennis shoes: $24
Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find out how many tiles you need, you first need to know the area of one tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of one tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt.

Your kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt, so you will need 200 tiles (since each tile covers 1 SqFt).

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

So, the final numerical answer is $2400."
"First, we need to find out how much the insurance cost after the accident. Since the cost increased by 60% and the normal cost is $120 a month, we can calculate the increase as follows:

\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the cost after the accident is:

\[ \text{New Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2304 \]"
"First, let's determine how many sets of sheets Greg needs to wash each week. A twin set of sheets consists of 2 twin beds, so 4 twin beds would be 2 twin sets. Adding the 1 king size bed, he needs to wash 2 + 1 = 3 sets of sheets each week.

The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time. Since 3 sets of sheets need to be washed each week, Greg will need to do 2 loads of laundry for the twin sets (2 twin sets / 2 twin sets per load) and 1 load for the king set. So, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry each week.

Now, to find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we need to multiply the weekly loads by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

So, the final numerical answer is 156."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
2. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday. So, on Sunday, they watch \(4 \div 2 = 2\) movies.
3. In one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch \(4 + 2 = 6\) movies.
4. Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will have 4 weekends.
5. Therefore, in 4 weeks, they can watch \(6 \times 4 = 24\) movies.

The final numerical answer is 24."
"To find out how many stickers Leo has now, let's break down the information given:

- Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
- Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
- This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year (which was 50 last year).

So, this year Leo collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stickers Leo has now:

- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 100 (from two years ago) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers
- This year: 150 (from last year) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers

Therefore, the final number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250."
"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day.

Since Imma has 3 cats and they each get 60 grams of food twice a day, we can calculate the daily food consumption as follows:

\[ \text{Daily food consumption} = 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} \]

\[ \text{Daily food consumption} = 3 \times 60 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Daily food consumption} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cat food}}{\text{Daily food consumption}} \]

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} \]

\[ \text{Number of days} = 2 \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. We know that Becky ate 10 slices and that she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, if we let the number of slices Jake ate be \( J \), then:

\[ 10 = J + 3 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

So, Jake ate 7 slices. Now, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, if we let the number of slices Silvia ate be \( S \), then:

\[ S = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ S = 14 \]

So, Silvia ate 14 slices. Now, we can find the total number of slices they all ate by adding the slices each person ate:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 31 \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for both parts is 98 minutes. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side gives:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes. To find out how long Betsy's part took, we add 18 minutes to Donovan's time:

\[ Betsy's\ part = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300 per hour for a visit. Since the visit is only 30 minutes, we need to convert this to hours. 30 minutes is half an hour, so the cost for the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4 each is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

To find 80% of 80 emails:
\[ 80\% \times 80 = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day.

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5 day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 2 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 3 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add them all up:

- Monday: 32
- Tuesday: 64
- Wednesday: 96
- Thursday: 30
- Friday: 25

Total = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

Let's add these numbers:

32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

He scored:
- 100 on his first test
- 100 on his second test
- 100 on his third test
- 80 on his fourth test

First, we add up all the scores:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 20 \times 0.7 = 14 \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ordered. They ordered twice as many as the glee club, so:

\[ \text{Pizzas ordered by football team} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the football team has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = \text{Pizzas left with glee club} + \text{Pizzas left with football team} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons together:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

This means Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of meatball sub sandwiches left with Sidney is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

After that, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"First, let's determine how many trucks had mechanical failures. Mr. Hezekiah originally had 20 trucks, and a quarter of them had failures.

\[
\text{Number of trucks with failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means that the remaining trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser. To find the number of trucks that successfully delivered, we subtract the number of trucks with failures from the total number of trucks.

\[
\text{Number of trucks that delivered} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the amount of fertiliser each truck carried.

\[
\text{Total tons of fertiliser delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300
\]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need:
   6 dozen croissants * 1 pound of butter/dozen croissants = 6 pounds of butter

2. The store has a promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

3. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter. To find out how many sets of 2 pounds he can get, we divide:
   6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets

4. For each set of 2 pounds, he only pays for 1 pound. So, for 3 sets, he will pay:
   3 sets * 1 pound per set = 3 pounds of butter

5. The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, for 3 pounds, the cost will be:
   3 pounds * $4.00 per pound = $12.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people invited to the party:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.

Now, let's find out how many people will actually come to the party. Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of people attending will be:

- Total invited - People who can't come = 45 - 4 = 41 people.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 people, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since 20 people are already covered by the base fee, we need to calculate the cost for the additional 21 people (41 - 20 = 21).

The cost for the additional guests is:
- $6 per guest * 21 guests = $126.

Now, we add the base rental fee to the additional cost:
- Base rental fee = $125
- Additional cost = $126

Total cost = Base rental fee + Additional cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

So, the party will cost Kayla $251."
"Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent $60 / 4 = $15. So, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent $60 / 3 = $20. So, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85 left.

The final numerical answer is $85."
"First, let's find out how many bananas the first monkey eats in a week. Since the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, in a week (7 days) it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]

In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, let's find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week. The total number of bananas is 315, and we know the first and second monkeys eat 70 and 98 bananas respectively in a week. So, the third monkey eats:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 70 \text{ bananas} - 98 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the third monkey eats the same number of bananas each day, we divide the total number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week by 7:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of the first puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces of the first puzzle.
Teddy also finished the second puzzle, which means he placed 500 pieces of the second puzzle.
So, in total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so:

\[ 5 \text{ bills} \times \$5/\text{bill} = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she gets in change.

The change she gets is:

\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she gets in change is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters."
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes. He sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so:

\[ 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \]

Next, let's calculate the total money he makes from selling burger platters. He sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so:

\[ 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

Then, let's calculate the total money he makes from selling sodas. He sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so:

\[ 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \]

Now, we add up all the money he makes from each item to find the total amount of money he makes:

\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:

\[ 162 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the schedule of the trains and calculate the time Paul will wait.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves after 10 minutes, so it arrives in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves after 60 minutes, so it arrives in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it arrives at 65 minutes and leaves at 65 minutes.
   - The third train stays in the station for 5 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 65 minutes and arrives at 65 minutes, so it stays for 5 minutes.
   - The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so it arrives at 65 + 20 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's determine how long Paul will wait for his train:

- The first train arrives in 10 minutes, and Paul will wait until it leaves in 20 minutes.
- The second train arrives in 60 minutes, and Paul will wait until it leaves in 5 minutes.
- The third train arrives in 65 minutes, and Paul will wait until it leaves in 5 minutes.
- The fourth train arrives in 85 minutes, and Paul will wait until it leaves.

So, Paul will wait for 85 minutes for his train.

The final numerical answer is:
85"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

If Melanie continues saving 10 toothpicks each week, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks.

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch was $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold it for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend got from the original price. The original price was $2000, and he bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per second for one spring:**
   - One spring creates one jellyfish every second.

2. **Calculate the rate of jellyfish creation per second for five springs:**
   - If one spring creates one jellyfish per second, then five springs would create five jellyfish per second.

3. **Convert 4 hours into seconds:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute.
   - So, 4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds.

4. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by five springs in 4 hours:**
   - If five springs create five jellyfish per second, then in 14400 seconds, they would create 5 * 14400 jellyfish.

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 5 \times 14400 = 72000 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish created by five springs in 4 hours is 72000."
"To solve this, we first need to understand the relationship between Frankie's and Binkie's scores. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is given as 90.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"First, let's break down the journey James made:

1. James walks halfway to the store. Since the store is 4 miles away, halfway is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
2. He realizes he forgot something and has to walk back home. So, he walks another 2 miles back to his home.
3. After getting what he forgot, he walks the full 4 miles to the store.

So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 8 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 2 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many bananas Jenny bought in total. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of buying these bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, the total cost would be:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

We also know that the total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine its growth rate per year. If the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, then the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 26 inches."
"First, let's find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold.

- Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
  \[
  \frac{300}{2} = 150
  \]

- 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes. So, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
  \[
  0.15 \times 300 = 45
  \]

- The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. So, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
  \[
  300 - 150 - 45 = 105
  \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike sold.

- The price of one MTB is $500. So, the total earnings from MTB bikes are:
  \[
  105 \times 500 = 52500
  \]

- The price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is:
  \[
  \frac{500}{2} = 250
  \]
  So, the total earnings from BMX bikes are:
  \[
  45 \times 250 = 11250
  \]

- The price of one Trekking bike is $450. So, the total earnings from Trekking bikes are:
  \[
  150 \times 450 = 67500
  \]

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the bikes to find the total earnings for the month:
\[
52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250
\]

So, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"First, let's calculate how many bales the farmer makes in a day. Since the farmer makes 5 bales each hour and works for 6 hours, the total number of bales made by the farmer in a day is:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

Next, let's calculate how many bales the truck picks up in a day. Since the truck picks up 3 bales each hour and works for 6 hours, the total number of bales picked up by the truck in a day is:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has to take each day. Normally, there are 6 periods, but John has to take 2 extra classes. So, he has:

\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ periods per day} \]

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total time John spends in class each day is:

\[ 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes per day} \]

John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total time he spends in class each week is:

\[ 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes per week} \]

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. So, the total extra learning time per week is:

\[ \frac{1600}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra learning time to the time spent in class to get the total time spent learning each week:

\[ 1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes per week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 28.33 \text{ hours per week} \]"
"First, let's calculate the height of the third-floor balcony. Since each story is 24 feet high, the third-floor balcony is 3 stories high. So, the height of the third-floor balcony is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

When the ball bounces, it reaches 2/3 of its previous height. So, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again reach 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, the height on the second bounce is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's convert everything to inches because the differences are given in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, the first child is:
6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"First, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings. The orchard sells each bag for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1000 \]"
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \( x \) kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of it, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
3. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they left \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
4. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
1080"
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall. So, the area of one of these walls is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall. So, the area of one of these walls is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add up the total area of all four walls:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are needed. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \] gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \] dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial conditions and the changes made to the sodas.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 sodas, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
3. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
4. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

Initially, there are 2 shaken sodas out of a total of 7 sodas (8 unshaken - 1 taken by Ellen + 2 unshaken - 2 taken by Ellen's brother = 7 sodas).

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{7} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{2}{7} \times 100 \approx 28.57\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 28.57%."
"First, let's determine the speed of each train. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so its speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of second train} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, their speeds add up when calculating the distance between them. So, the combined speed at which they are moving apart is:

\[ \text{Combined speed} = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how far apart they are after 3 hours. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Distance} = 90 \times 3 = 270 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 270 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days, so the total number of days is:

31 (days in March) + 19 (days in April) = 50 days

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works on 80% of the days. To find out how many days he works, we calculate:

50 days * 80% = 50 days * 0.8 = 40 days

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he can help in one day is:

2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Now, to find out how many people he helps in 40 days, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:

6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

So, the final numerical answer is 240 people."
"First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses. Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses, so the total number of people in the buses is:
\[ 12 \times 35 = 420 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars. Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 cars, so the total number of people in the cars is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars:
\[ 420 + 60 = 480 \]

So, the total number of people inside the church is:
\[ 480 \]"
"First, let's find out how old Martha is. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20 years old

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 years to Martha's age:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30 years old

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"First, we need to calculate how long it takes to slide down each waterslide.

For the biggest waterslide:
- Length = 300 feet
- Speed = 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest waterslide:
- Length = 240 feet
- Speed = 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.
- Difference in time = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
- Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks each day.

He takes a 30-minute lunch break and 2 breaks of 15 minutes each day. 

So, the total break time per day is:
30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 60 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many hours this total break time adds up to after 5 days.

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the total break time per day is 1 hour.

After 5 days, the total break time is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items after the returns and purchases.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so the charge on her card is reduced by $15.00.

\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is:

\[ 20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]

So, the frying pan cost:

\[ 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

Then, she bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount on the towels is:

\[ 30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00 \]

So, the towels cost:

\[ 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance on her credit card:

\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on her credit card is:

\[ 113.00 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

Out of these large jellyfish, a third change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final numerical answer is:
90"
"First, let's find out how old Ben is. Since Ben is two times older than Chris and Chris is 4 years old, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year, so:

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 20\% \times \$100,000 = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of her salary she will live on each year, which is 40% of her current salary:

\[ \text{Annual living expenses} = 40\% \times \$100,000 = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000 \]

Since Lauren saves $20,000 each year but spends $40,000 each year, she is actually spending $20,000 more than she saves each year. This means she is not saving enough to cover her living expenses and will need to work more years to save enough for retirement.

To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate how many years it will take for her to save enough to cover her living expenses for 20 years. We can do this by dividing her annual living expenses by her annual savings:

\[ \text{Years needed to save for living expenses} = \frac{\text{Annual living expenses}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$40,000}{\$20,000} = 2 \text{ years} \]

So, Lauren needs to work 2 more years to save enough to live on for 20 years. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"To find out how long each final cut will be, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters}
   \]
   So, each of the final cuts will be 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
5
\]"
"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"First, let's add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
- Pots: $19
- Sack of garden soil: $26

So, $19 + $26 = $45

Now, she used a coupon for $7 off:
- Total cost before coupon: $45
- Amount of coupon: $7

So, $45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, the final amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add the heights of all the heels together and then divide by the total number of heels.

There are 3 heels that are 4 inches tall and 3 heels that are 2 inches tall. So, we add these together:

\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18 \) inches

There are a total of 6 heels. To find the average, we divide the total height by the number of heels:

\( \frac{18}{6} = 3 \) inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"First, let's find out how many miles Soledad plans to hike in a day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day.

She wants to hike a total of 9,300 miles in June. To find out how many days are in June, we know that June has 30 days.

Soledad needs to hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Now, to find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to reach her goal of 310 miles per day, we subtract the number of miles she plans to hike per day from the number of miles she needs to hike per day.

Soledad needs to hike 310 miles per day and she plans to hike 250 miles per day, so she needs to hike 310 - 250 = 60 more miles per day.

The final numerical answer is 60 miles per day."
"First, let's find out how many balls there are in total:
- Red balls: 3
- Blue balls: 11
- Green balls: 25

Total number of balls = 3 + 11 + 25 = 39 balls

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for each color of ball:
- Cost of red balls: 3 red balls * $9 per red ball = $27
- Cost of blue balls: 11 blue balls * $5 per blue ball = $55
- Cost of green balls: 25 green balls * $3 per green ball = $75

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the balls:
Total cost = $27 (red) + $55 (blue) + $75 (green) = $157

So, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's find out how much apples each person wants.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg:
\[ \text{Peter's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's add up the shares of Peter and Paul:
\[ \text{Total shared by Peter and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since they bought 12 kg in total, the amount left for James is:
\[ \text{James's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"The temperature dropped by 8 degrees, so we subtract 8 from the initial 2 degrees:
\[ 2 - 8 = -6 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Then it increased by 3 degrees in the morning, so we add 3 to -6:
\[ -6 + 3 = -3 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

The temperature in the morning was \(-3\) degrees Celsius."
"First, let's calculate how much Raymond had after saving from his allowance:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, let's subtract the amount he spent on the comic book and the puzzle:
\[ 32 - 5 - 19 = 32 - 24 = 8 \]

So, Raymond has $8 left."
"First, let's find out how much money Anna has left after her purchases. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left, so she has spent:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

She had already spent $4 before buying the books today, so the amount she spent on the books today is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books today, and both books cost the same amount. So, to find out the cost of each book, we divide the total amount spent on books by 2:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost Anna $5."
"To find out how many students are enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the increase in enrollment, which is 20% of last year's enrollment. Last year, there were 50 students enrolled.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students. To find the total enrollment this year, we add this increase to last year's enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"First, we need to find out how many times the light blinks in one minute. Since it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate of blinking per minute by dividing 255 by 5.

\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we want to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing 459 by the rate of blinking we just found.

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after buying more.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

He buys:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfishes
- 3 more female goldfishes

Now, let's add the new ones to the initial count:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:
- Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16
- Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11

Now, subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference: 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes. The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia's chore was mowing the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

Megan's chore was walking the dog, and it took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. So, Megan's time is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Dior's chore was doing laundry, and it took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]
(Note: ""well over 4 hours longer"" means more than 4 hours, so we can use 5 hours as a reasonable estimate for this problem.)

Now, we add up the time each person took to do their chores:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's find out the distance John drives one way. We know that speed is distance over time, so distance is speed times time. John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to drive there. So, the distance one way is:

\[ \text{Distance one way} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, he makes two round trips each month. A round trip means driving to his parents and back, so the round trip distance is:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance John drives in a month is:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 280 \]"
"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, she will walk a total of 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles in 7 days.

According to the question, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if we let the distance Brian walks in 7 days be \( B \) miles, then we have:
\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The final numerical answer is:
35"
"First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour} \]

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Now, let's add the production rates of all four workers:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Since they all work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they had 200 toys produced. So, the number of toys still needed to be produced is:
\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

Since the fifth worker is also working for a 10-hour shift, let's denote the production rate of the fifth worker as \( x \) toys per hour. The total production of the fifth worker in 10 hours is:
\[ 10x \text{ toys} \]

The total number of toys produced by all five workers in 10 hours is:
\[ 200 + 10x \]

We know that the total number of toys produced by all five workers must be 400, so:
\[ 200 + 10x = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 10x = 400 - 200 \]
\[ 10x = 200 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, the fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out the weight of Elijah's dogs.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would be:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would be:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up the weights of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Seth originally had \( S \) stickers.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
4. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he gave away to Rob, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \).
5. Simplifying the equation, we get \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
6. To find \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&Ms are in 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&M has 30 M&Ms. So, for 30 ounces:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ 900 \text{ M&Ms} \div 10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"First, let's find out how fast the 2nd fastest car is. We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.

So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25 to find the speed of the faster car.

The speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the faster car goes at a speed of 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this, let's first figure out Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ years old} \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find out how old Vince is now, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call the number of eggs each painted \( A \). So, Arnold painted \( A \) eggs and Madeline painted \( A \) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted \( S \). So, Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs because Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   2A + 2S + 12 = 56
   \]
   Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   2A + 2S = 44
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   A + S = 22
   \]
4. We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs:
   \[
   S + (S + 12) = 30
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   2S + 12 = 30
   \]
   Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   2S = 18
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   S = 9
   \]
5. Now we can find \( A \) using \( A + S = 22 \):
   \[
   A + 9 = 22
   \]
   Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[
   A = 13
   \]
6. Camden painted \( S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.
7. To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted:
   \[
   21 - 13 = 8
   \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. We do this by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per group:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Next, we need to find out the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes to get the combined weight:

\[ \text{Total combined weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total combined weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16:

\[ \text{Total combined weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

\[ \text{Length of logs} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we determine how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we find out how many planks he can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ \text{Number of planks} = 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we calculate how much he makes by selling each plank for $1.2:

\[ \text{Total money made} = 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

To find the brother's salary, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month.

Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. The problem states that their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they all have together. We add up Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach part of her walk is 2 miles long. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we can write the equation for the time spent on the beach as:
\[ v \times 40 = 2 \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we know that Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk. So, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk part of her walk is 1 mile long. The time spent walking on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both parts of her walk to find the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 + 10 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 every week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves each week:

\[ 28 \, \text{dollars} \div 4 \, \text{dollars/week} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees with 7 blue birds each. There are 3 such trees, so:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees with 4 blue birds each. There are 2 such trees, so:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, there is 1 tree with 3 blue birds, so:

\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add up all the blue birds from each tree:

\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob originally has. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12 marbles, 2 dozen equals 24 marbles. So, if he gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means he originally has:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final number of marbles Bob will have is 26."
"First, let's understand the problem. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is an unknown temperature, which we'll call \( T \) degrees. He pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. After this, he is able to drink the water, meaning the temperature of the water in his water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \). After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, the temperature of the water in the water bottle can be calculated as follows:

The temperature of the water in the water bottle after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug is:
\[ \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + T}{5} \]

We know that this temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]
\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 68 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of days in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks would be:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of cows Melanie's father gets from Milkie Cows Limited in 21 days. Since he gets 20 cows per day, in 21 days he will get:
\[ 20 \times 21 = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Initially, he had 50 cows. After 21 days, the total number of cows will be:
\[ 50 + 420 = 470 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens Melanie's father gets from Broilers Limited in 21 days. Since he gets 10 chickens per day, in 21 days he will get:
\[ 10 \times 21 = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Initially, he had 20 chickens. After 21 days, the total number of chickens will be:
\[ 20 + 210 = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we add the total number of cows and chickens:
\[ 470 + 230 = 700 \]

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs would cost:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since Russell gets a 10% discount for ordering 4 packs, we need to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the total cost. A 10% discount on $40.00 is:

\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, each single bagel will cost $1.00. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The question states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. The number of scoops is 1 less than 3, which is:

\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The question also states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. So we calculate:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion since the number of potatoes needed is directly proportional to the number of scoops:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add the total number of eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out how many red jelly beans there are. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

Number of red jelly beans = 2 * Number of green jelly beans
Number of red jelly beans = 2 * 17
Number of red jelly beans = 34

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

Number of blue jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans - (Number of green jelly beans + Number of red jelly beans)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jelly beans = 9

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 9."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of lemons Tim collects over a decade (10 years).

First, we find out how many lemons he gets from one tree in one year:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} \]

Next, we calculate the number of lemons from one tree in 10 years:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 60 \text{ lemons/tree/decade} \]

Now, we need to find out how many lemons he gets from all 5 trees in 10 years:
\[ 60 \text{ lemons/tree/decade} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 300 \text{ lemons/decade} \]

So, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
\[ 300 \]"
"First, let's find out how many men and women are on the bus initially.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

If the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide this number by the total parts of the ratio to find out how many passengers each part represents:
\[ \text{Passengers per part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find out how many men and women are on the bus initially:
- Number of men = 5 parts * 6 passengers per part = 30 men
- Number of women = 9 parts * 6 passengers per part = 54 women

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ \text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. Since each sunflower costs $2, and he earned $26 from the sunflowers, we can calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings by the price per sunflower:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\$26}{\$2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets of sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquets, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the total earnings from the bouquets by the price per bouquet:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold in one day from the bouquets is:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers from bouquets per day} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers per bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, we add the number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets to the number of sunflowers sold individually to find the total number of sunflowers sold per day:

\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = 13 \text{ sunflowers} + 84 \text{ sunflowers} = 97 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 291 \text{ sunflowers} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 291."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks. If he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam initially had $100. After selling the rocks, he has $84. The loss is the difference between what he had initially and what he has left:

\[ \text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

So, Adam loses $16."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how many days it will take Lauren to draw all the scenes based on her daily rates for each type of scene.

For large-sized scenes:
- She can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
- The number of days needed for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

For medium-sized scenes:
- She can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
- The number of days needed for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

For small-sized scenes:
- She can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
- The number of days needed for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we need to find the total number of days it will take her to complete all the scenes. Since she can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to consider the longest period required for any one type of scene, which is 9 days for the large-sized scenes.

So, it will take her 9 days to create all the picture scenes."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12, three dozen eggs equal 3 * 12 = 36 eggs. She has four children, so if she divides the 36 eggs equally among her four children, each child would receive 36 / 4 = 9 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how much Jen spends on food for her fish in the month of May.

1. Jen has 3 fish.
2. Each fish needs $1 worth of food a day.
3. May has 31 days.

First, we calculate the daily cost for all the fish:
\[ 3 \text{ fish} \times \$1 \text{ per fish per day} = \$3 \text{ per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the month of May:
\[ \$3 \text{ per day} \times 31 \text{ days} = \$93 \]

So, Jen spends $93 on food in the month of May.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$93 \]"
"Patricia originally had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so she had:
\[ 30 - 24 = 6 \]
roses left. Then she bought 15 more roses, so she now has:
\[ 6 + 15 = 21 \]
roses. The final numerical answer is 21."
"To find the average speed, we need to use the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, let's calculate the total distance Sid traveled. He traveled 110 miles and then an additional 140 miles. So the total distance is:

\[ 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time Sid spent traveling. He spent 2 hours and then an additional 3 hours. So the total time is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"First, let's understand the probabilities of each ticket winning.

For the first ticket, the probability of winning is 20%, which can be written as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. So, the probability of the second ticket winning is 3 times the probability of the first ticket winning. 

\[ \text{Probability of the second ticket winning} = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning since the events are independent.

\[ \text{Probability of both tickets winning} = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's find out how many seashells each person collected.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells. According to the problem, Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from the number Jim collected:

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number Carlos collected by 2:

\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we add up all the seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 59 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{59}{3} = 19 \frac{2}{3} \]

So, each person got \( 19 \frac{2}{3} \) seashells. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 19 \frac{2}{3} \]"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total for weekdays and the total for weekends separately, and then add them together.

For weekdays (Monday to Friday), he eats 4 carrots each day. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
So, the total for weekdays is \(4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots}\).

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend.
So, the total for the weekend is \(5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots}\).

Now, we add the total for weekdays and the total for the weekend to get the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
So, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is \(20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots}\).

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, we need to find out the length of the second song. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes long.

To find 60% of 5 minutes, we calculate:
\[ 60\% \times 5 = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. Therefore, the length of the second song is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much Linus sold each mobile device for. He sold it for twice the original price, which was $20. So, the selling price is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one mobile device. The profit is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many mobile devices Linus bought in total. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since each device gives a profit of $20, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's find out how tall Ned is. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Ned's height} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 \]
\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Carl's height} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} \]
\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 3 feet."
"To solve this, we need to find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. So, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, we need:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the required production:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 7300 bottles."
"First, let's determine how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

Carla has 8 babies in total. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ babies in purple} \]

The remaining 1/4 are dressed in blue:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ babies in blue} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the babies wear bows. All the babies dressed in blue also wear bows, so that's 2 babies. Additionally, 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple also wear bows:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ babies in purple wearing bows} \]

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue-wearers)} + 2 \text{ (purple-wearers wearing bows)} = 4 \text{ babies wearing bows} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. We know that 2 out of the 4 babies wearing bows are dressed in purple. So, the percentage is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} \times 100 = 50\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's do the calculation:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold in the first two transactions.

He started with 80 square meters of land.

He sold half of the land for $50. So, half of 80 square meters is:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

The price for 40 square meters was $50, so the price per square meter was:
\[ \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. So, 1/4 of 80 square meters is:
\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

The price for 20 square meters was $30, so the price per square meter was:
\[ \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

Now, let's calculate the total money he earned from the first two transactions:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30

Total money from the first two sales:
\[ 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much land he has left to sell. He originally had 80 square meters and sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. So, the remaining land is:
\[ 80 - 60 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold the remaining 20 square meters at $3 per square meter:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling all his land:
\[ 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"First, we need to find half the age of Haley. Since Haley is 26 years old, half of her age is:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Geb is 10 less than this value, so we subtract 10 from 13:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old. The final numerical answer is:

3"
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, then in one day he uses:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ face masks} \]

To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in one day by 2:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ face masks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find out how many apartments that is, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, we know the total number of apartments John collects garbage from each week is:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections he makes in a week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his total weekly earnings are:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1248 \]"
"Let's break down the information given and calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree each year.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 3 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 7 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:

- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = \(50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350\)

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20. So, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope can be expressed as \( Y - 7 \) centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope can be expressed as \( 4 \times (Y - 7) \) centimeters.

The total length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4 \times (Y - 7) = 37 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Next, solve for \( Y \):

\[ 6Y = 37 + 35 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope:

\[ 4 \times (Y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially.

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to his sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's account is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that the mural is made up of four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. The amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal.
3. Half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is made up of red, white, and purple paint.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since the red, white, and purple paint are equal, let's say each of these colors uses \( x \) pints. Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint combined is \( 3x \) pints.

The yellow paint makes up half of the mural, so it uses \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total paint used:
\[ 3x + 6 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3x = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3x = 6 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each of the red, white, and purple paint uses 2 pints. Therefore, the total amount of red paint used is:
\[ 2 \text{ pints} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, we can calculate the area of one bedroom as:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ \text{Area of living room} = 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of bedrooms} + \text{Area of living room} + \text{Area of the rest of the house} \]

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- Monday: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
- Tuesday: She sees double the number of clouds as Monday, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 puffs.
- Wednesday: She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 puffs.
- Thursday: She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 puffs.
- Friday: She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 puffs.

Now, let's add up all the puffs of clouds she counted from Monday to Friday:

3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93 puffs of clouds.

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which has 100 pods.

20% of 100 pods is calculated as:
\[ 100 \times \frac{20}{100} = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs the same as the regular box, which is $12. We need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

The cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{100} = 0.12 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If we use 1 pod per cycle, then with $1, we can run:
\[ \frac{1}{0.12} = \frac{100}{12} = \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33 \text{ cycles} \]

Since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we can run 8 full cycles with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 and each bill is $20, we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 bills, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, Thomas triples his money. Since each bill is $20, tripling the 20 bills means he has:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Thomas then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. Since each 20 dollar bill is equivalent to 4 five-dollar bills (because $20 \div 5 = 4$), 60 twenty-dollar bills are equivalent to:

\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \]

So, Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, so team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals in the first half.
3. In the second half, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
4. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals in the second half.
5. Therefore, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total goals scored by each team:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in the match.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in the match.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. So, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, the chalk remaining after Monday is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Chalk Usage Rate**: The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day after Monday. So, the chalk used each day after Monday is:
   \[
   2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Recycling Condition**: The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it reaches this condition.

5. **Days Calculation**: We need to find the number of days \(d\) such that the chalk length is less than 2 inches. The chalk length after \(d\) days can be calculated as:
   \[
   2.75 - 0.55d < 2
   \]
   Solving for \(d\):
   \[
   2.75 - 2 < 0.55d
   \]
   \[
   0.75 < 0.55d
   \]
   \[
   d > \frac{0.75}{0.55}
   \]
   \[
   d > 1.3636
   \]
   Since \(d\) must be a whole number, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 days before it is recycled.

So, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, let's find out how many girls are not on varsity. Since there are 12 girls in total and 4 are on varsity, the number of girls not on varsity is:
\[ \text{Number of girls not on varsity} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Similarly, let's find out how many boys are not on varsity. Since there are 12 boys in total and 3 are on varsity, the number of boys not on varsity is:
\[ \text{Number of boys not on varsity} = 12 - 3 = 9 \]

Finally, to find the total number of students not on varsity, we add the number of girls not on varsity to the number of boys not on varsity:
\[ \text{Total number of students not on varsity} = 8 + 9 = 17 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's find out how many face masks Mike bought. According to the question, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Now, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The question states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

To find out how many masks Johnny bought, we can use the following calculation:
- Thrice the number of masks Mike bought is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
- Adding 2 more to that gives us \(15 + 2 = 17\).

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is 17."
"First, let's find out how many teeth the dentist caps. The problem states that the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth he caps is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Now, we know the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 11 teeth. So, the total number of teeth the dentist fixes is:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially bought. He bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk.

\[ \text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} \]

\[ \text{Milk returned} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the refund amount. The refund is based on the cost of the milk returned.

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]

\[ \text{Refund amount} = \$5600 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$5600 \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by finding Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5(20 + 7) \]
\[ W = 5 \times 27 \]
\[ W = 135 \]

Now, let's check the second condition with these ages:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old.
Wendy's current age is 135, so in 25 years, Wendy will be \( 135 + 25 = 160 \) years old.
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. So, we can calculate the number of books he can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by $500 and then multiplying by 100.

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Number of books} = 54 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Number of books} = 5400 \]

Now, Bob wants to distribute these 5400 books equally among 3 schools.

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} \]

\[ \text{Books per school} = 1800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1800 books per school."
"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of those apples landed on Newton's head, so he now has 1 apple.
3. Newton picked up the two apples that fell, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
4. Now, Newton has 1 (from his head) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples.
5. He picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused 6 more apples to fall out of the tree.
6. Now, Newton has 1 (from his pocket) + 6 (newly fallen) = 7 apples.

So, Newton brought home 7 apples."
"First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali ordered. Since each bag weighs 50 kg and he ordered 850 kg, we divide the total weight by the weight of one bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each bag costs $18, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 306 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many cheese pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total. Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices of cheese pizza} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to find out how many whole cheese pizzas are required to get 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pepperoni pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total. Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices of pepperoni pizza} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required to get 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Now, we need to find out the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy. She needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

From the information given:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles.
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. That's 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days together:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

So, the final numerical answer is 19 miles."
"First, let's figure out how many snowballs Jay can make in an hour before any melt. He can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. This means that in 15 minutes, he actually makes 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs.

Now, let's find out how many 15-minute intervals are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 / 15 = 4 intervals in an hour.

In one hour, he makes 18 snowballs. To find out how many snowballs he makes in 4 intervals, we multiply 18 by 4:
18 * 4 = 72 snowballs in an hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to make 60 snowballs. Since he makes 72 snowballs in an hour, we can divide the number of snowballs he needs by the number of snowballs he makes in an hour:
60 / 72 = 0.8333 hours.

To convert this into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
0.8333 * 60 = 50 minutes.

So, it will take Jay 50 minutes to have 60 snowballs. The final numerical answer is 50."
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon came out, we can find Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2.

So, Jim's age at that time was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since the question asks for Jim's current age and no information is given about how old Jim has become since then, we can only conclude that Jim was 14 years old when Digimon came out."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find out how many slices they all ate together, we add the slices each person ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They had \(50\) bandages at the start of the second day.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(25\) bandages.
   - They had \(22\) bandages at the start of the third day.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\) bandages.

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, we calculated they had 97 bandages left. This discrepancy suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or our interpretation. Given the problem constraints and our calculations, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so she had 2 inches cut off. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40. So, the total cost is:

\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

"First, let's calculate how many hours Jen works in a week:
Jen works 7.5 hours a day and she works 6 days a week.
So, the total hours she works in a week is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, let's calculate how many hours she works in a month:
Since there are 4 weeks in April, the total hours she works in April is:
\[ 45 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 180 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate her earnings from her hourly rate:
Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her earnings from working 180 hours is:
\[ 180 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences for April, she also receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. So, her total earnings for April are:
\[ 270 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 280 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Jason earned for each task:

- For doing laundry: $3.00
- For cleaning his room: $1.50
- For taking the trash out: $0.75 per trip, and he did this twice, so 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
- For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did this 6 times, so 6 * $0.50 = $3.00

Now, let's add up all the earnings:

- Laundry: $3.00
- Cleaning room: $1.50
- Taking trash out: $1.50
- Emptying dishwasher: $3.00

Total earnings = $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in a two week period."
"First, let's find out how much blood one shark has. Since a whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we can calculate the blood volume of one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume of one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, to find out the total blood volume for ten sharks, we multiply the blood volume of one shark by ten:

\[ \text{Total blood volume for ten sharks} = 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Morning People**: 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. **People at 10:00**: 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00. This means the total number of people at 10:00 is:
   \[
   50 + 40 = 90
   \]
3. **People by Evening**: Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later. So, the number of people who came in later is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80
   \]
4. **Additional People by Evening**: An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number of people that came in first is 50, so:

5. **Total People**: Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:
   \[
   50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (later)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
   \]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens.
She bought twice the amount of black pens, so she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens.
Each pack has 5 pens, so she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens.
In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.
The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\$600}{10 \text{ bottles}} = \$60 \text{ per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \$60 \times 1.5 = \$90 \text{ per bottle} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \text{ bottles} \times \$90 \text{ per bottle} = \$1800 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$600 + \$1800 = \$2400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2400 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. So, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than he did on the first day. So, he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. So, he planted \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees planted: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees planted: \(40 + 50 = 90\)
   - Total trees planted: \(50 + 90 = 140\)

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140."
"First, let's calculate how much root beer Fred had left after each event.

1. Fred started with 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons, so:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, so:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party and shared the remaining root beer equally. So, we need to divide the 8 gallons by 3.

\[
\frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
2.67
\]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

We are given the equation: 
\[ 4 \times \text{number of coffee mugs} + 8 = 40 \]

First, we need to isolate the term with the number of coffee mugs. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{number of coffee mugs} = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4 \times \text{number of coffee mugs} = 32 \]

Next, we need to find the number of coffee mugs. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{number of coffee mugs} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ \text{number of coffee mugs} = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

To find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
42
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so now Amy has only one palette with four colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 \div 2 = 3\]

So, after using up half of the colors from one makeup set, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's find out how tall Mattison's house is. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and he is 60 inches tall, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is. Since this floor is thrice as high as Mattison himself, we can calculate it as:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor floor to ceiling} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor floor to ceiling from the total height of the house:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor floor to ceiling} \]
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total to find out how many shells are left.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total.

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles the other dogs need to walk and then subtract that from the total average miles per day.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since the average they need to walk per day is 3 miles, and there are 4 dogs, the total miles all dogs need to walk per day is:
3 miles/dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles all dogs need to walk:
12 miles (total) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"First, let's find out how much loan John gets. His house is worth $250,000 and he gets a loan worth 40% of that.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Now, to find out how much money he has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"First, we need to find the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught. We do this by adding the weights of the three tunas:

56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, we know that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. To find out how much Deandre will earn, we multiply the total weight of the tunas by the price per kilogram:

128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

So, the final numerical answer is $64."
"First, let's find out how much Trinity sold each magazine for. She sold them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, we need to calculate 11/8 of $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99 \]

So, she sold each magazine for $99.

Now, to find her profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, her profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting:

- On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes \(1 \times 2 = 2\) liters of water per day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water removed during each period:

- For the low setting, Brian ran it for 3 days. So, the total water removed is \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).
- For the medium setting, Brian ran it for 3 days. So, the total water removed is \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).
- For the high setting, Brian ran it for 5 days. So, the total water removed is \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, let's add up all the water removed:

\[3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."
"First, we need to find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends initially had. They filled 10 packs with 30 balloons each. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons/pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 288 \]"
"First, let's find out how much medicine is in one dose. Saanvi combined 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the amount of the second medicine is:

\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, the total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicines:

\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

To find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, let's find out the capacity of Ali's class. We know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Now, let's find out the capacity of John's class. Since John's class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of John's class as follows:
\[ \text{Capacity of John's class} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

John has two classes, so the total capacity of John's school is:
\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's school and John's school:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen promised to return. He borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. So, the interest is:

\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

Adding the interest to the borrowed amount gives:

\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 each month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount paid over 11 months from the total amount Stephen promised to return to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month:

\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:

\[ 31 \]"
"Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for 2 children, it would be 5 * 2 = 10 diaper changes per day. Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base that is 6 inches by 6 inches, and it is 15 inches tall. So the volume of the jar is:

\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans fit into the jar based on the given efficiency. Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume of the jar by the volume of one jelly bean to find the theoretical number of jelly beans that could fit, and then multiply by the efficiency.

The volume of one jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, the theoretical number of jelly beans that could fit is:

\[ \text{Theoretical number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Volume of the jar}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{540}{0.15} = 3600 \]

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual number of jelly beans that fit is:

\[ \text{Actual number of jelly beans} = 3600 \times 0.80 = 2880 \]

Now, we know that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, the number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. So, the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was 36 jelly beans off in his guess."
"First, let's calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

On the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \]
So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people can fit on the bus, we subtract the number of people currently on the bus from the bus's capacity:
\[ 200 - 180 = 20 \]

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate the initial cost of one visit to the museum. The initial cost is $2.

Next, we need to find out the new cost after a 150% increase. A 150% increase means the cost is multiplied by 1.5 (100% + 150% = 250% = 2.5, but since we're increasing, we use 1.5).

So, the new cost per visit is:
\[ 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]

Pauline visited the museum three times a year for 5 years, which means she visited the museum:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ times} \]

After 5 years, she continued to visit the museum for 3 more years, which means she visited the museum:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ times} \]

So, the total number of visits over the 8 years is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \text{ visits} \]

Since each visit costs $3, the total amount spent is:
\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many groups of students can try the escape room and then calculate the total time required.

1. First, we need to find out how many students are eligible to try the escape room. Since there are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), the total number of students is:
   \[
   10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Each group can have 8 students, and they use 45 minutes to try the escape room. We need to find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the 30 students:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 3.75 \text{ groups}
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can only form 3 full groups of 8 students each.

3. Each of these 3 groups will use 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
   \[
   3 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 135 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables. John made 4 wooden tables and each table costs $20. So, the total cost for the tables is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames and each frame costs $10. So, the total cost for the frames is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the frames to find out the total amount Ali has to pay:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

So, the final amount Ali has to pay John is:
\[ 100 \]"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many pounds of meat Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:
   \[
   \text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much of the secret seasoning he needs. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound:
   \[
   \text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning}
   \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning."
"First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we can calculate the total width as follows:

\[ \text{Total width} = 5 \times 35 \text{ inches} \]

\[ \text{Total width} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ \text{Fabric needed} = 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Fabric needed} = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after that.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

For the remaining minutes (36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.2 per minute. So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost of the 36-minute call:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$8.00 \]"
"To find out how much rain will fall on Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much it rained on Monday.
2. Calculate twice the amount of rain that fell on Monday.
3. Add 1 inch to the result from step 2 to find out the expected rain for Tuesday.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Rain on Monday = 2 inches.
2. Twice the amount of rain on Monday = 2 * 2 = 4 inches.
3. Expected rain on Tuesday = 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches.

So, the expected amount of rain on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"First, let's figure out the total number of treats needed. Since there are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Let's say Carly made \( c \) cupcakes. According to the problem, she made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she made is:
\[ 3c - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a pedicure without any discounts:
- Basic manicure: $35
- Pedicure: $40

Now, let's add these two costs together:
- Total cost without discount: $35 + $40 = $75

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount for getting both services:
- Discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
- Total cost after discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 fingers per hand and 5 hands), and each nail art costs $3:
- Cost of nail art: 10 fingers * $3 per finger = $30

Finally, add the cost of the nail art to the total cost after the discount:
- Total cost including nail art: $60 + $30 = $90

So, Karen would pay $90 in all."
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan gets from the magazines that send 12 issues a year. She orders 3 of these magazines, so:

\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues per magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of issues she gets from the magazine that sends 6 issues a year:

\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues per magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's find out how many issues she gets from the last magazine. The last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:

\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, we add up all the issues from all the magazines:

\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:

\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"If Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, then Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Since Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

So, the final answer is 31."
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.

An 80% increase means the price becomes 180% of the original price. So, we calculate 180% of $40.

\[ 180\% \text{ of } \$40 = \frac{180}{100} \times 40 = 1.8 \times 40 = \$72 \]

So, the price of the toy in December is $72.

Next, we calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

A 50% decrease means the price becomes 50% of the December price. So, we calculate 50% of $72.

\[ 50\% \text{ of } \$72 = \frac{50}{100} \times 72 = 0.5 \times 72 = \$36 \]

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a lesson:
- The standard fee is $80 per hour.

Next, let's calculate the reduced fee for a lesson to a veteran:
- The reduced fee is 25% less than the standard fee.
- 25% of $80 is calculated as \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
- So, the reduced fee is \( 80 - 20 = 60 \) dollars per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Charlie makes from the standard lessons:
- He has 4 lessons at the standard rate of $80 each.
- Total for standard lessons: \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Charlie makes from the veteran lessons:
- He has 2 lessons at the reduced rate of $60 each.
- Total for veteran lessons: \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars.

Finally, let's add the totals from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie makes for the day:
- Total amount: \( 320 + 120 = 440 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is 440 dollars."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

First, let's add up all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 650

Now, we count the number of quizzes, which is 9.

To find the mean, we divide the total sum of the scores by the number of quizzes:
Mean = Total Sum of Scores / Number of Quizzes
Mean = 650 / 9

Now, let's do the division:
650 / 9 = 72.2222...

Rounded to two decimal places, the mean score is 72.22.

So, the final numerical answer is:
72.22"
"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she was left with 1/4 of the original amount. So, she has 20 / 4 = 5 pomelos left. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number she has left from the original number:

20 - 5 = 15

Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them.

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after eating is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. So, we need to calculate 25% of 36.

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

The number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, the total money he received is:

\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 81 \]"
"If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, then one quarter of the number of novels she has written this year is 9 novels divided by 3, which is 3 novels.

To find the total number of novels she has written this year, we multiply the number of novels that represent one quarter by 4 (since 4 quarters make a whole year). So, 3 novels * 4 = 12 novels.

The final answer is 12 novels."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days and then find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this represents.

First, let's find out how many hours Michael travels in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels for:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he covers in 72 hours at an average speed of 50 km/hr:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Now, to find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance that Michael has covered is 60%."
"First, let's find out how many grapes Madeline's brother used. Since he used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can calculate the number of grapes her brother used as follows:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used in total by Madeline and her brother. We add the grapes Madeline ate to the grapes her brother used:

\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, we can calculate the total number of grapes used for the pies:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grapes were there at the beginning. We add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother to the grapes used for the pies:

\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:

\[ 84 \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's do the calculation:

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 69 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 78

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cheese per week:
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs twice as much as cheddar cheese, so it costs $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and Gruyere cheese to find the total cost per week:
- Pasta costs $1.00.
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs $6.00.

So, the total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply the weekly cost by 52:
- $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's calculate the total time needed to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, we multiply 15 minutes by 80 classrooms:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} \times 80 \text{ classrooms} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms. However, this percentage seems unrealistic because it exceeds 100%. Let's recheck the calculations:

- Total time needed: 1200 minutes
- Convert to hours: 1200 minutes ÷ 60 = 20 hours
- Workday: 8 hours
- Percentage: (20 hours ÷ 8 hours) × 100 = 2.5 × 100 = 250%

The calculation is correct, but the interpretation of the result is not practical. The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning, which means they are working more than one full day in the 5 days available."
"First, let's determine how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books that can be held by all the shelves:

- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total books the shelves can hold: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the total number of books the shelves can hold:

\[
\frac{110}{55} = 2
\]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. The final numerical answer is:

2"
"First, let's find out how many eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens would be:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the eggs. Since each dozen costs $2.40, five dozens would cost:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much Rose will sell the eggs for. She sells them at $1 for 3 eggs. So, for 60 eggs, she would sell them in groups of 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group is sold for $1, the total selling price would be:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ 8 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find out how many hats are left:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining hats are blue. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find out how many are white:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's find out the regular price of the beef jerky bag. The regular price is $18.00.

Since there's a $3.00 discount, the price Archie will pay is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Archie is buying 1 bag, which contains 30 sticks of beef jerky. To find out the cost per stick, we divide the total cost by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50. Since the question asks for the final numerical answer in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer in cents is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct.

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.6 = 42 \]

Now, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to pass. The total number of questions she needs to answer correctly is:

\[ \text{Total questions to pass} = \frac{70\%}{100\%} \times (70 + 40) = 0.7 \times 110 = 77 \]

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, she needs to get:

\[ \text{Questions correct on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So we can write this as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So we can write this as:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes."
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Multiply the total number of games by her average score per game.

First, let's calculate the total number of games:
- Ara plays 40 games every year.
- She has been playing for 4 years.

So, the total number of games is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we calculate the total points scored:
- Her score per game is 21 points.
- She has played 160 games.

So, the total points scored is:
\[ 21 \text{ points/game} \times 160 \text{ games} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ 3360 \]"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he added 3 - 1 = 2 marbles to his collection. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 5 + 2 = 7 marbles. 

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To solve this, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given averages.

1. **Determine how many customers Jason needs to see to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, Jason needs to see 2 * 2 = 4 customers.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs to see 15 * 2 = 30 customers.

2. **Determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to see 30 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
   - To see 30 customers, Jason needs to make 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"First, let's determine the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms. So, the total number of flashlights is:

\[ 4 \text{ (for people)} + 2 \times 8 \text{ (for rooms)} = 4 + 16 = 20 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and the candles are divided into two groups: 4 small candles for half the rooms and 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms. Half of the rooms is:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ rooms} \]

So, the number of small candles is:

\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ small candles/room} = 16 \text{ small candles} \]

And the number of medium candles is:

\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles/room} = 20 \text{ medium candles} \]

Adding the small and medium candles together gives the total number of candles:

\[ 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles} \]

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to find the final answer:

\[ 20 \text{ flashlights} + 36 \text{ candles} = 56 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 56 \]"
"First, we need to find out the total number of chips Mitchell bought. He bought two bags of chips, and each bag contains 55 chips. So, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag:

\[ 2 \times 55 = 110 \]

Now, Mitchell has 110 chips in total. His family consists of 5 members, and he wants to distribute the chips equally among them. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

\[ 110 \div 5 = 22 \]

So, each person gets 22 chips. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 22 \]"
"First, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, the Rubik's cube takes 30 minutes to solve."
"If there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, then there were 20 / 2 = 10 robots.

Also, Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs, so there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the helmets, robots, and footballs together: 20 helmets + 10 robots + 40 footballs = 70 items.

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Tim works in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the number of hours he works by 60:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calls he can handle in a day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ 360 \text{ minutes/day} \div 15 \text{ minutes/call} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during a 5 day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 120."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total drying time for both the old and new varnishes and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \(72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for each group of plants:

- For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups of water.
- For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups of water.
- The rest of the plants are \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\) plants. These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups of water.

Now, let's add up all the water needed:

- Water for the first group: 2 cups
- Water for the second group: 8 cups
- Water for the third group: 2 cups

Total water needed: \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of the journey.

Phineas needs to travel a total of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. His speed on land is 20 yards per minute. So, the time taken to hop 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. His speed in water is 10 yards per minute. So, the time taken to swim 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time taken for both parts of the journey to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on land} + \text{Time in water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."
"First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks and he needs 56, we divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Each box costs $2.00, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The main phone costs $20.
2. Each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone. So, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.
3. There are five phones in total, and one of them is the main phone. So, there are 5 - 1 = 4 additional phones.
4. The cost of the 4 additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.
5. The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

So, the final numerical answer is 60."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day and one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we calculate:
   \[
   10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much money he makes in a day. Since he sells each doughnut for $2, we calculate:
   \[
   120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times \$2/\text{doughnut} = \$240/\text{day}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

4. Finally, to find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in June:
   \[
   \$240/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$7200
   \]

So, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"First, let's find out how many photos Jade can upload in one day. She uploads 6 batches each day, and each batch contains 7 photos. So, the number of photos she uploads in one day is:

\[ 6 \text{ batches/day} \times 7 \text{ photos/batch} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take her to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in one day:

\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one week:

- Cost for 5 blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
- Cost for 1 skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00
- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00/pair = $16.00

Now, let's add these up to find the total cost for one week:

Total cost for one week = $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

Since Alicia needs to do this every week for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:

Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's find out John's new speaking speed after training. If his normal speed is 150 WPM (words per minute) and his new speed is 2.5 times faster, we calculate his new speed as follows:

\[ \text{New Speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, 10 pages will have:

\[ \text{Total Words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, to find out how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} \]

Let's calculate the time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, so he saw \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day, so he saw \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, we need to find out how many people Conor saw on the rest of the week (fourth and fifth days). We know the average number of people Conor saw each day for the week was 60. Since there are 5 days in the week, the total number of people Conor saw over the week is \(60 \times 5 = 300\).

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the fourth and fifth days as \(x\). The total number of people seen over the week can be expressed as:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + x + x = 300\]
\[260 + 2x = 300\]
\[2x = 40\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Conor saw 20 people on the fourth day and 20 people on the fifth day. The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 20 + 20 = 300\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop. So, \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop. So, \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds. So, \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. Since 40 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that amount is:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

So, the total number of kernels that pop is:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[210\]"
"First, let's determine how many cups of lemon juice Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 cups, 4 gallons would be:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ cups/gallon} = 16 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice for every gallon of lemonade. So, for 16 cups of lemon juice, he needs:

\[ 16 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many lemons are needed to get 16 cups of lemon juice. We know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Therefore, to get 16 cups of juice, Tim needs:

\[ 16 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 96 \text{ lemons} \]

Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. This means Tim needs to make an additional gallon of lemonade, which requires 1 cup of lemon juice. So, Tim needs:

\[ 1 \text{ cup} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 6 \text{ lemons} \]

Adding the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon, the total number of lemons Tim needs is:

\[ 96 \text{ lemons} + 6 \text{ lemons} = 102 \text{ lemons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 102 \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily dog food consumption for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

- Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food per day. With 3 German Shepherds, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
  \[
  3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/German Shepherd} = 15 \text{ kg}
  \]

- Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food per day. With 2 Bulldogs, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
  \[
  2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/Bulldog} = 6 \text{ kg}
  \]

- The total daily consumption for all the dogs is:
  \[
  15 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} = 21 \text{ kg}
  \]

Now, to find out how much dog food they will need in a week, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[
21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals.

For the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

For the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the legs together to get the total number of legs:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"First, let's figure out how many yellow blocks there are. We know there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks. So, the number of yellow blocks is:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, we know the total number of blocks is 32. We have 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks. Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \). The total number of blocks can be expressed as:

\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} + R \text{ (red)} = 32 \]

So,

\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ R = 32 - 12 \]

\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20."
"First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west.

He was driving at an average speed of 18 mph for 5 hours. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance he traveled west is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{west}} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east.

He was driving at the same average speed of 18 mph for 8 hours. So, the distance he traveled east is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{east}} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to consider the directions he traveled. He traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east. The net distance from his starting point can be calculated by subtracting the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:

\[ \text{Net Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{east}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{west}} \]

\[ \text{Net Distance} = 144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat originally costs $9000.
   - It depreciates 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = Original value - Depreciation = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year = $6300.
   - It depreciates 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = Value at start of second year - Depreciation = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year = $4410.
   - It depreciates 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = Value at start of third year - Depreciation = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- There are 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies in total.
- There are 54 red candies.
- There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are \(54 \times 2 = 108\) orange candies.
- There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are \(54 \div 2 = 27\) yellow candies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: 108
- Yellow candies: 27

Adding these together gives us the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

\[ 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \]

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

\[ 232 - 189 = 43 \]

So, the number of pink candies is 43."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It's given as $80.

Next, we need to find out the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that one bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, we calculate 10% of $80:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$80 = \frac{10}{100} \times 80 = \$8 \]

Now, we know that Helen rode the bus 7 times. So, the total cost for the bus trips is:

\[ 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

Helen stayed in the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

To find the total cost for both the hotel and the bus trips, we add the two amounts together:

\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$296 \]"
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them. Dallas originally had 21 marbles and dropped 4, so:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \]

This means Dallas has 17 marbles left after the drop. Since Dallas and Darla together have all 52 marbles that Mazie gave them, we can find out how many marbles Darla has by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

So, Darla has 35 marbles. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Therefore, Mazie gave 35 marbles to Darla. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 35 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for the adult tickets is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- The cost of a child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child, so the total cost for the child ticket is \(1 \times 8 = 8\) dollars.
- Adding the cost of the adult and child tickets together, we get \(24 + 8 = 32\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns:
- Each popcorn costs $3, and they buy 2 popcorns, so the total cost for the popcorns is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns to find the total amount paid:
- The total cost is \(32 + 6 = 38\) dollars.

So, the family pays a total of 38 dollars."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car and the luggage and the children together.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so the total weight of the children is \(75 \times 2 = 150\) pounds.

Adding these together gives the total weight:
\[ 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
\[ 1600 \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know Emma is 56 years old, we can find the average of their ages. The formula for the average of two numbers is:

Average = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Substituting the ages we have:

Average = (40 + 56) / 2
Average = 96 / 2
Average = 48

So, the average of their ages is 48."
"First, we need to find the total number of seashells they found together. Tom found 214, Nancy found 432, and Benny found 86. So, we add these numbers together:

\[ 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 \]

Next, we know that 67 of these seashells were cracked. To find the number of good seashells, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells:

\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Avery needs 3 pieces per place setting.
2. She's having 12 people over, so she needs 12 place settings.
3. Each place setting includes:
   - 1 dinner plate
   - 1 salad plate
   - 1 bowl

Now, let's calculate the cost for one place setting:
- Dinner plate costs $6.00
- Salad plate costs $4.00
- Bowl costs $5.00

So, the total cost for one place setting is:
$6.00 (dinner plate) + $4.00 (salad plate) + $5.00 (bowl) = $15.00

Since she needs 12 place settings, the total cost will be:
$15.00 (cost of one place setting) × 12 (number of place settings) = $180.00

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate how much feed one pig eats in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- So, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, calculate how much feed all five pigs eat in a day:
- Since there are five pigs, they eat \(8 \times 5 = 40\) pounds of feed per day.

Now, calculate how much feed all five pigs eat in a week:
- There are 7 days in a week, so in a week, they eat \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left after a week, subtract the amount of feed the pigs ate in a week from the total amount of feed Dexter ordered:
- \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds of feed is left.

So, the final numerical answer is 20 pounds."
"First, we need to find out how many hot dogs John needs in total. Since he invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the total number of hot dogs needed as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party, so we subtract these from the total number of hot dogs needed:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"First, let's calculate how much money Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

Now, let's add the money she makes from cupcakes and cookies:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Frances spends on the trays of cookies.

She buys five trays at $4 each, so:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Now, let's subtract the money she spends on the trays from the money she made:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

So, the final amount of money Frances has left is:

Meals given out:
- Friday: 64 meals
- Saturday: 30 meals
- Sunday: 48 meals

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Total meals to distribute = 1,360 meals

Meals left to distribute = Total meals to distribute - Total meals given out
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

So, the final numerical answer is 1,218 meals."
"To solve this, we need to know the value of each type of coin in cents:
- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents.

Now, let's calculate the total value:
- The value of the quarters is 25 cents each, so for 1 quarter, it's 25 cents.
- The value of the nickels is 5 cents each, so for 2 nickels, it's 5 * 2 = 10 cents.
- The value of the dimes is 10 cents each, so for 7 dimes, it's 10 * 7 = 70 cents.

Adding these values together:
25 cents (from the quarter) + 10 cents (from the nickels) + 70 cents (from the dimes) = 105 cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to add up the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

We know the ages of the sisters:
- The first sister is 16 years old.
- The second sister is also 16 years old.

So, the total age of the sisters is:
\[ 16 + 16 = 32 \]

We know the age of one of the brothers is 12 years old. The problem states that this age is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, the age of the older brother is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

So, the total age of the brothers is:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends meditating each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, so that's 30 minutes per day.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends meditating in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, in 4 weeks there are 4 * 7 = 28 days. So, the total time spent meditating in 4 weeks is 28 days * 30 minutes/day = 840 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga. She practices yoga 5 days a week, and each session is 1 hour long. So, in one week, she spends 5 days * 1 hour/day = 5 hours on yoga. Over 4 weeks, she spends 4 weeks * 5 hours/week = 20 hours on yoga.

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we add the time spent on meditation and the time spent on yoga:
840 minutes (meditation) + 20 hours (yoga) = 840 minutes + 20 * 60 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes) = 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

So, the total time spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 2040 minutes."
"To find out the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the square feet from each type of t-shirt and then add them all together.

So, the total square feet of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find out how many more seeds that is, we calculate 50% of 36:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, a large sunflower has:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second one at 50% off. So, the price of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

The total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. With a 40% discount, the shoes cost $40 * 0.4 = $16 less.

So, the discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

Total amount spent = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the final numerical answer is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after doing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he gets $6 for each week he completes his chores, we can calculate his total allowance as follows:

\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream cones is:

\[ 4 \, \text{ice cream cones} \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars/ice cream cone} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Ryan wants to go to the movies and the tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \, \text{dollars} \div 6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket} = 2 \, \text{tickets} \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent. She bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, the total amount Lani spent is:
\[ 30 + 100 + 100 = 230 \]

Now, to find out how much they spent in all, we add the amounts spent by Ellen and Lani:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, the total amount they spent is:
\[ 335 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * 6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * 8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * 10 = $20

Now, let's add up the cost of ingredients for one jar:
Cost of one jar = Cost of passion fruit + Cost of jackfruit + Cost of honey
Cost of one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the profit from one jar is:
Profit from one jar = Selling price - Cost of ingredients
Profit from one jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find out the profit from selling 10 jars:
Profit from 10 jars = Profit from one jar * 10
Profit from 10 jars = $6 * 10 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then add them together.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Justin has 120 nickels.
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Justin has 750 pennies.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add the values of all the coins together to get the total dollar amount in the jar.
\[
8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is **31 dollars**."
"First, let's add up all the expenses Janet has:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets it's $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40.00. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenses from the amount her parents gave her:

$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"First, let's figure out how many days Josh works in a week. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. So, he works 7 days - 2 days = 5 days a week.

Next, we need to find out how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day and works 5 days a week, he services 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week.

Now, we need to calculate how much he makes in a week. He gets paid $4 per car, so in a week, he makes 15 cars/week * $4/car = $60/week.

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2. So, $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

The final numerical answer is $120."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy had initially:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies

Next, Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal cookies left: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies left: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies left: 5 - 1 = 4

After eating 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies left: 8 - 2 = 6

After giving 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar cookies left: 4 - 2 = 2

Now, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Finally, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
Total cookies now = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies

So, the final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's break down Matthew's collection into two equal parts since the buyer is willing to pay half the collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy.

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers in total. Half of 12 is 6, so he has 6 toy soldiers at $5 each and 6 toy soldiers at $7 each.

Now, let's calculate the total money he would earn from each part of his collection:

For the 6 toy soldiers at $5 each:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

For the 6 toy soldiers at $7 each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total money Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 72."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"First, we need to find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average each year. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of students at Norman High School by \( \frac{3}{4} \).

The number of students at Norman High School is 4000. So, the number of students at Butler High School is:
\[ 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School:
\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1000 \]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's do the calculation:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered 2 more than the number asked for, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, and Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor should have placed on the lab bench:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these up: 8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Igor actually placed 29 items on the lab bench. To find out how many beakers he lost, we need to see the difference between the total number of items he should have placed and the total number he actually placed:

31 (should have placed) - 29 (actually placed) = 2

So, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, then the second basket has twice as many, which is 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's find out how much money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money they all raised:
Total = Alexandra's amount + Kim's amount + Sarah's amount + Maryam's amount
Total = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700
Total = $2180

So, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine how fast Aaron ran each mile. If Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can calculate the time it took for Aaron to run his part of the race.

Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since he ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can find out how long it would take Vanessa to run the same distance by considering the speed ratio.

If Aaron's speed is \( S \) miles per minute, then Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{S}{2} \) miles per minute. Since Aaron ran 4 miles in 16 minutes, we can calculate his speed as follows:
\[ S = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, using this speed, we can find out how long it would take Vanessa to run 4 miles:
\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race. Let's confirm this with the final numerical answer.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"First, let's calculate how much line is needed for the dock. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3 to find out how much line is needed:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Now, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line needed} - 6 \text{ feet of line he already has} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"First, let's calculate how much money Tom's restaurant makes in one night.

They get 6 reservations a night.
For each reservation, they order 2 meals and a bottle of wine.
Each meal costs $5, so 2 meals cost $5 * 2 = $10.
The bottle of wine costs $5.

So, the total cost for one reservation is $10 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total cost for one night is $15 * 6 = $90.

Now, they are open 2 days a week, so the total cost for one week is $90 * 2 = $180.

The final numerical answer is $180."
"First, let's find out the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the $80 he spent.

To calculate the profit, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} \]

Given:
- Cost Price = $80
- Profit Percentage = 25% = 0.25 (as a decimal)

So, the profit is:
\[ \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

Now, the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

To find out the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old.
3. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old.
4. James is 18 years old, and he is 3 years older than Dora, so James is 3 years older than his sister Dora.

Now, let's find out how old John is:
- John had James when he was 19.
- James is 18 years old now, so John is 19 + 18 = 27 years old now.

Next, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is:
- John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
- Since John is now 27 years old, the youngest son is 32 - 27 = 5 years old now.

Finally, we need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years:
- In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how many oranges each person can peel in one minute. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she can peel 1/3 of an orange. Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she can peel 1/4 of an orange.

Now, let's calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes).

For Ana:
\[ \text{Oranges peeled by Ana in 60 minutes} = 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \text{ oranges} \]

For Jane:
\[ \text{Oranges peeled by Jane in 60 minutes} = 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled:
\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400 and he gets it at 80% off.

80% off means he pays 20% of the original price. So, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs him $80.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

So, the mechanic charges $150 for the installation.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is $230."
"To solve this, let's use a system of equations. Let's say \( C \) is the number of chickens and \( W \) is the number of cows. We know two things:

1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + W = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4W = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2W = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + W = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2W = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2W - C - W = 15 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, there are 15 cows. Now we can substitute \( W = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to find out the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
