"Let's try to figure this out.

We know the flutist lives in the second house. 

There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. This means the pianist lives in either house 1 or house 4 (since the flutist is in house 2). But house 1 can't be the pianist because then there wouldn't be a house between the flutist and the pianist if the pianist was in house 1. So the pianist lives in house 4.

The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. The guitarist can't be in house 4 because the pianist is in house 4. The guitarist can't be in house 2 because the flutist is in house 2. The guitarist can't be in house 1 because then the person with the tulips would have to be in a house that doesn't exist (to the left of house 1). So the guitarist must be in house 3.

"From clue 5, the person who likes green lives in the first house. 
From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover. 
From clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.

So, the person in the third house must eat grapes. 
Then, the root beer lover must live in the second house.

From clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house. 
Since the person in the first house has a television, the person in the second house likes blue, and the person in the third house has a gameboy, the person in the first house must be the percussionist, the person in the second house must be the guitarist, and the person in the third house must be the cellist is not possible (since the person in the third house has a gameboy and the cellist lives one house away from the person who has a gameboy). 
So, the person in the first house must be the percussionist, the person in the second house must be the guitarist, and the person in the third house must be the cellist is not possible. 
Then, the person in the first house must be the percussionist, the person in the second house must be the cellist, and the person in the third house must be the guitarist.

"That's an easy one.  The answer is (A) 5. It says so right in the clues, number 1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 1, the soccer player lives to the left of the person eating oranges. This means the person eating oranges can't live in house 1, 'cause there's no one to the left of them. So, the person eating oranges lives in either house 2 or 3.

From clue 4, the person with daffodils lives to the right of the person eating oranges. If the person eating oranges lives in house 2, then the person with daffodils lives in house 3. If the person eating oranges lives in house 3, then there's no one to the right of them, so that can't be.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given in the clues.

From clue 8, the person who owns horses lives in the third house.

Now, let's try to piece together the information.

Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, and the person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating grapes must be in the fourth or fifth house.

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the right of the fish enthusiast, and the person who has a radio lives directly next to the person who has a carnations arrangement. The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house, so the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a radio must live in the fifth house and the fourth house, in some order.

Since there is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives, the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or third house. However, the person who owns horses lives in the third house, so the person who is eating a banana must live in the second house.

Since there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives, the cat lover must live in the fifth house.

"Let's think this through. 

From clue 1, we know the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff can't live in house 1, 'cause there's no house to the left of house 1. So the history book buff lives in house 2.

Now, from clue 1 again, the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff. So the person who drives a convertible lives in house 1.

From clue 2, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing boots lives in house 2.

Now we know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 1, and the person who is wearing boots lives in house 2. Since the people in these houses have different characteristics, the person who is wearing sandals must live in house 1.

So the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 5, the golfer lives in the first house.

From clue 3, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the golfer is in the first house, the mystery book reader and the history book buff can't be in the first and second houses. They can be in the second and third, or the third and fourth.

From clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the swimmer can't be in the third house (clue 4), the swimmer and the romance book lover can be in the second and third, or the first and second. But the golfer is in the first house, so the swimmer and the romance book lover must be in the second and third.

Now we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 4: ?

From clue 2, the basketball player does not live in the fourth house. So the basketball player must live in the remaining spot, which is not possible since the second house is taken by the swimmer.

That's an easy one. The mystery book reader lives in house number 3. It says so right in clue 3.
"Let's try to figger this out. 

From clue 2, we know the person with the gameboy lives left of the person with the computer. 

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives left of the person with the gameboy. 

So, we got: green, gameboy, computer. 

Now, from clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow don't live in the second house. 

If the person who likes green lives in the first house, then the person with the gameboy lives in the second house, and the person with the computer lives in the third house. 

But if the person who likes green lives in the second house, then the person with the gameboy lives in the third house, and the person with the computer lives in the second house, but that can't be 'cause the person who likes yellow don't live in the second house, and the person who likes green can't live in the third house 'cause the person with the gameboy lives left of the person with the computer.

So, the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person with the gameboy lives in the second house, and the person with the computer lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

From clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. But clue 5 says the root beer lover lives in the third house too. So, the person who likes red and the root beer lover are the same person.

From clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. Clue 4 says the romance book lover doesn't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house. That means the history book buff lives in the third house, but we already know someone lives there, so that can't be right. Wait, clue 3 says the history book buff doesn't live in the fourth house, but it don't say they can't live in the first house. So, the history book buff lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

Now, from clue 1, there are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives. If the coffee drinker lives in the first house, then the person who likes white would have to live in the fourth house, but that would mean there's only one house between them, not two. If the coffee drinker lives in the second house, then the person who likes white would have to live in the fourth house again, and that still don't work. If the coffee drinker lives in the third house, then the person who likes white would have to live in the first house, but we already know the history book buff lives there. So, the coffee drinker must live in the fourth house.

That's my answer: (B) 4."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house. 

From clue 3, we know the fish enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fish enthusiast must live in the second house.

Since the fish enthusiast lives in the second house, the cat lover must live in the first house.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this, we'll go through the clues step by step.

From clue 4, the dog owner lives in the second house.

From clue 14, the dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the dog owner lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first or third house. But from clue 5, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. This means the person who likes red cannot live in the first house, so the person who likes red lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or second house. But the dog owner lives in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.

From clue 8, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the person who likes milk must live in the first house as well, but this is not possible. So, the person who likes milk must live in a house that is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, but since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, this is not possible. However, we can conclude that the person who likes milk lives in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house as well. But this is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the information.

From clue 2, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue. From clue 8, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the person who likes milk must live in the first house as well, but this is not possible. However, we can conclude that the person who likes milk lives in the first house, and the person who likes blue lives in the second house, but the dog owner lives in the second house, so this is not possible. So, the person who likes milk lives in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, and the person who likes blue lives in the second house is not possible. However, we can conclude that the person who likes milk lives in the first house, the person who likes blue lives in the second house is not possible, so the person who likes milk lives in the first

The answer is (A) 1.
"From clue 6, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. 
From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other. 
From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. 
From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.

Combining these clues, we can deduce that the person who had pizza, the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, the order must be: spaghetti, pizza, grilled cheese, and stew. 

From clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the same house as the person who had pizza.

From clue 9, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis cannot live in the first and second houses, or the fourth and fifth houses. 

From clue 10, the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. This means the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the first house.

From clue 11, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos. From clue 2, the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples. This means the order must be: oranges, apples, mangos.

Considering all the information, the order of the houses is: 
1. Carnations arrangement, spaghetti, oranges
2. Rose bouquet, pizza, kiwis
3. Tulips, grilled cheese, apples
4. Lilies, stew, mangos
5. Daffodils, fried rice, grapes

The person who had stew lives in house 4."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the person with tulips must be in the first house, and the dog owner must be in the second house. But wait, the cat lover is in the first house, so the person with tulips can't be in the first house. This means the cat lover must have tulips.

From clue 3, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives. 

From clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.

So far, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover with tulips
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: ? 
- House 4: ?

Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house (clue 2), and the cat lover is in the first house, the person with daffodils must be in either the third or fourth house.

Now, let's think about the horses and carnations. There is one house between them. If the person who owns horses lives in the third house, then the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the first or fifth house. But there is no fifth house, so the person who owns horses can't live in the third house. 

If the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house, then the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second or sixth house. But there is no sixth house, so the person who owns horses can't live in the fourth house either.

This means the person who owns horses must live in the second house, but the dog owner is already in the second house. Wait, this can't be right. I made a mistake. Let me rethink this.

If the person who owns horses lives in the third house, then the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the first or fifth house. But there is no fifth house, so the person who owns horses can't live in the third house.

This means the person who owns horses must live in the first or second house, but the cat lover is in the first house, and the dog owner is in the second house. Wait, I did it again. I made another mistake.

Let me rethink this again. If the person who owns horses lives in the first house, but the cat lover is already in the first house. If the person who owns horses lives in the second house, but the dog owner is already in the second house.

No, wait, the person who has a carnations arrangement can live in the second house if the dog owner has carnations.

So far, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover with tulips
- House 2: Dog owner with carnations
- House 3: ? 
- House 4: Person who owns horses

From clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.

This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third house.

From clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils can live in the first, third, or fourth house. But the cat lover is in the first house, and the person who owns horses is in the fourth house, so the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the third house. But the person who has a bouquet of lilies is already in the third house.

"Let's think this through. 

From clue 1, we know the person with a phone lives in house 1.

From clue 2, we know the person with boots doesn't live in house 2. So, the person with boots must live in house 1.

From clue 3, we know the person with horses and the person with a radio live next to each other. Since the person with a phone lives in house 1, the person with a radio must live in house 2. 

Now, we know the person with boots lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2. Since the person with boots lives in house 1, the person with high heels must live in house 2.

So, the answer is (A) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 1, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other.

From clue 10, the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house, so the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house. 
From clue 9, the person who has a computer lives next to the person who is wearing loafers, so the person who has a computer must live in the second house. 
From clue 1, the person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person who has a computer, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house. 

From clue 10, the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone, so the person who has a phone must live in the third house.

The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house, so the person who is wearing loafers likes blue.

The person who likes yellow must live in the second or third house. 
From clue 8, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. 
The person who is eating mangos cannot live in the third house, so the person who is eating mangos must live in the first or second house. 
The person who is eating mangos cannot live in the first house, because the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

That's an easy one.  The answer is (E) 1. It says so right in clue 11.
"I'll try my best to figure this out.

From clue 7, the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television. 

From clue 2, the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. This means the person who is eating kiwis can't be in house 3, 'cause then the person who is eating oranges would have to be to the right of them, but there ain't no house to the right of house 3. 

From clue 5, the person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is eating kiwis can't be in house 3, 'cause then the person who is wearing boots would have to be to the right of them, but there ain't no house to the right of house 3. 

So, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1. 

From clue 2, the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. So, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 2. 

From clue 7, the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television. So, the person who has a television must be in house 3.

So, the answer is (A) 3."
"From clue 7, the person who likes milk lives in the third house. From clue 4, the person who is eating a banana lives directly next to the person who likes milk. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the third house (clue 2), the person who is eating a banana lives in either the second or the fourth house.

From clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. From clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. From clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. 

Since the person who likes milk lives in the third house, the person who only drinks water cannot live in the third house. The person who only drinks water cannot live in the fourth house either, because then the person who likes yellow would have to live in the fifth house, and the person who owns an SUV would have to live to the right of the person who likes milk (clue 8), but there is no house to the right of the fifth house.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. The person who owns a sedan lives directly next to the person who likes yellow (clue 13), so the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house is not possible, and the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house is also not possible because the person who only drinks water lives in the second house.

"From clue 5, we know the person eating kiwis lives in house 1. 

From clue 3, we know the person driving a truck does not live in house 1. 
From clue 1, we know the person driving a truck does not live in house 3. 
So the person driving a truck must live in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the person owning an SUV does not live in house 3. 
From clue 5, we know house 1 is taken by the person eating kiwis. 
We also know the person driving a truck lives in house 2. 
So the person owning an SUV must live in house 1 or 2, but since house 1 is taken by the person eating kiwis, the person owning an SUV must live in house 2, but we know the person driving a truck lives in house 2. 
So the person owning an SUV must live in house 1, but we know the person eating kiwis lives in house 1. 
So the person eating kiwis must own an SUV.

"From clue 6, the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 4, the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house, the person who likes red cannot live in the fifth house. The person who likes red also cannot live in the fourth house, as the person who likes white lives there. The person who likes red must live in the third house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the first or second house.

From clue 3, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. From clue 5, the person who is wearing loafers lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. From clue 1, there is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives. 

From clue 8, the person who is wearing boots lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who is wearing loafers lives to the left of the person who drives a truck, the person who is wearing boots must live to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.

So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house, and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the fourth house, but the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fifth house, but the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.

"That's an easy one. The answer is (B) 1. It says so right in clue 2: ""The history book buff lives in the first house."""
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct information step by step.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player lives in the first house.

From clue 15, the soccer player and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the soccer player lives in the first house, the baseball player must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the person who is eating apples does not live in the second house.

From clue 14, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.

From clue 20, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.

From clue 9, the cricketer does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the saxophonist lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

From clue 21, there is one house between where the pianist lives and where the person who had stew lives.

From clue 2, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

From clue 6, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

From clue 19, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

From clue 13, the cellist and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.

From clue 7, there is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the violinist lives.

From clue 12, the person who ate fried rice and the swimmer live directly next to each other.

From clue 18, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 17, the science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.

From clue 16, the flutist does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 11, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.

Considering all the given information, we can deduce that the person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

Alright, so we know the history book buff lives in the second house (clue 3), and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (clue 7). That means the history book buff has a bouquet of daffodils.

We also know the person who likes yellow doesn't live in the first or third house (clues 2 and 4), so they must live in the second house. But wait, the history book buff lives in the second house, so the person who likes yellow must be the history book buff.

Now, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live next to each other (clue 8). Since the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, the person who is wearing boots must live in either the first or third house. But the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house (clue 6), so the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels (clue 1). Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house too, or the person who likes blue would have to live in a non-existent house to the right of the first house. But the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, so the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second or third house. But the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, so the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second house. But the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, and they can't be wearing high heels and boots at the same time, so this is a problem.

Wait, I made a mistake. The person who is wearing high heels can't live in the second house, 'cause the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, and they can't be wearing high heels and boots at the same time. So the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house, and the person who likes blue lives to the right of them, so the person who likes blue lives in the second or third house. But the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, so the person who likes blue must live in the third house.

Now, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (clue 5). The person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third house too, or there wouldn't be anyone to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. But the person who likes blue lives in the third house, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies can't live in the third house. This is another problem.

Wait, I made another mistake. The person who has a bouquet of lilies can't live in the third house, 'cause the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and they can't have a bouquet of lilies and daffodils at the same time. So the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first or second house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of them. But the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second or third house. But the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third house, but that's not possible.

That's an easy one. The answer is (B) 1. It says so right in the first clue.
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the cricketer lives in the first house. 

From clue 4, the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the cricketer lives in the first house, the person who owns horses must live in the first house, and the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house.

Now, from clue 3, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. So, the cat lover must live in the third house.

From clue 1, the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the cat lover lives in the third house, the person who drives a truck must also live in the third house. But we already know the cat lover lives in the third house, so the cat lover must drive a truck.

Now we have:
- House 1: cricketer, horses
- House 2: sedan
- House 3: cat lover, truck

The only sport left is soccer and basketball. The cricketer is already in house 1, so the basketball player must be in house 2, because if the basketball player was in house 3, the person who drives a truck would not be to the right of the basketball player.

So, the basketball player lives in house 2.

Answer: (B) 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the correct order of the houses.

From clue 4, we know the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.

From clue 8, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 16, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 3, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.

Considering the above clues, the person who has a vase of tulips cannot live in the first, second, or third house.

The answer is (A) 3.
"To solve this, let's break down the information we have:

- The person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker (Clue 1) and the guitarist (Clue 4). This means the person with the television cannot live in house 3, as there is no one to the right of them. 
- The tea drinker does not live in the second house (Clue 3), so the tea drinker must live in house 3. 
- The person with the television lives directly left of the tea drinker, so the person with the television must live in house 2.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker (Clue 2). Since the tea drinker lives in house 3, the person eating kiwis must also live in house 3, and the coffee drinker must live in either house 1 or 2.
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house (Clue 7), which is the person with the television.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio (Clue 6). Since the person with the television lives in house 2, the person with the radio must live in house 1.
- There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives (Clue 5). This means the flutist and the banana eater cannot live in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3. They must live in houses 1 and 3. Since the person with the radio lives in house 1, the person eating a banana must live in house 3, and the flutist must live in house 1.
- The person eating kiwis lives in house 3, but the person eating a banana also lives in house 3. This is a contradiction, so the person eating a banana must live in house 1, and the flutist must live in house 3.
- The person eating kiwis lives in house 3, and the person eating a banana lives in house 1. The person eating apples must live in house 2.
- The person with the television lives in house 2, and the person with the television lives directly left of the guitarist (Clue 4). The guitarist must live in house 3, but the flutist lives in house 3. This is a contradiction, so the guitarist must live in house 3 is incorrect. The guitarist must live in house 2 is also incorrect, as the person with the television lives in house 2. The guitarist must live in house 1, but the person eating a banana lives in house 1, and the person with the radio lives in house 1. This is a contradiction, so the person with the radio must live in house 2, and the guitarist must live in house 1.
- The person with the television lives in house 2, and the person with the television lives directly left of the tea drinker (Clue 1). The tea drinker must live in house 3.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio (Clue 6). The person with the radio lives in house 2, so the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 3.
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house (Clue 7), which is the person with the radio.
- The person eating kiwis lives in house 3, the person eating a banana lives in house 1, and the person eating apples lives in house 2.
- The person with the television lives in house 2, the person with the radio lives in house 2 is incorrect, and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2 is also incorrect.

"From clue 7, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the history book buff lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house.

So, the answer is (B) 4."
"From clue 3, the flutist lives left of the person who likes white. 
From clue 4, the person wearing loafers lives left of the person who likes white. 
Since both the flutist and the person wearing loafers live left of the person who likes white, they must be the same person. 

From clue 1, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house. 
So the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. 
Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house. 
So the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house. 
Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: spaghetti, SUV, flutist, loafers
- House 2: fried rice, sedan, ?, ?

Since the flutist lives in the first house, the cellist lives in the second house. 
Since the person wearing loafers lives in the first house, the person wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out. 

From clue 4, the root beer lover lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house (clue 3), they must live in the second house. The person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who owns a sedan cannot live in the third house (because the root beer lover lives there), and the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house. But we already know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. So, the person who only drinks water owns a sedan.

From clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house, the person who is eating apples lives in the third house. But we already know the root beer lover lives in the third house. So, the root beer lover is eating apples.

From clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the third house, the violinist cannot live in the third house. The violinist must live in the second house, but we already know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. Wait, that's not possible. The violinist must live in the first house, but we already know the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house. That's not possible either. 

Let's re-examine the clues. From clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. From clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the third house, the violinist cannot live in the third house. The violinist must live in the second house, but we already know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. The violinist must live in the first house, but we already know the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house. 

From clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given in the clues.

From clue 12, the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who likes white does not live in the second house. Since the second house is taken by the person wearing high heels, the person who likes white can be in the first house.

From clue 16, the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television. Since the person who likes white is in the first house, the person who owns horses can be in the first house, and the person who has a television can be in the second house.

"I think I can figger this out. 

So, the person with the TV lives in house 1. That's clue 2. Now, the person with the lilies don't live in house 1, that's clue 1. 

So, if the person with the lilies don't live in house 1, they must live in house 2. And if the person with the TV lives in house 1, that means the person with the computer must live in house 2, 'cause they can't both have the same thing.

So, the answer is (A) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. 

From clue 1, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer. This means the science fiction book fanatic can't live in house 2, so they must live in house 1. 

Now, since the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1, the history book buff must live in house 2 (because they live next to each other).

From clue 3, we know the guitarist lives to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. If the guitarist lives in house 2 (to the right), then the person with daffodils must live in house 1. 

Now we have:
- House 1: science fiction book fanatic, daffodils
- House 2: history book buff, guitarist

The person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other, so the person who had pizza must live in house 1. This means the person who had spaghetti lives in house 2.

We also know the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1 and the golfer lives to the right of them, so the golfer must live in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: science fiction book fanatic, daffodils, pizza, baseball player (because the golfer lives in house 2)
- House 2: history book buff, guitarist, spaghetti, golfer

The only thing left is the percussionist. Since the guitarist lives in house 2, the percussionist must live in house 1.

So, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given in the clues.

From clue 8, the violinist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

From clue 3, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since there are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives (clue 9), and the bird keeper lives in the fifth house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must live in the first and second houses (or the second and third houses, but we'll come back to that).

From clue 2, the dog owner does not live in the second house. 

From clue 4, the flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television. From clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. 

From clue 6, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. From clue 1, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist. 

From clue 5, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. 

Since the violinist lives in the fourth house, and the bird keeper lives in the fifth house, the person who has a television must live in the third house (because the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy, and the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist).

The flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television, so the flutist must live in the second house.

The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other, and since the dog owner does not live in the second house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must live in the first and second houses, but the flutist lives in the second house, so the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses cannot live in the first and second houses. They must live in the second and third houses, but the person who has a television lives in the third house, so the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses cannot live in the second and third houses. They must live in the first and second houses is not possible, so they must live in the second and third houses is not possible, so they must live in the first house and the third house is not possible, so they must live in the first house and the second house is not possible, so they must live in the second and third house is not possible, so they must live in the first and third house is not possible, so they must live in the first house and the second house is not possible, so they must live in the second and third house is not possible, so they must live in the first and third house is not possible, so they must live in the first house and the second house is not possible, so they must live in the second and third house is not possible, so they must live in the first and third

"From clue 3, we know the root beer lover does not live in the second house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. If the root beer lover lived in the third house, there would be no one to the right of them. So the root beer lover must live in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. So, the person in the first house is wearing either boots or running shoes.

From clue 2, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person in the first house is wearing either boots or running shoes, and the person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house (clue 1), the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house. 

Now, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, because they live directly left of the person who ate fried rice.

So, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the remaining house, which is not the first house (clue 4) and not the second house (because the person in the second house is wearing boots). But wait, we already know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

"To solve this, let's break down the information given in the clues.

From clue 11, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

From clue 16, the romance book lover and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, the romance book lover does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 4, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.

From clue 13, the person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.

From clue 15, the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.

From clue 17, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

From clue 6, the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 19, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.

From clue 10, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.

From clue 14, there are two houses between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who is eating grapes lives.

From clue 9, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the person who had stew lives and where the person who had pizza lives.

From clue 12, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 18, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.

From clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 2, the history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.

Considering all the information, we can deduce the following:

- The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house (clue 15).
- The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan (clue 6).
- The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan (clue 19).
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy (clue 10).
- The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges (clue 17).

Considering the above information, the possible arrangement for houses 3-5 is:
- House 3: science fiction book fanatic (clue 11)
- House 4: person eating a banana
- House 5: person eating oranges, person owning a sedan, person driving a minivan

However, the person eating oranges cannot live in house 5 (clue 6), so the person eating oranges must live in house 4, and the person owning a sedan must live in house 3. The person driving a minivan must live in house 5.

- House 3: science fiction book fanatic, person owning a sedan
- House 4: person eating a banana, person eating oranges
- House 5: person driving a minivan

Now, let's consider the remaining houses.

- The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who has a radio (clue 12).
- There is one house between where the person who had stew lives and where the person who had pizza lives (clue 8).
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes (clue 9).
- There are two houses between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who is eating grapes lives (clue 14).

Considering the above information, the possible arrangement for houses 1-3 is:
- House 1: person who had stew, person who has a radio
- House 2: person who had pizza, person who is eating grapes
- House 3: (already determined)

However, the person who had pizza cannot live in house 2 (clue 8), so the person who had pizza must live in house 1, and the person who had stew must live in house 2 is not possible (clue 8), so the

However, the cat lover is in the second house, the person wearing boots (the dog owner) is in the third house, the person wearing loafers (the swimmer) is in the fourth house, and the person who owns horses and has a carnations arrangement is in the fifth house, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in the third house. However, the person wearing boots (the dog owner) is in the third house, so this is not possible.

"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 1, we know the person eating kiwis lives in house 1.

From clue 4, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

From clue 5, we know the dog owner doesn't live in house 1, so the dog owner must live in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other. Since the dog owner lives in house 2, the bird keeper must live in house 1, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2.

From clue 3, we know the tennis player and the person eating apples live next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis lives in house 1, the person eating apples must live in house 2. And since the person eating apples lives in house 2, the tennis player must live in house 1.

Now, we know the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, has a bird, and plays tennis. We also know the person in house 2 is eating apples, has a dog, and reads science fiction books.

The only thing left is the cricketer and the mystery book reader. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2, the mystery book reader must live in house 1. And since the tennis player lives in house 1, the cricketer must live in house 2.

So, the cricketer lives in house 2.

Answer: (A) 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the information step by step.

From clue 9, the person who is eating oranges lives in the second house. 
From clue 12, the swimmer lives in the second house. 
So, the person who is eating oranges is the swimmer.

From clue 10, the fish enthusiast lives in the third house.

From clue 2, the cat lover lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. 
So, the cat lover lives in the second house, but we already know the swimmer lives in the second house. 
However, clue 2 also says the cat lover lives directly left of the fish enthusiast, and the second house is directly left of the third house. 
So, the cat lover cannot live in the second house. 
This is a contradiction, but we can resolve this by re-examining the clues. 
From clue 8, the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. 
From clue 9, the person who is eating oranges lives in the second house. 
So, the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. 
From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives in the fifth house. 
So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.

From clue 3, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house. 
From clue 6, there are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives. 
From clue 11, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples. 
From clue 14, there is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

Now, let's try to find the person who is eating grapes. 
We already know the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, and the person who is eating oranges lives in the second house. 
The person who is eating kiwis and the dog owner have one house between them, and the person who is eating apples and the bird keeper have the person who is eating kiwis between them. 
The person who ate spaghetti and the bird keeper have two houses between them. 
The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, and the person who had pizza lives in the fifth house. 
The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.

Considering all the information, the only possible arrangement is:
- First house: mangos, fried rice, cricketer, cat lover
- Second house: oranges, swimmer
- Third house: fish enthusiast
- Fourth house: grapes, grilled cheese, golfer, dog owner
- Fifth house: pizza

So, the person who is eating grapes lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue. From clue 12, the person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other. 

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives in the first house. From clue 3, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red. From clue 9, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza. 

Considering the information, the person who likes green lives in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza. The person who is eating mangos also lives directly left of the person who likes red. So, the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (B) or the fourth house (A). 

From clue 5, the person who drives a truck does not live in the third house. From clue 7, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. 

Considering the information, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue, and the person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other (clue 13). The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other (clue 11). 

Considering the information, the person who had pizza cannot live in the third house (C) because the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, and the person who drives a truck does not live in the third house. 

So, the person who had pizza lives in the second house (D)."
"Let's think this through. 

We know the baseball player lives in the second house (clue 2) and the person who drives a convertible also lives in the second house (clue 3). 

We also know the person eating grapes doesn't live in the first house (clue 1). 

So, if the person eating grapes doesn't live in the first house, they must live in the second house. But we already know the second house has the baseball player and the convertible driver. 

That means the person eating mangos must live in the first house. 

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. So, the person eating kiwis must live in house 3.

From clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives to the left of the person eating oranges. Since the person eating kiwis lives in house 3, the person eating apples must live in house 1, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2. But wait, the person who likes blue lives in house 2. So, the person eating oranges must live in house 2 and like blue.

Now, from clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. The person who likes blue lives in house 2, and the person eating kiwis lives in house 3. So, the person who likes green must live in house 1, and the person who likes white must live in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader can't live in house 1, because there's no one to the left of house 1. So, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Now, from clue 3, the person with a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader lives in house 2, the person with a gameboy must live in house 1.

From clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. If the person with a rose bouquet lived in house 2, then the root beer lover would have to live to the right of house 2, but there's no house to the right of house 2. So, the person with a rose bouquet must live in house 1.

From clue 4, we know the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner. 

From clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner and the dog owner. This means the truck owner can't be in house 1 or 4, because there wouldn't be two houses between them and the dog owner. 

From clue 3, we know the truck owner lives directly left of the sedan owner. 

Now, let's try to put the truck owner in house 2. If the truck owner is in house 2, the sedan owner would be in house 3. But then, there wouldn't be two houses between the truck owner and the dog owner. So, the truck owner can't be in house 2.

This means the truck owner must be in house 3. The sedan owner would be in house 4. 

Now, from clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (house 3) and the dog owner. This means the dog owner must be in house 1.

But wait, from clue 4, we know the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner. If the dog owner is in house 1, there's no house to the left of the dog owner. So, this can't be right.

Let's try again. If the truck owner is in house 3, the sedan owner is in house 4. From clue 2, there are two houses between the truck owner (house 3) and the dog owner. This means the dog owner must be in house 1, but that can't be right. So, the dog owner must be in house 2, but that can't be right either (because of clue 5, the cat lover does not live in the second house, but we don't know who lives in the second house yet). 

So, the dog owner must be in house 1 or house 2, but we already know that can't be right. Let's try to put the dog owner in house 3. But then, there wouldn't be two houses between the truck owner and the dog owner.

So, the dog owner must be in house 4, but then the fish enthusiast would have to be in house 3, and the minivan owner would have to be in house 2 (from clue 1), and the truck owner would have to be in house 1 (from clue 3), but then there wouldn't be two houses between the truck owner and the dog owner.

"From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. 

From clue 2, the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house. However, we already know that the person who likes milk is in the fourth house. 

But from clue 3, the root beer lover lives in the second house. And from clue 4, the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. 

So, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house is incorrect.

"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 6, the person who likes blue lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the baseball player lives to the left of the cat lover. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the baseball player must live in the first house, and the cat lover must live in the third house.

From clue 4, the dog owner lives to the left of the person who likes green. Since the cat lover lives in the third house, the person who likes green must also live in the third house. The dog owner must live in the first or second house. But the baseball player lives in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house. However, the person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the dog owner cannot live in the second house. This means the person who likes green cannot live in the third house. The only other option is that the person who likes green lives in the second house, but that's not possible since the person who likes blue lives in the second house. So, the person who likes green must live in the first house, and the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing sandals lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner lives in the second house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers lives to the right of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house, but that's not possible. So, the person who is eating grapes must live in the first or second house. But the baseball player lives in the first house, so the person who is eating grapes must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house, the basketball player must live in the first house. But the baseball player lives in the first house, so the basketball player cannot live in the first house. This means the person who is eating grapes must live in the first house, and the basketball player must live in the second house.

From clue 1, the cricketer lives to the right of the person who is eating oranges. Since the basketball player lives in the second house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, but that's not possible since the person who is eating grapes lives in the first house. So, the person who is eating oranges must live in the second house, but that's not possible since the basketball player lives in the second house. This means the person who is eating oranges must live in the third house, and the cricketer must live in the third house, but that's not possible since the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house. So, the person who is eating oranges must live in the second house, and the cricketer must live in the third house.

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:

- House 1: baseball player, person who is eating grapes, person who likes green, dog owner (but the dog owner lives in the second house, so the person who likes green must live in the first house)
- House 2: person who likes blue, dog owner, basketball player, person who is eating oranges (but the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house, so the person who is eating grapes must live in the second house)
- House 3: cat lover, person who is wearing sandals, cricketer, person who is eating oranges

Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, and the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who likes white must live in the third house. But the cat lover lives in the third house, so the person who likes white must be the cat lover.

Since the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house.

Since the dog owner lives in the second house, and the cat lover lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the first house.

So, the bird keeper lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

From clue 2, the person who owns horses lives in the first house. 
From clue 13, the cricketer lives in the fourth house. 
From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.

From clue 12, the coffee drinker lives in the fifth house. 
From clue 17, the cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the cellist lives in the fourth house, but since the cricketer lives in the fourth house, the cellist must be the cricketer. 

From clue 14, the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper. 
From clue 1, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. 
From clue 5, there is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives. 

Considering the given information, the only possible arrangement is: 
- House 1: Horse owner (golfer, pianist, or percussionist)
- House 2: 
- House 3: Person who ate grilled cheese (flutist or guitarist)
- House 4: Cricketer (cellist, dog owner)

From clue 14, the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper. 
From clue 1, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.

- House 2: 
- House 3: Person who ate grilled cheese (flutist or guitarist)
- House 4: Cricketer (cellist, dog owner)
- House 5: Coffee drinker

Since the bird keeper lives to the right of the golfer, and there is one house between the pianist and the bird keeper, the bird keeper must live in house 5, and the pianist must live in house 3. But the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 3, so the pianist must be the person who ate grilled cheese. 

Now, the bird keeper lives in house 5, and the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper, so the tennis player must live in house 4, but the cricketer lives in house 4. However, this is not possible. 

Re-examining the information, we can conclude that the bird keeper does not live in house 5. The only possible arrangement is: 
- House 1: Horse owner (golfer, pianist, or percussionist)
- House 2: 
- House 3: Person who ate grilled cheese (flutist or guitarist, pianist)

- House 5: Coffee drinker

Since the bird keeper lives to the right of the golfer, and there is one house between the pianist and the bird keeper, the bird keeper must live in house 4, and the pianist must live in house 2. But the cricketer lives in house 4, so the bird keeper cannot live in house 4. 

The only possible arrangement is: 
- House 1: Horse owner (golfer, pianist, or percussionist)
- House 2: Pianist
- House 3: Person who ate grilled cheese (flutist or guitarist)
- House 4: Cricketer (cellist, dog owner)

- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Cricketer (cellist, dog owner)
- House 5: Coffee drinker

From clue 14, the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper, so the tennis player must live in house 2. But the pianist lives in house 2, so the pianist must be the tennis player.

"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 1, the cellist lives to the left of the person with a gameboy. That means the cellist can't have the gameboy, 'cause they live next to 'em. 

Now, from clue 2, the dog owner don't live in the first house. That means the dog owner must live in the second house.

So, I think the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy. So the person who has a radio lives in the 4th house.

From clue 3, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house, the person who has a phone must live in the second house, and the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house, but we already know the person who has a radio lives in the 4th house. So the person who owns an SUV must live in the 4th house is not possible.

Let's try again. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house. So the person who has a phone must live in the second house, and the person who owns an SUV must live in the third house, but we already know the person who has a gameboy lives in the 3rd house.

"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

From clue 3, the person with tulips lives in house 3. 

From clue 6, the person with a computer lives in house 2.

From clue 2, the person with a phone lives to the left of the person with a television. Since the person with a computer is in house 2, the person with a phone must be in house 1, and the person with a television must be in house 4 or 5.

From clue 1, the person with lilies lives to the right of the person with a phone. So the person with lilies can't be in house 1 or 2. 

From clue 7, the person with a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with a carnations arrangement. 

Now, let's try to put it all together. We know the person with tulips is in house 3, and the person with a computer is in house 2. The person with a phone is in house 1, and the person with a television is in house 4 or 5. 

If the person with a television is in house 4, then the person with a phone is in house 1, the person with a computer is in house 2, the person with tulips is in house 3, the person with a television is in house 4, and the person with lilies can't be in house 1, 2, or 3, so the person with lilies must be in house 5. But then where's the person with a carnations arrangement? 

So the person with a television must be in house 5. Now we have: the person with a phone is in house 1, the person with a computer is in house 2, the person with tulips is in house 3, and the person with a television is in house 5. 

From clue 4, the person with daffodils lives to the right of the person with a radio. The person with daffodils can't be in house 4 (clue 5), so the person with a radio must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But the person with a phone is in house 1, and the person with a computer is in house 2, so the person with a radio must be in house 3, but that's where the person with tulips lives. So the person with a radio must be in house 2, but that's where the person with a computer lives. So the person with a radio must be in house 1, but that's where the person with a phone lives. Wait, I made a mistake. The person with a radio can be in house 2 or 3, but not house 1. The person with a computer is in house 2, so the person with a radio must be in house 3, but that's where the person with tulips lives. So the person with a radio must be in house 2, but that's where the person with a computer lives. I did it again. 

Let me start again. The person with a phone is in house 1, the person with a computer is in house 2, the person with tulips is in house 3, and the person with a television is in house 5. The person with a radio can't be in house 1 (phone), house 2 (computer), house 3 (tulips), or house 5 (television). So the person with a radio must be in house 4. 

Now we have: the person with a phone is in house 1, the person with a computer is in house 2, the person with tulips is in house 3, the person with a radio is in house 4, and the person with a television is in house 5. 

From clue 4, the person with daffodils lives to the right of the person with a radio. So the person with daffodils must be in house 5, but that's where the person with a television lives.

"From clue 6, the bird keeper lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the cricketer lives in the second house. 

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. Since the cricketer lives in the second house, the cricketer is the fish enthusiast.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first or third house. But the bird keeper lives in the first house, so the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives. Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house. But the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, so this is a contradiction.

"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 4, we know the person eating grapes lives to the left of the person with a computer. Since there are only two houses, the person eating grapes must live in house 1, and the person with a computer lives in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with a computer lives in house 2, the person with a radio must live in house 1.

From clue 1, we know the person with a radio and the person who drives a truck live next to each other. Since the person with a radio lives in house 1, the person who drives a truck must live in house 2.

Now, we know the person who had pizza can't live in house 1 (because the person with a radio lives in house 1 and to the left of the person who had pizza). So, the person who had pizza must live in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"From clue 1, the tea drinker lives in the first house. 
From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives in the second house. 
From clue 2, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. 
Since the first house is taken by the tea drinker, the person who likes milk must live in the first house, and the tea drinker also likes milk.

From clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. 
From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. 
From clue 3, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. 
From clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house. 
From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Considering all the clues, the order is:
- House 1: tea drinker, likes milk, ate pizza (can't be green)
- House 2: coffee drinker, likes green, ate grilled cheese (can't be yellow, and can't be water)
- House 3: likes white, only drinks water, ate spaghetti (can't be yellow)
- House 4: likes yellow, likes red, ate fried rice (can't be green)

So, the person who likes green lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"From clue 4, the dog owner lives in the third house. 
From clue 12, the person who likes white lives in the third house. 
From clue 2, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. 
So, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. 
From clue 8, the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house. 
From clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. 
From clue 11, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

The person who is wearing sandals lives in the first house"
"That's an easy one.  The answer is (A) 1. It says so right in clue 4: ""The person who likes yellow lives in the first house."""
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 1, the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television. 

From clue 2, the golfer does not live in the second house. 

From clue 3, the person with a computer and the person with a vase of tulips live next to each other.

From clue 4, the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet.

From clue 5, the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. 

Since the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television (clue 5), and the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television (clue 1), the order so far is: tennis player, television, radio.

But the person with a radio also lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet (clue 4). This means the person with a rose bouquet must be to the left of the television, and the person with a television must be in the second house (because the tennis player is to the left of the television, and the person with a rose bouquet is to the left of the television). 

So, the order so far is: tennis player, rose bouquet, television, radio.

Now, the golfer does not live in the second house (clue 2), so the golfer must live in either the first or the third house. But the tennis player is already in the first house, so the golfer must live in the third house.

The person with a computer and the person with a vase of tulips live next to each other (clue 3). Since the golfer lives in the third house, and the person with a radio lives in the third house (from the order we figured out earlier), the person with a computer and the person with a vase of tulips must live in the first and second houses.

But the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house, so the person with a computer must live in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To find the house number of the person wearing sandals, let's analyze the given clues.

From clue 3, the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.

From clue 5, the violinist lives in the second house.

From clue 8, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.

From clue 6, the basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.

From clue 10, the baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.

From clue 9, the cricketer lives in the fourth house.

From clue 11, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

Considering the clues, the order of the houses can be determined as follows:

Now, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover, and there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the percussionist lives in the second house, and the romance book lover lives in the third house.

Since the romance book lover lives in the third house, and the romance book lover lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the fourth or the fifth house. However, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the fifth house.

Now, the violinist lives directly next to the saxophonist, and the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. Since the romance book lover lives in the third house, the violinist must live in the fifth house, but the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fifth house. This is a contradiction.

However, we can conclude that the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing loafers, so the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person with a television lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's look at clue 5. It says there are two houses between the person with a radio and the person wearing sandals. This means the person with a radio and the person wearing sandals can't be in the first and second houses (because there's only one house between them), and they can't be in the third and fourth houses (because there's only one house between them). So, the person with a radio must be in the first house, and the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, or the person with a radio must be in the second house, and the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, but we already know the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, so the person with a radio must be in the first house, and the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, but we already know the person with a television lives in the fourth house, so the person wearing sandals must live in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: person with a radio, wearing boots
- House 2: person wearing loafers
- House 3: person wearing sandals
- House 4: person with a television

From clue 3, we know the person with a phone doesn't live in the second house. The only house left for the person with a phone is house 3, but we already know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, so the person with a phone must live in the third house, and the person wearing sandals must be the same person.

Now we have:
- House 1: person with a radio, wearing boots
- House 2: person wearing loafers
- House 3: person with a phone, wearing sandals
- House 4: person with a television

The only device left is the gameboy, and the only house left is house 2, but we already know the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, so the person with a gameboy must be the same person.

The answer is (A) 2."
"That's an easy one.  The answer is (B) 2. It says so right in the clues, ""The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house."""
"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 1, the person wearin' loafers don't live in the first house. That means they gotta live in the second house. 

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who had pizza is wearin' sandals. 

From clue 4, the person who has tulips lives to the left of the person who had pizza. 

From clue 9, the person who is wearin' boots lives to the left of the person who had pizza. 

Now, from clue 1, the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. And from clue 6, the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew. 

From clue 8, the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live next to each other. 

Now, let's try to put it all together. 

If the person who had pizza lives in house 1, then the person who is wearin' sandals would have to live in house 2, but then the person who has tulips would have to live in house 0, which don't exist. 

If the person who had pizza lives in house 4, then the person who is wearin' sandals would have to live in house 5, which don't exist neither. 

If the person who had pizza lives in house 3, then the person who is wearin' sandals would have to live in house 4. The person who has tulips would have to live in house 2, and the person who is wearin' boots would have to live in house 1. 

Now, the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes lives next to the person who has a gameboy. The person who had stew can't live in house 1, 'cause the person who is wearin' boots lives in house 1. The person who had stew can't live in house 4, 'cause the person who is wearin' sandals lives in house 4. The person who had stew can't live in house 3, 'cause the person who had pizza lives in house 3. So the person who had stew must live in house 2. 

But then the person who is wearin' runnin' shoes would have to live in house 1, but the person who is wearin' boots lives in house 1. 

So the person who had pizza must live in house 2."
"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 3, we know the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house. So, the person who is eating apples lives in the second house.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
The answer is (E) 4.
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 4, the person with a rose bouquet doesn't live in the second house. So, they must live in either the first or third house.

From clue 3, the person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other. If the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house, then the person with a sedan must live in the second house. But if the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house, then the person with a sedan must live in the second house as well.

Now, from clue 2, the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. If the person with a sedan lives in the second house, then the person with an SUV must live in the first house, and the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the third house.

But from clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. So, the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house, and the person with a vase of tulips must live in the first house.

Now we have:
- First house: tulips, SUV
- Second house: lilies, sedan
- Third house: rose bouquet, ?

The only car left is the truck, so it must be in the third house.

So, the person who drives a truck lives in house (C) 3."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given in the clues.

From clue 2, the person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

From clue 10, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

From clue 8, the violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the violinist cannot live in the fourth house (clue 3) and the fifth house is taken by the person with a vase of tulips, the violinist must live in the third house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other. Since the violinist lives in the third house, the person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk must live in either the first and second houses or the second and third houses. However, the violinist cannot live next to the person who likes milk, so the person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk must live in the first and second houses.

From clue 12, the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other. 

From clue 15, the pianist and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.

From clue 6, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

From clue 5, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 7, the percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 13, the history book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.

From clue 14, the cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 11, the science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, the violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 9, the romance book lover does not live in the third house.

Considering all the information, the only possible arrangement is:

House 1: History book buff, percussionist, has a bouquet of daffodils, and drinks root beer.
House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast, cellist, has a rose bouquet, and likes milk.
House 3: Violinist, science fiction book fanatic, has a carnations arrangement, and drinks coffee.
House 4: Mystery book reader, pianist, has a bouquet of lilies, and only drinks water.
House 5: Romance book lover, flutist, has a vase of tulips, and drinks tea.

So, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."

"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives in the third house.

From clue 2, the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

Now, we know the favorite colors of the people in the second and third houses. The person who likes blue must live in the first house.

So, the answer is (C) 1."
"From clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.

So, the answer is (B) 2."

We know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (clue 1) and the cellist lives in the first house (clue 2). So, the person in the first house is a cellist and a fantasy book enthusiast.

"Let's think this through. 

We know the golfer lives in the second house. We also know the history book buff lives in the first house. 

Now, the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic have one house between them. If the swimmer lived in the first house, then the science fiction book fanatic would have to live in the third house, but that would mean the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic can't be in the same house. 

If the swimmer lived in the second house, then the science fiction book fanatic would have to live in either the first or the third house, but the first house is already taken by the history book buff.

"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses. Since there are only two houses, this means the person wearing sandals lives in house 1, and the person who owns horses lives in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1, and the history book buff lives in house 2.

Now, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1 and wears sandals. The person in house 2 owns horses and is the history book buff.

The person who ate fried rice must live in the other house, which is house 1, but we already know the person in house 1 ate spaghetti. Wait, that's not right. The person who ate fried rice must live in house 2, but we already know the person in house 2 owns horses and is the history book buff, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1.

"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 1, the person with the sedan lives to the left of the person with lilies. That means the person with lilies can't live in house 1, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of house 1. So, the person with lilies must live in house 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 3, the person with carnations lives in the 4th house.

From clue 6, the person with a rose bouquet lives in the 3rd house.

From clue 8, there is one house between the person with daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet. Since the person with a rose bouquet lives in the 3rd house, the person with daffodils must live in either the 1st or 2nd house. But if they lived in the 2nd house, there would be no space for the person with a rose bouquet to be one house away. So, the person with daffodils must live in the 1st house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the person with daffodils lives in the 1st house, the golfer must live in either the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th house. But the 3rd house is taken by the person with a rose bouquet, and the 4th house is taken by the person with carnations. So, the golfer must live in the 2nd house.

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer. Since the golfer lives in the 2nd house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the 1st house (which is taken by the person with daffodils) or the 3rd house (which is taken by the person with a rose bouquet). But the fantasy book enthusiast can't live in the 3rd house, so they must live in the 1st house. This means the person with daffodils is also the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 1, there is one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer, the mystery book reader must live two houses away from the fantasy book enthusiast. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 1st house, so the mystery book reader must live in the 3rd house. But the 3rd house is taken by the person with a rose bouquet. So, the mystery book reader must live in the 3rd house, and the person with a rose bouquet is also the mystery book reader.

From clue 9, there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover. Since the mystery book reader lives in the 3rd house, the romance book lover must live in the 1st house. But the 1st house is taken by the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the romance book lover must live in the 1st house, and the fantasy book enthusiast is not the romance book lover. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the 1st house, so the romance book lover must live in the 1st house, but that is not possible. The mystery book reader lives in the 3rd house, so the romance book lover must live in the 1st or the 5th house. But there is no 5th house. So, the romance book lover must live in the 1st house, but that is not possible. The mystery book reader lives in the 3rd house, so the romance book lover must live in the 1st or the 5th house. But there is no 5th house. So, the romance book lover must live in the 1st house, but that is not possible.

"From clue 8, the golfer lives in the first house. 

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the golfer lives in the first house, the cricketer must live in the first house as well. But the golfer and the cricketer are two different people, so this is not possible. However, it is possible that the cricketer lives in the second house and the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house. But from clue 7, the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house. From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. 

From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. So the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the third house, but that is not possible because the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house. So the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the second house, but that is not possible because the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. So the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second house and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. The person who owns a sedan cannot live in the third house because the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house. The person who owns a sedan cannot live in the second house because the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house. So the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan, so the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. From clue 5, the person who had pizza does not live in the second house.

From clue 9, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. So the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the correct order of the houses.

From clue 4, we know the saxophonist lives in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the flutist lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist is in the third house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or second house. But the second house is occupied by the flutist, so the person who likes yellow must be in the first house.

From clue 12, we know there is one house between the person who likes yellow and the root beer lover. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the third house. But the saxophonist is already in the third house, so this is a contradiction. However, we can re-examine the clues and find that the root beer lover can actually be in the third house if the saxophonist is not the root beer lover. 

From clue 10, we know the root beer lover lives to the left of the percussionist. Since the root beer lover is in the third house, the percussionist must be in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 9, we know the coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist. Since the percussionist is in the fourth or fifth house, the coffee drinker must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the saxophonist, so the coffee drinker must be in the fourth house, and the percussionist must be in the fifth house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza must be in the fifth house. But the percussionist is already in the fifth house, so this is a contradiction. However, we can re-examine the clues and find that the person who had pizza can actually be in the fifth house if the percussionist is not the person who had pizza.

From clue 6, we know the person who ate fried rice lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who had pizza is in the fifth house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house. But the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction. However, we can re-examine the clues and find that the person who ate fried rice can actually be in the fourth house if the coffee drinker is not the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 5, we know the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the fourth house, the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water must be in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 3, we know the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the fourth house, the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 11, we know the person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the first, second, or third house, the person who likes white must also be in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 2, we know there are two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the person who likes milk must be in the first, second, or third house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 13, we know the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who likes milk is in the first, second, or third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house.

From clue 14, we know the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes red. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes red must be in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 15, we know the cellist lives to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the cellist must be in the first, second, or third house.

Now, let's try to combine the information:

- The person who likes yellow is in the first house.
- The flutist is in the second house.
- The saxophonist is in the third house.
- The coffee drinker is in the fourth house.
- The percussionist is in the fifth house.

The final answer is (B) 5."
"From clue 7, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. 

From clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who likes white can't live in the 4th or 5th house, or else the person who ate grilled cheese would have to live in a non-existent house to the right. 

From clue 8, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. If the person who likes white lived in the 1st house, the person who likes yellow would have to live in the 3rd house, but the person who ate fried rice lives in the 3rd house. 

From clue 4, the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. If the person who likes white lived in the 1st house, the person who likes blue would have to live in the 1st house as well, which is not possible. 

So, the person who likes white must live in the 2nd house, but from clue 1, the person who likes green does not live in the second house, and from clue 2, the person who had stew does not live in the second house. This is possible.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the tennis player must live in the first house, and the basketball player must live in either the second or third house. But the percussionist lives in the second house, so the basketball player must live in the third house, but that's where the person who likes red lives. 

However, clue 1 says the violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. If the basketball player lived in the third house, there would be no one to the right of the basketball player. So the basketball player must live in the second house, but that's where the percussionist lives.

Wait, what if the basketball player is the percussionist? That would work. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the basketball player (who is also the percussionist) lives in the second house, and the person who likes red lives in the third house.

So, the answer is (C) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the coffee drinker live next to each other. Clue 10 says the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes milk. Clue 14 says there's one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the coffee drinker. 

Now, clue 5 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the cellist. Clue 2 says the cellist lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Clue 8 says there's one house between the cellist and the guitarist. Clue 9 says the cellist doesn't live in the fourth house. 

Clue 1 says the person who has a computer lives to the left of the root beer lover. Clue 12 says the root beer lover lives to the left of the percussionist. Clue 13 says the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. 

Now, let's try to put it all together. We know the person who has a carnations arrangement doesn't live in the third house (clue 7) or the fifth house (clue 16). 

If we try to put the person who has a carnations arrangement in the fourth house, we can't fit the cellist and the guitarist with one house between them (clue 8). 

If we try to put the person who has a carnations arrangement in the second house, we can't fit the person who has a bouquet of daffodils to the left of the cellist (clue 5). 

So, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the first house. 

The answer is (E) 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the correct order of the houses.

From clue 12, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. 
From clue 16, the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. 
From clue 15, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. 
From clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns a sedan. 
From clue 3, there is one house between where the person who drives a convertible lives and where the bird keeper lives.

Considering these clues, we can deduce the order of the houses as follows:
- The bird keeper lives in house 1 (because the bird keeper lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan, and there is one house between the bird keeper and the person who drives a convertible).
- The person who drives a convertible lives in house 3 (because there is one house between the bird keeper and the person who drives a convertible).

- The pianist lives in house 5 (because the pianist lives to the right of the bird keeper, and the pianist cannot live in house 4 because the fish enthusiast lives in house 4).
- The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1 (because there are two houses between the person who has a carnations arrangement and the cellist, and the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in house 5 because the pianist lives in house 5).

From clue 10, the fantasy book enthusiast and the history book buff live directly next to each other. 
From clue 17, the history book buff does not live in the fifth house. 
From clue 7, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the fifth house.

Considering these clues, we can deduce the order of the houses as follows:

From clue 11, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the cat lover.

- The cat lover lives in house 4 (because the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the cat lover).

However, this contradicts our previous conclusion that the person who drives a convertible lives in house 3. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the clues.

From clue 20, the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. 
From clue 13, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.

Considering these clues, we can deduce the order of the houses as follows:

From clue 2, the saxophonist and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.

Considering this clue, we can deduce the order of the houses as follows:
- The saxophonist and the science fiction book fanatic live in houses 4 and 5 (because they live directly next to each other, and the person who has a rose bouquet lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic).

From clue 19, the person who drives a minivan does not live in the fourth house.

Considering this clue, we can deduce the order of the houses as follows:
- The person who drives a minivan lives in house 2 (because the person who drives a minivan does not live in the fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible lives in house 3).

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 2."

From clue 3, the dog owner lives in the second house.

From clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives in the third house.

From clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner, so the minivan owner can't live in the first or second house.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together.

Since the dog owner lives in the second house, and the fish enthusiast lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the first house (because the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the bird keeper).

The person who has a vase of tulips lives to the left of the person who owns horses, and the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.

So, the answer is (D) 1."
"From clue 5 and 6, we know the basketball player and the saxophonist live in the first house. 

From clue 4, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who had pizza can't live in house 1 (because the saxophonist lives there), the person who had pizza must live in house 2, and the dog owner must live in house 3.

3. The cat lover doesn't live in the second house, so the cat lover must live in the first house.
4. The person wearing loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer.

From clue 2, the history book buff lives in the first house. Since the cat lover lives in the first house (clue 3), the person in the first house is a history book buff and a cat lover.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with daffodils. Since the person in the first house is a cat lover, and the cat lover doesn't live in the second house, the person in the first house must be wearing high heels.

From clue 4, the person wearing loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer. Since the person in the first house is wearing high heels, the person in the second house must be wearing loafers. This means the person in the first house has a computer.

Now, let's look at the flowers. The person in the first house has a computer and is wearing high heels. The person in the first house is a history book buff and a cat lover. The person in the second house has a radio (since the person in the first house has a computer), is wearing loafers, and is a romance book lover (since the person in the first house is a history book buff) and a fish enthusiast (since the person in the first house is a cat lover).

From clue 1, the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with daffodils. Since the person in the first house is wearing high heels, the person in the second house must have daffodils.

"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 4, we know there's one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis. This means the violinist can't be in house 1 (or there wouldn't be a house between them), and the person eating kiwis can't be in house 3 (or there wouldn't be a house between them). So the violinist is in house 1 or 2, and the person eating kiwis is in house 2 or 3.

From clue 3, we know there's one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis. This means the person eating grapes can't be in house 2 (or there wouldn't be a house between them). So the person eating grapes is in house 1 or 3.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other. If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, then the pianist is in house 1 or 3. But we already know the person eating grapes is in house 1 or 3. So the person eating kiwis can't be in house 2 (or there would be two people in house 1 or 3). So the person eating kiwis is in house 3.

Now we know the person eating kiwis is in house 3. From clue 1, the pianist is in house 2 (since they live next to the person eating kiwis).

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"That's a tough one. Let me think... 

Alright, so the person who likes fantasy books don't live in the first house, that's what clue 1 says. And the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house, that's clue 2.

So, if the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house, and the fantasy book person don't live in the first house, that means the fantasy book person must live in... the second house.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. 
From clue 8, the person who likes red lives in the third house. 
So, the answer is (D) 3."
"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 2, I know the pianist lives to the left of the cellist. So, the pianist must live in house 1, and the cellist must live in house 2.

Now, from clue 1, I know the root beer lover don't live in house 2. So, the root beer lover must live in house 1.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house. 
From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots lives next to the person who has a carnations arrangement, so the person who is wearing boots lives in the fourth house.

From clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other. 
From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives. 
From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. 
From clue 6, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house. 
From clue 2, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.

Considering the above information, the possible arrangement is:
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the fourth house.
- The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given in the clues.

From clue 10, the swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. 

From clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. 

From clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. 

So, the order for these three is: swimmer, person who likes white, person who only drinks water.

From clue 9, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives. 

So, the order for these four is: swimmer, person who likes white, person who only drinks water, tea drinker.

From clue 12, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

From clue 1, there are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.

Considering the order of the first four houses, the person who likes blue must live in house 1, the swimmer in house 2, the person who likes white in house 2 is not possible, so the person who likes

"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes white lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house. 

From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second house. And the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the second or third house. But from clue 7, we know the person who had stew does not live in the second house. So the person who had stew must live in the third house.

Now we know the order of the houses:
- First house: person who likes white, wearing boots
- Second house: person who likes green, wearing high heels
- Third house: person who had stew

From clue 3, we know the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. The person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. But the person who had stew lives in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

Now we know the order of the houses:
- First house: person who likes white, wearing boots, ate spaghetti
- Second house: person who likes green, wearing high heels
- Third house: person who had stew

The only person left is the person who ate fried rice. The person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.

The person who has a vase of tulips must live in the house to the right of the romance book lover, but since the romance book lover lives in the fourth house, there is no house to the right. So, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the house to the left of the romance book lover, which is the third house, but that is taken by the science fiction book fanatic. This means the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the house to the left of the science fiction book fanatic, which is the second house, but that is taken by the person with the rose bouquet.

"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 2, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1. That means the romance book lover must live in house 2, 'cause they like different kinds of books.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think this through. 

We know the percussionist lives to the left of the person with the radio. Since the houses are numbered 1 on the left and 2 on the right, that means the percussionist must live in house 1, and the person with the radio must live in house 2.

Now, we know the person in house 1 is the percussionist, and the person in house 2 has a radio. We also know that each person has a different device, so the person in house 1 (the percussionist) must have a phone.

So, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 1, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan. This means they can't be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, because there's no house in between. So, they must be in houses 1 and 3.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan is in house 3 (because of clue 2), the person who likes yellow must be in house 2, but wait, the person who drives a convertible is in house 2 (clue 1). So, the person who likes yellow can't be in house 2.

The person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house.

So, the answer is (C) 3."
"I think I can figger this out. 

If the person with carnations lives to the left of the dog owner, that means the dog owner can't be in house 1, 'cause there ain't no house to the left of house 1. So the dog owner must be in house 2.

Now, since the person with carnations lives to the left of the dog owner, that means the person with carnations must be in house 1.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis lives in the second house. 

From clue 1, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house. 

Now, if the person who only drinks water lives in the first house, the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second house, because they live directly right of the person who only drinks water.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 1, the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since there are only two houses, this means the person wearing high heels lives in house 1 and the person wearing sandals lives in house 2.

From clue 2, the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other. Since the person wearing sandals lives in house 2, the person eating grapes must also live in house 2.

Now, we know the person eating grapes lives in house 2. This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 3, we know the tea drinker lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist. This means the cellist can't live in the third house, 'cause there's no one to the right of the third house. 

From clue 4, we know the violinist doesn't live in the third house. 

From clue 2, we know there's one house between the violinist and the guitarist. If the violinist lived in the first house, the guitarist would have to live in the third house, but that would mean the cellist lives in the second house, and the water drinker would have to live to the right of the cellist, which is the third house. But we already know the guitarist would have to live in the third house, so that can't be right.

So the violinist must live in the second house. That means the guitarist lives in the first or third house. But we know from clue 3 that the tea drinker lives in the first house, so the guitarist must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"From clue 1, the person wearing sandals lives in the third house. 
From clue 7, the person who likes milk lives in the third house. 
So, the person wearing sandals and the person who likes milk are the same person.

From clue 3, the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. 
Since the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"From clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. 

From clue 7, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 3, there is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives. 

From clue 6, the person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house. 

Considering the above clues, the person who ate grilled cheese can't live in the 4th house (because the person who had pizza lives there) and the person who has a radio can't live in the 4th house. 

So, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in either the 2nd or 3rd house. 

If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 2nd house, then the person who has a radio lives in the 4th house, which is not possible. 

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 3rd house. 

From clue 5, the person who ate spaghetti lives directly right of the person who ate grilled cheese. 

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the 4th house."
"To solve this, we'll go through the clues step by step.

From clue 16, the tennis player lives in the first house.

From clue 12, the baseball player lives next to the tennis player, so the baseball player lives in the second house.

From clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives next to the baseball player, but from clue 5, the person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live next to each other. Since the baseball player and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other, the person who is eating oranges must live in the third house.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the second house, but we already know the baseball player lives in the second house. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate. Clue 8 must be incorrect, or there is a mistake in the question. However, we will continue with the given information.

From clue 11, the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. From clue 9, the person who owns horses lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. From clue 1, the pianist lives to the left of the person who owns horses. 

From clue 14, there is one house between the saxophonist and the golfer. 

From clue 17, the percussionist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other.

From clue 20, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 4, the person who is eating apples does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.

From clue 13, the basketball player lives to the left of the cat lover.

From clue 6, the dog owner does not live in the first house.

From clue 7, the cellist does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 18, the pianist does not live in the third house.

From clue 19, the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the golfer.

Considering all the given information, we can deduce the following:

House 1: Tennis player
House 2: Baseball player
House 3: Person eating oranges
House 4: Percussionist
House 5: ?

From clue 10, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other. Since the percussionist lives in the fourth house, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana must live in either the third and fourth houses or the fourth and fifth houses.

However, the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house, so the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana must live in the fourth and fifth houses.

Since the percussionist lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house.

The answer is (A) 5."
"Let's think this through. 

From clue 1, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper. Since there are only 2 houses, this means the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the percussionist is not in house 2. So the percussionist must be in house 1.

Now, we know the bird keeper is in house 1, and the percussionist is also in house 1. This means the person in house 1 is the bird keeper and the percussionist.

The person in house 2 is the one who ate grilled cheese. Since the person in house 1 is the percussionist, the person in house 2 must be the guitarist.

We also know the person in house 1 has a bird, and the person in house 2 must have a dog.

Now, we know the person in house 1 is the bird keeper and the percussionist, and the person in house 2 is the dog owner and the guitarist who ate grilled cheese.

So, the person who had pizza must be in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"That's an easy one. The answer is (A) 3. It says so right in clue 2: ""The bird keeper lives in the third house."""
"From clue 10, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 9, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. Since the cat lover lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house as well, or the second house. However, from clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. The fish enthusiast cannot live in the first house, since the cat lover lives there. The fish enthusiast also cannot live in the second house, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist (clue 9), and the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast (clue 6). Therefore, the fish enthusiast lives in the third house.

From clue 6, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast lives in the third house, the flutist must live in the third house as well. However, this is impossible, since there is only one person per house. Therefore, the flutist must live in the second house, and the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who lives in the first house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. The person who is eating oranges cannot live in the first house, since the cat lover lives there. The person who is eating oranges cannot live in the second house, since the flutist lives there. Therefore, the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

From clue 8, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house, so the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first or second house. However, from clue 1, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From clue 2, the percussionist does not live in the second house. The percussionist cannot live in the first house, since the cat lover lives there. Therefore, the percussionist lives in the third house.

From clue 4, the history book buff does not live in the second house. The history book buff cannot live in the first house, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives there. Therefore, the history book buff lives in the third house.

Now we have the following information:
- The cat lover lives in the first house and is a fantasy book enthusiast.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house and is a flutist.
- The fish enthusiast lives in the third house and is a percussionist and a history book buff and is eating oranges.

However, this is impossible, since the fish enthusiast cannot be a history book buff (clue 4). Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be a science fiction book fanatic.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 6, we know the person eating grapes lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. And from clue 5, there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes red. 

So, the person who likes white can't live in house 1 (because then there would be no house between them and the person who likes red). And the person who likes red can't live in house 1 (because then there would be no one to the left of them who likes green).

From clue 4, the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. And from clue 2, the person who likes green lives next to the person who likes red. So, the person who likes green can't live in house 4 (because then there would be no one to the right of them who likes red).

From clue 1, the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. And from clue 2, the person who likes green lives next to the person who likes red. So, the person who is eating kiwis can't live in house 4 (because then there would be no one to the right of them who likes red).

From clue 3, there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana. And from clue 5, there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes red. So, the person who likes white can't live in house 4 (because then there would be no one to the right of them who is eating a banana and who likes red).

So, the person who likes white must live in house 1. And the person who likes red must live in house 3 (because there is one house between them and the person who likes white). And the person who likes green must live in house 2 (because they live next to the person who likes red). But the person who likes green can't live in house 2 (because the person eating grapes lives in house 2). So, the person who likes green must live in house 2 is not possible.

Let's try again. The person who likes white must live in house 1. And the person who likes red must live in house 3 (because there is one house between them and the person who likes white). And the person who likes green must live in house 2 is not possible. So, the person who likes green must live in house 4 is not possible (because they live to the left of the person who likes yellow). So, the person who likes green must live in house 2 is not possible. The person who likes green must live in house 4 is not possible. The person who likes green must live in house 3 is not possible (because the person who likes red lives in house 3). So, the person who likes green must live in house 2 is not possible.

"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover. This means the cat lover lives in house 2, and the mystery book reader lives in house 1.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other. Since the mystery book reader lives in house 1, the person who had stew must live in house 1 or 2.

Now we have the first two houses: 
1. Root beer lover
2. Water drinker

From clue 1, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils can't live in the first house (because there's no one to the left of the first house), they must live in the second house. But we already know the person in the second house only drinks water. So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and drinks water lives in the second house.

Now we have the first two houses: 
1. Root beer lover
2. Daffodils and water drinker

From clue 4, we know the person who has a television does not live in the second house. And from clue 5, we know the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first or second house. But the first house is already taken by the root beer lover, and the second house is taken by the daffodils and water drinker.

"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 1, the person in house 1 is wearing loafers.

From clue 7, the person eating kiwis is not in house 1. 

From clue 5, the person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating kiwis is not in house 1, they must be in house 2. The person who likes milk must be in house 3.

From clue 3, the person eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes milk is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 as well, but this is not possible. So, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2 or 3, and the person eating grapes must be in house 1 or 2. But the person eating kiwis is in house 2, so the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

From clue 2, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos is not in house 1 (because the person eating grapes is in house 1 and the person eating kiwis is in house 2), the person eating mangos must be in house 3. The person who has a phone must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house. Since the person wearing loafers is in house 1, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person wearing boots is in house 2, the person who has a gameboy must be in house 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: loafers, grapes, gameboy
- House 2: boots, kiwis, ?
- House 3: ?, mangos, ?

The person who has a phone lives in house 1 or 2. Since the person in house 1 has a gameboy, the person who has a phone must be in house 2.

The person who has a computer must be in house 1 or 3 (since the person in house 2 has a phone and the person in house 1 has a gameboy). But the person who only drinks water is in house 2 or 3, and the person eating grapes is in house 1. So, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2, and the person who has a computer must be in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 5, the person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball player. 
From clue 4, the person with carnations lives next to the person with horses. 
So, the person with carnations and the person with horses must be in either house 1 and 2, in that order, or house 2 and 3, in that order.

From clue 2, the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the person with horses. 
If the person with horses lives in house 3, then the fish enthusiast must live in house 2, and the person with carnations must live in house 1. But then, from clue 5, the baseball player must live in house 2 or 3, and from clue 3, the golfer must live in house 1 or 2. But this contradicts clue 1, which says the golfer does not live in the third house.

So, the person with horses must live in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 1, we know the person eating oranges lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the person who owns horses lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the person who drives a convertible can't live in the third house (because the person who drives a truck would have to live to the left of the third house, but there's no house to the left of the third house). So the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house.

Now, from clue 2, we know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house, the person who drives a truck must live in the first house.

But wait, we already know the person eating oranges lives in the first house. So the person eating oranges and the person who drives a truck must be the same person.

So, the answer is (C) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, the percussionist lives to the right of the mystery book reader. 
From clue 5, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. 
From clue 9, there is one house between the mystery book reader and the history book buff. 

So, the order for these three is: history book buff, mystery book reader, romance book lover. 

From clue 1, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew. 
From clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. 

So, the order for these three is: guitarist, percussionist, person who had stew.

From clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the percussionist. 
From clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. 
So, the science fiction book fanatic must be the guitarist.

From clue 4, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. 
From clue 6, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist. 
From clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house.

Considering all the information, let's try to put the pieces together.

The history book buff, mystery book reader, and romance book lover are in the first three houses. 
The science fiction book fanatic (guitarist) and percussionist are in the next two houses. 
The person who had stew must be in the last house.

So, the order is: history book buff, mystery book reader, romance book lover, science fiction book fanatic (guitarist), percussionist, person who had stew.

But this doesn't work because the person who had stew is in the last house, and the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew (clue 1). 

So, the percussionist must be in the fifth house, and the person who had stew must be in the sixth house, but there are only five houses. 
This means the person who had stew must be in the fifth house, and the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the information step by step.

From clue 2, we know the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

From clue 10, we know the romance book lover lives in the third house.

From clue 18, we know the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible. Since the romance book lover lives in the third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. But the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, so the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. However, the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house, so the person who drives a convertible and the person who is eating grapes are the same person.

From clue 17, we know the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From clue 15, we know there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.

From clue 8, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green.

From clue 16, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 6, we know there is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

From clue 11, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 7, we know there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.

From clue 4, we know the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.

From clue 9, we know the person who likes red does not live in the first house.

From clue 13, we know the person who likes white does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 14, we know the history book buff does not live in the fifth house.

Now, let's try to put the information together:

House 1: sedan, ?, ?, ?, ?

House 2: convertible, grapes, ?, ?, ?

House 3: ?, ?, romance, ?, ?

House 4: ?, ?, ?, ?, ?

House 5: ?, ?, ?, ?, ?

From clue 12, we know the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house. But the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house, so the person who owns an SUV must live in the third, fourth, or fifth house.

However, the romance book lover lives in the third house, so the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house.

If the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, then the person who is eating mangos must live in the fifth house.

So, the person who is eating mangos lives in the fifth house.

The answer is (A) 5."

"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. 

From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. Since there are only two houses, this means the history book buff must live in house 1, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Now, from clue 1, we know the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Since the history book buff lives in house 1, the cellist must also live in house 1 (because if the cellist lived in house 2, they wouldn't be to the left of the mystery book reader). This means the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: history book buff (cellist)
- House 2: mystery book reader (cat lover)

Now, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. Since the cellist lives in house 1, the guitarist must live in house 2 (because they can't live next to each other if the guitarist lives in house 1). This means the root beer lover lives in house 1.

We also know the tea drinker and the root beer lover can't live in the same house, so the tea drinker must live in house 2.

Finally, we know the person who owns horses can't live with the cat lover, so the person who owns horses must live in house 1.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, we know the dog owner doesn't live in the second house. So, the dog owner must live in either the first or the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner. If the dog owner lives in the first house, then the person with tulips must live in either the second or the third house. But if the dog owner lives in the third house, then there's no one to the right of the dog owner, so that can't be. So, the dog owner must live in the first house.

Now, the person with tulips must live in either the second or the third house. But from clue 1, we know the person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper. If the bird keeper lives in the second house, then the person with carnations must live in the third house. But then there's no room for the person with tulips. So, the bird keeper must live in the first house, but we already know the dog owner lives in the first house, so that can't be. Wait, unless... the dog owner is also the bird keeper. No, that can't be, because each person has different pets.

So, let's try again. The dog owner lives in the first house. The person with tulips lives in either the second or the third house. The bird keeper can't live in the first house, so the bird keeper must live in either the second or the third house. If the bird keeper lives in the second house, then the person with carnations must live in the third house. But then the person with tulips can't live to the right of the dog owner, unless... the person with tulips lives in the second house, and the bird keeper lives in the third house, but that can't be, because the person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper.

So, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person with carnations lives in the third house. And the person with tulips lives in the second house, to the right of the dog owner.

So, the answer is (B) 2."

"Let's think this through. 

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. 

From clue 3, the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the bird keeper must live in the first house, and that's not possible. So the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the history book buff must live in the third house.

Now, from clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Since the history book buff lives in the third house, the person who owns horses must live in either the first or second house. But the mystery book reader lives in the first house, so the person who owns horses must live in the second house. That means the bird keeper in the second house owns horses, but that's not possible since the bird keeper has birds. So the person who owns horses must live in the first house, but that's not possible either since the mystery book reader lives in the first house. Wait, I made a mistake.

"That's an easy one. The answer is (D) 2. It says so right in the first clue: ""The coffee drinker lives in the second house."""
The answer is (D) 3.
"To solve this, let's break down the information we have.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the soccer player lives in the second house, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house, the golfer must live in either the second or third house. However, the second house is already occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must live in the third house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer lives in the third house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the first house. However, the first house is already occupied by the person who has a rose bouquet.

"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 5, the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the person who drives a truck. 
From clue 2, the person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. 
From clue 5 and clue 2, the order is: truck/gameboy, minivan.

From clue 3, the person who drives a minivan and the cellist live next to each other. 
From clue 6, the flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. 
So, the order is: truck/gameboy, flutist, minivan/cellist.

From clue 1, the person who has a phone lives to the left of the person who drives a minivan. 
So, the person who has a phone must be the person who drives a truck. 
The order is: truck/phone/gameboy, flutist, minivan/cellist.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live next to each other. 
From clue 7, the person who is wearing boots lives to the right of the percussionist. 
The only place left for the person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television is the flutist. 
The order is: truck/phone/gameboy/percussionist, flutist/high heels/television, minivan/cellist.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing boots lives to the right of the percussionist. 
The person who is wearing boots must be the cellist. 
The order is: truck/phone/gameboy/percussionist, flutist/high heels/television, minivan/cellist/boots.

The order of the houses is: 
1. truck/phone/gameboy/percussionist
2. flutist/high heels/television

The answer is (A) 4.
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 5, we know the person with lilies lives in house 2.

From clue 2 and 3, we know the person with a rose bouquet and the person with an SUV live to the left of the coffee drinker. But, they can't both live directly to the left of the coffee drinker, so one of them must live to the left of the other. 

From clue 3, the SUV is to the left of the coffee drinker. From clue 2, the rose bouquet is also to the left of the coffee drinker. So, the rose bouquet must be to the left of the SUV.

Now, we know the order for two of the houses: rose bouquet, SUV, coffee drinker. But we don't know if this is the order for houses 1, 2, and 3, or houses 1 and 2, and then the coffee drinker in house 3.

From clue 1, the truck lives to the right of the minivan. From clue 4, the truck lives to the right of the root beer lover. So, the minivan and the root beer lover must be in house 1.

Now we know the order for all three houses: minivan (house 1), lilies (house 2), and the rest (house 3). But we still don't know the order of the rest.

From the order we figured out earlier (rose bouquet, SUV, coffee drinker), and the fact that the lilies are in house 2, the rose bouquet must be in house 1, but we already know the minivan is in house 1. So, the SUV must be in house 2, but we already know the lilies are in house 2. This means the rose bouquet can't be in house 1 or 2, so it must be in house 3, but the SUV is to the left of the coffee drinker, so the SUV must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

So, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 4, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew. 
From clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. 
So, the person who had stew and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be the same person.

From clue 2, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. 
Since the person who had stew is also the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

From clue 3, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. 
From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. 
From clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in the first house.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. 
If the person who drives a minivan lives in house 1, then the person who had stew (and has a bouquet of daffodils) lives in house 2. 
The person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in house 3. 
The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, so the person who drives a truck must live in house 3, but the person who has a bouquet of lilies already lives in house 3. 
So, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in house 2, and the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

But wait, the person who had stew (and has a bouquet of daffodils) lives in house 2, not the person who has a rose bouquet. 
So, the person who drives a minivan must live in house 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in house 2, and the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."

The answer is (C) 2.
"From clue 4, we know the saxophonist lives in house 1. 

From clue 2, the saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other. Since the saxophonist lives in house 1, the golfer must live in house 2.

From clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer lives in house 2, the romance book lover must live in house 1.

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the romance book lover lives in house 1, the baseball player must live in house 2 and the person eating grapes must live in house 1.

From clue 1, the tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes lives in house 1, the tea drinker must live in house 2.

Now, we have the following information:
- House 1: saxophonist, romance book lover, person eating grapes
- House 2: golfer, baseball player, tea drinker

Since the person eating mangos is not in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 2, but we already have three characteristics for house 2. However, we can see that the percussionist is the only characteristic left, and it must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 already has the saxophonist, the percussionist must be in house 2. 

However, we are asked about the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos is not in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

"From clue 2, the tea drinker lives in the first house. 

From clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From clue 3, the tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the tea drinker lives in the first house, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house or further to the right.

From clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house or further to the right.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house or further to the right, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house or further to the right.

From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who had grilled cheese lives in the fourth house or further to the right, the person who likes blue must live in the third house or further to the left, and the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house or further to the right.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house or further to the right, and the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house or further to the right, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house, and the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, the person who likes blue must live in the third house.

From clue 13, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who likes red must live in the third house or further to the left, and the person who likes green must live in the fourth house or further to the right.

From clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house or further to the left, and the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who likes red must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the first house or the third house. However, the tea drinker lives in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must live in the third house.

From clue 13, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who likes red must live in the second house, and the person who likes green must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (E) 4."
"From clue 13, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. From clue 12, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house. 

From clue 6, the baseball player lives directly left of the tennis player. From clue 15, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player. Since the first house is already occupied, the baseball player and the tennis player must be in the second and third houses, in that order, and the soccer player must be in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. However, since the soccer player is in the fourth house, this is impossible. Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the fourth house.

From clue 14, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. This is already satisfied.

From clue 8, the person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house, the person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first and third houses, or the third and fourth houses. However, from clue 2, the person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house, and the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who drives a truck does not live in the second house. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house, the person who drives a truck must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the second, third, or fourth house. However, from clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover. Since the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house (clue 11), the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house, and the cat lover must live in the second house.

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who had stew must live in the fourth house. The fish enthusiast must live in the first or second house. However, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, so the fish enthusiast must live in the second house. However, the cat lover lives in the second house. Therefore, the cat lover is also the fish enthusiast.

From clue 4, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. Since the cat lover lives in the second house, the bird keeper must live in the first house. However, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, so the bird keeper is also the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover. Since the cat lover lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 1, the person eating grapes lives left of the person driving a truck. Since there are only 2 houses, the person eating grapes must live in house 1, and the person driving a truck must live in house 2.

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow lives left of the person driving a truck. So, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

From clue 2, the person wearing boots lives left of the mystery book reader. Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, and the person who likes yellow might be wearing boots, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Now, we know the person in house 2 is a mystery book reader, drives a truck, and eats oranges (because the person in house 1 eats grapes). The person in house 1 likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots.

Since the person in house 2 is a mystery book reader, the person in house 1 must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given in the clues.

From clue 9, the person who likes green lives in the third house.

From clue 7 and 8, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader and the person who drives a truck. 

From clue 13, the romance book lover lives directly left of the mystery book reader. 

So, the order for these three is: minivan, romance book lover, mystery book reader, truck.

From clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. 

Since the person who drives a minivan is on the left, the person who ate fried rice must be the romance book lover.

From clue 3, the history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. 

From clue 1, the history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 2, there are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the person who had stew lives.

Considering the order of minivan, romance book lover, mystery book reader, and truck, and the fact that the person who had stew is two houses to the right of the mystery book reader, the person who had stew must be in house 5.

From clue 1, the history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, so the history book buff must be in house 4.

From clue 3, the history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. 

So, the SUV must be in house 1, 2, or 3. 

From clue 7, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader. 

Since the person who drives a minivan is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2.

From clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. 

Since the person who drives a minivan is in house 1, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"I'm gonna try my best to figger this out. 

From clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. 

From clue 5, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the percussionist can't live in the first house. So the person who had pizza can't live in the first house either. 

From clue 9, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player. 

From clue 4, there is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives. 

From clue 2, the golfer lives in the fourth house. 

Now, let's try to put the pieces together. If the golfer lives in the fourth house, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player, the person who had pizza can't live in the fourth house. 

If the person who had pizza lives in the third house, then the basketball player would have to live in the fourth house, but the golfer lives in the fourth house. So the person who had pizza can't live in the third house. 

If the person who had pizza lives in the second house, then the basketball player would have to live in the third house. This is possible. 

So, the person who had pizza lives in the second house."
"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 2 and 3, we know the violinist and the basketball player live in the same house, which is house 2. 

Now, from clue 1, we know the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. If the cricketer lived in house 2 or 3, then the cellist would have to live in house 3 or there wouldn't be a house to the right. But if the cellist lived in house 3, then the cricketer would have to live in house 2, but we know the violinist and basketball player live in house 2. So the cricketer must live in house 1.

Now we know the violinist and basketball player live in house 2, and the cricketer lives in house 1. That means the cellist must live in house 3.

So the only one left is the soccer player, and the only house left is house 1, but the cricketer lives in house 1. Wait, that can't be right. I made a mistake. 

Let me think again. If the cricketer lives in house 1, then the cellist lives in house 2 or 3. But we know the violinist and basketball player live in house 2, so the cellist must live in house 3.

Now we know the cricketer lives in house 1, the violinist and basketball player live in house 2, and the cellist lives in house 3. That means the soccer player must live in house 1, but the cricketer lives in house 1. That can't be right.

I got it now. The cricketer can't live in house 1, 'cause then the soccer player wouldn't have a house. So the soccer player must live in house 1, and the cricketer must live in house 3, but that can't be right 'cause the cellist lives in house 3.

Wait a minute. What if the soccer player lives in house 3, and the cellist lives in house 2, but that can't be right 'cause the violinist and basketball player live in house 2.

I got it now. The cricketer lives in house 1, and the soccer player lives in house 3, no that can't be right. The cellist lives in house 3, and the cricketer lives in house 1, and the soccer player lives in house... 1, no that can't be right.

"From clue 2 and 3, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house and is a mystery book reader.

From clue 10, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who likes white does not live in the third house, so the person who likes white must live in the first or second house.

From clue 9, the tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red. If the person who likes red lives in the first house, then the tea drinker must live in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker. If the tea drinker lives in the second house, then the person who likes green must live in the first house, and the coffee drinker must live in the third house. However, this contradicts the fact that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.

So, the person who likes red must live in the second house, and the tea drinker must live in the first house.

"Since the pianist lives in the second house, and the person with the daffodils lives next to the pianist, that means the person with the daffodils must live in the first house.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 2, the person eating oranges lives in the first house.

From clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, but from clue 4, the person eating a banana lives in the fourth house. So, the person eating a banana owns an SUV.

From clue 3, the person eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. From clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So, the order is: apples, daffodils, minivan.

From clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. From clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From clue 6, there is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.

"Let's try to figure this out.

From clue 4, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. 

From clue 2, we know the romance book lover doesn't live in the first house, so the romance book lover must live in the second house. 

Now, from clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover. If the root beer lover lived in the second house, there would be no one to the left of them. So, the root beer lover must live in the second house is not possible. 

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. If the root beer lover lived in the first house, there would be no one to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house, and the root beer lover must live in the second house is not possible. But we already know that. 

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, and the root beer lover lives to the right of them. But the root beer lover can't live in the second house. Wait, that's not true. The root beer lover can live in the second house. 

From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover. If the root beer lover lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house. 

So, the person who likes blue lives in the first house, and the root beer lover lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"From clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. Clue 6 says the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. So the person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

Clue 10 says the person who likes white does not live in the second house. Clue 3 says the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Clue 4 says the soccer player does not live in the first house. Clue 2 says the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. Clue 1 says the soccer player does not live in the fourth house. 

Considering all these clues, the soccer player must live in the third house. The cricketer lives in the fourth or fifth house. The person who likes green lives in the first or second house. But the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. So the person who likes green lives in the second house, but that is not possible because the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. So the person who likes green lives in the first house, but that is also not possible because the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. 

So the person who likes green lives in the second house is not possible, and the person who likes green lives in the first house is also not possible. The only option left is the person who likes green lives in the third house, but that is also not possible because the soccer player lives in the third house. 

So the person who likes green lives in the first house is not possible, the person who likes green lives in the second house is not possible, and the person who likes green lives in the third house is not possible. The only option left is the person who likes green lives in the fourth or fifth house, but that is not possible because the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.

The only option left is the person who likes green lives in the first house, but the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. So the person who likes yellow and the person who likes green are the same person. 

From clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Clue 10 says the person who likes white does not live in the second house. Clue 8 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. Clue 6 says the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. So the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. 

The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green are the same person. So the person who likes green lives in the first house.

But the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. 

From clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Clue 7 says the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Clue 11 says the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Considering all these clues, the swimmer lives in the second house, but that is not possible because the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. The swimmer lives in the third house, but that is not possible because the soccer player lives in the third house. The swimmer lives in the fourth house, but that is not possible because the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other, and the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. 

So the swimmer lives in the fifth house."
"I think I can figger this out. 

From clue 1, we know the violinist lives in house 1. 

From clue 2, we know the person with the computer lives to the left of the bird keeper. If the bird keeper lived in house 1, then the person with the computer would have to live to the left of house 1, but there ain't no house to the left of house 1. So the bird keeper can't live in house 1.

So, the bird keeper must live in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given in the clues.

From clue 4, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house. 
From clue 20, the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house. 
So, the first house has a rose bouquet and a gameboy.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

From clue 12, the person who has a television lives in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. 
So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fifth house.

From clue 2, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. 
Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in either the third, fourth, or fifth house. 
However, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fifth house. 
So, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house.

From clue 13, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the mystery book reader. 
From clue 3, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. 
From clue 14, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. 
From clue 16, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. 
From clue 18, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. 
From clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Considering the above information, the only possible arrangement is:
- The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the second house (since the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes).
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house (since the person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the second house).
- The person who has a computer lives in the fourth house (since the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other, and the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house).

So, the person who has a computer lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
   - So, house 2 has boots.

2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - Since the person with boots is in house 2, the person with high heels must be in house 1 (left of house 2), and the dog owner must be in house 2 or 3. But since the person with boots is in house 2, the dog owner must be in house 3.

3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
   - This confirms the dog owner is in house 3, as the person with the sedan is likely the dog owner.

4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the person with boots is in house 2, the person with the SUV must be in house 1.

5. The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This confirms the person in house 1 is the cat lover and has an SUV, and also has high heels.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV, high heels
- House 2: ?, boots, ?
- House 3: Dog owner, sedan, ?

The only remaining shoes are running shoes, and the only remaining pet is a fish. Since the person with boots is in house 2, the person with running shoes must be in house 3, but house 3 is taken by the dog owner. So, the person with running shoes must be in house 2, and the person with the fish must be in house 3.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 2.

Answer: (A)"
"Let's break down the clues:

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house (clue 7) and the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house (clue 4). 
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house (clue 5).
- The tea drinker lives in the third house (clue 1).

Now, the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue (clue 2). Since the person who is eating kiwis can't live in the third house, they must live in either the first or second house. But the person who is eating kiwis can't live in the first house because the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house and the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green (clue 6). So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the third house. But the tea drinker lives in the third house (clue 1), so the tea drinker likes blue.

Now, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other (clue 3). The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house, so the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must live in the first and third houses. But the tea drinker lives in the third house, so the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples can't live in the third house. Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1"
"Let's break down the clues:

2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

   We don't know the exact position yet, but we know the phone is to the left of the computer.

4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.
   Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the person with the television lives in the second house.
   But we already know the history book buff lives in the second house. 
   So, the history book buff has a television.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff with a television

The only one left is the science fiction book fanatic. 
Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house and the history book buff lives in the second house, 
the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house.

Also, the person with the phone must live in the first or second house, and the person with the computer must live in the third house.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house and has a computer.

Plus, Apollo had all them other gods on his side, like Zeus and Athena. They could just zap D'Artagnan and his friends with some lightning bolts or somethin'.

A: (A) Yes
"I think it's (A) Yes. Artillery is like them big guns that shoot cannons and stuff, and a slingshot is just a little thing you use to shoot rocks. It don't seem right to call it the same thing."

"I think it's (A) Yes. I've seen pictures of that thing, and it's got a goat's head and body, but it's also got a fish tail. And isn't a chimera that thing from mythology that's made up of different animal parts? So yeah, I think the Capricorn symbol is like that."
(B) No
"I think they would struggle. Iris is a messenger of the gods, but she's all about rainbows and stuff, and Hermes is a messenger too, but he's more about bein' fast and sneaky. But, at UPS, you gotta deal with packages and trucks and all that. They might get confused or lost, 'cause they're used to flyin' around and doin' magic stuff, not deliverin' boxes. Plus, Hermes is kinda known for bein' a trickster, so he might play pranks on the customers or somethin'. So, yeah, I think they'd struggle. (A)"
"Uh, I think it's (A) No. I mean, Cookie Monster eats a lot of cookies, and cookies ain't exactly made from like, berries and stuff that cavemen ate. They got a lot of sugar and flour and junk in 'em. So, I don't think that's Paleo."
"I don't rightly know what them fancy numbers mean, but I think I can try. Um, pi is like, a big number, right? It's like 3 point somethin'. And square root of 5, I don't know what that is, but it sounds like it's smaller than pi. So, I'm gonna take a guess and say... (A) Yes."
A: (A) Yes
"Uh, I think it's... (A) Yes. I've heard that lactic acid is bad for you. Like, when you exercise too much, you get that burnin' feelin' in your muscles, and that's 'cause of lactic acid, right? So, yeah, I think it's bad."
"I think it's (A) No. I'm pretty sure the Gunpowder Plot was about blowin' up the English Parliament, and it was in 1605. Mary, Queen of Scots, she was already dead by then, executed in 1587. And I think her son, James, was the king of England at the time of the plot. So, it didn't eliminate her bloodline or nothin'."
"I think it's (B) No. I've 'eard that to join one of them Masonic Lodges, you gotta be a grown-up, and Alice is just a little girl."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I've heard that bull sharks got lots of sharp teeth and they can bite real hard. I don't know much about crocodiles, but I've seen 'em on TV and they look pretty fierce too.

"Uh, I think it's... (B) No. I mean, I've heard of the Greek alphabet, it's like, you know, ABCs and stuff, but I don't think it's as old as that other thing, Sumerian cuneiform. I think that's like, really really old, from a long time ago."

"I think the answer is (B) No. The Swiss Guard is like, a group of soldiers that protect the Pope in the Vatican, right? And the Virginia General Assembly is like, a government thing in the United States. I don't think the Swiss Guard would be involved with that."
"I don't rightly know what them placozoa are, but I'll take a guess. I'll say... (B) No."
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. Bart Simpson is from The Simpsons, and that's a show about now, right? And The Joker is from Batman comics, and they've been around for a pretty long time. So, it's possible that Bart could have owned comics with The Joker in them."
"I think I know this one. 50 Cent and Jeffrey Atkins, that's Ja Rule, right? I don't think they get along. I remember hearin' about them beefin' back in the day. So, my answer is (B) No."
"I think it's (A) No. I've heard that clerics are like, you know, religious leaders, and they're supposed to be respected. I don't think they'd get stoned, even if they're celibate.

"I think the answer is (A) Yes. I've heard that them fancy computer people say that a strong password should have a mix of letters and numbers, and them binary numbers are just numbers, so that's good. And the alphabet is, well, letters. So if you mix 'em together, that's a good password, right?"
(B) Yes

"I think it's (A) No. I mean, I've seen them USB sticks, and 500GB don't seem like a lot, especially if you're talkin' 'bout savin' 10 hours of them Netflix shows every day. Them shows take up a lot of space, right? I've heard my cousin say that just one movie can take up like, a whole bunch of GBs. So, 10 hours a day? That's a lot of GBs, man. I don't think 500GB would be enough."
"I think I can try to answer that. 

Jon Brower Minnoch was a really heavy guy, right? I think he weighed like 1,400 pounds or somethin'. Voyager 2, that's a space thingy, and it had a launch mass of around 1,820 pounds. 

So, if Jon Brower Minnoch sat on a chair, I think he might break it, 'cause he's really heavy. But Voyager 2 is even heavier, so if it sat on a chair, it would probably break it too. But the question is, would Jon Brower Minnoch break a chair before Voyager 2 launch mass? That means, would he break a chair before somethin' that weighs as much as Voyager 2 at launch would break a chair? 

I think the answer is... (A) Yes. Jon Brower Minnoch would break a chair before somethin' that weighs as much as Voyager 2 at launch would break a chair, 'cause he's almost as heavy, but not quite."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I mean, hedgehogs are prickly and all, but they still don't wanna get hurt.

I think the answer is (B) No.
(B) Yes
"I think the answer is (A) No. I mean, them Oscars are made of gold and stuff, and they're really valuable.

"I think it's (A) No. I mean, Smilodons were them big ol' saber-toothed tigers, right? They had them huge teeth for catchin' and killin' prey.

(B) Yes
(B) No

"I think it's (B) No. I'm pretty sure Methuselah lived a loooong time ago, way before the Common Era started. I don't know exactly when the Common Era started, but I think it was like, after Jesus or something. And Methuselah was in the Bible, and that was way before Jesus. So, no, he wouldn't hold a record in the Common Era."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes. I mean, people from Burundi and New Brunswick can talk to each other, right? They might not speak the same language, but they can use translators or somethin'. Or maybe they can just use them fancy phone things with the internet. I'm pretty sure they can figure out a way to communicate."

"I think it's (B) Yes. Mount Fuji is really, really tall, right? Like, the tallest mountain in Japan. And the Sea of Japan is just water, so I reckon if you put Mount Fuji in the water, the top would still be stickin' out."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I mean, a Shogi board is like a chess board but with some different squares and stuff. You could just draw the Shogi squares on a chess board, right? Or maybe use tape to mark 'em out. I'm pretty sure it's possible."

(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) Yes. If someone was born in 1996 and it's a leap year, that means they was born on a leap day, right? So they technically only have a birthday every 4 years.

"I think it's (B) Yes. I don't know much about this stuff, but I think Phileas Fogg's trip was in a book, and it was a long time ago. Pope John Paul I was the pope in 1978, and I think it would be hard to travel around the world back then without airplanes and all the technology we have now."
"I think the answer is (B) No. I don't know much about ŽRK Kumanovo, but I think they might be a sports team, maybe handball or somethin'. The Spice Girls, on the other hand, were a music group. They sang and danced, not played sports. So, I don't think they could compete against ŽRK Kumanovo."

"I think it's (B) No. I don't know much about this stuff, but I've heard that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was all about sharing the wealth and making sure everyone's equal, right?

A) Yes
"I think I can try to answer that.

From what I've heard, a military division usually has around 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers. So, if Ashland, Oregon had a population of 21,000 people in 2018, that's actually a pretty good size for a division.

The Library of Congress is huge, it's like, in America and it's got a lot of books. The Library of Alexandria was in Egypt and it was a long time ago, so it couldn't have had as many books, right?"
A: (A) Yes
"I think it's (B) Yes. Quiet don't talk, so how she gonna teach people?"
"That's an easy one. I'd say (B) Yes. I mean, Antarctica is all ice and snow, right? I don't think you can grow watermelons in that kind of weather. Brazil's got a warmer climate, so it makes sense they'd grow more watermelons."
(B) Yes
"I think it would be hard to get toilet paper if there were no loggers. Loggers cut down trees, and trees are used to make paper, right? So if there were no loggers, we wouldn't have the trees to make the paper, and that means no toilet paper. So, my answer is (B) Yes."
"I think the answer is (B) No. Silverfish are them little bugs that live in the dark and like moist places. They don't got no wings, so they can't fly. And they're pretty small, so I don't think they could climb all the way up the Empire State Building. That's a really tall building, like, over 100 stories or somethin'. I just don't think a little bug like a silverfish could make it that high."
"I reckon (A) Yes. Armadillos got that hard shell on 'em, so if someone was to use it as a shield, it might just work.

Plus, I've seen videos of them doin' tricks and stuff, and that just don't seem right. It's like they're bein' treated like circus animals or somethin'. I reckon it's better for 'em to be in the wild where they can roam free."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I heard of some Polish poet, I think his name is Adam Mickiewicz, but I'm not sure if it's him."
"I think it's (B) Yes. Coast to Coast AM started in 1984 and it's still goin' strong. I'm not really sure when it started with the current host, but I know it's been around a long time. Rush Limbaugh's show started in 1988, so Coast to Coast AM was already goin' for a few years by then."

"I think it's (A) Yes. I remember hearin' somethin' about England bein' in charge of that area before, like, after World War I or somethin'. They had somethin' called the British Mandate for Palestine, and that's when all the trouble started, I reckon. They had to deal with both the Arabs and the Jews, and it was a right old mess. So yeah, I think England was involved, even if it was a long time ago."

"I think it's (A) No. I mean, a triples tandem bike is made for three people, but it's still just a bike, right? And them Apollo 15 guys were astronauts, they were big and they had them big suits on.

(B) No
A: (A) Yes

"I think it's (A) No. I mean, armadillos got that armor on 'em, but it's for protectin' 'em from like, predators and stuff. I don't think it's strong enough to stop a bullet. Franz Ferdinand got shot, right? I don't think no armadillo armor woulda saved him from that."

"I don't rightly know what that Abitur thing is, but I think I can try. Um, Moon Jae-in, he's that South Korean fella, right? I don't know if he got that Abitur thingy or not. I'm gonna take a guess... (B) No"
(B) No
(B) Yes

"I don't rightly know who Julio Gonzalez is, but I think I heard he was a sculptor. If that's the case, I think he liked workin' with metal and stuff. Acetylene is used for weldin' and cuttin' metal, so I reckon he might've liked it. My answer is (B) Yes."
(B) Yes
"I think I can try to answer that. Um, so the Great Depression was a really bad time, right? Lots of people lost their jobs. I don't know the exact number, but I think it was a lot. Like, millions. 

And Tiger Stadium, I think that's a big place, but I don't know how many people it can hold. I'm gonna take a guess... I think it's like, 80,000 people or something? 

So, if there were millions of people unemployed, I don't think they could all fit in Tiger Stadium. That's just too many people. 

So, my answer is... (A) No."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I mean, the Supreme Court of Canada is a building, right? And buildings are usually pretty safe from earthquakes and stuff. Plus, it's in Ottawa, and I don't think Ottawa gets a lot of earthquakes. So, I reckon it's a pretty safe job for someone with seismophobia."

And I know that nowadays, in the US, people can't be treated unfairly just 'cause of who they love. That's not right. So, I reckon his treatment back then wouldn't be fair now."
"I think the answer is (B) No. 

I mean, I don't know much about cars, but I know the Obama family has a lot of people, right? There's Barack, Michelle, and their two daughters, Malia and Sasha. And sometimes they might have other family members with them too.

"I think it's (B) Yes. I've heard that the military is pretty strict about health stuff, and multiple sclerosis is a pretty serious condition. I don't think they'd want someone with that in the military, 'specially in a place like West Point where you gotta be in top shape."

"I think the answer is (B) Yes. The Powerpuff Girls are super smart and strong, so they could probly do good at a military school. They're already fightin' crime and savin' the day in Townsville, so they might be good at the military stuff too."

"I think the answer is (A) Yes. I mean, I've heard that Starbucks is a big company with lots of places all over the world, and they probably have the same stuff everywhere, right? Like, they got coffee and tea and them fancy drinks. I don't think they'd change it up just 'cause it's in China."

From what I know, Paul the Apostle was beheaded, I think. That's a pretty violent way to go, if you ask me. And if Ahimsa is about not hurtin' nobody, then I reckon bein' beheaded would be against that. So, I'm gonna take a guess and say... (B) Yes."

And Barack Obama, he was the president of the United States, but he wasn't alive back then. He was born a lot later, like in the 1960s. So, I don't think he could have been part of the Reformation."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
A: (A) Yes
(B) Yes
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. I mean, ocelots are like little wild cats, right? They're fast. And kindergartners are just little kids, they can't run that fast. I bet the ocelot could catch 'em easy."

"I think it's (A) No. I mean, I've seen pictures of them old ships, and they're pretty small. And the Statue of Liberty, that's a big statue, right? I don't think one of them old ships could carry somethin' that big."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I heard from somewhere that Adamu, or Adam, was the first person on earth, and the Holy Land is like, a special place in the Bible, right? So maybe it's where he lived or something."

A: (A) No
A: (A) Yes
"I think I can answer that. Don King, he's that boxing guy, right? I think I heard he killed a guy in a fight or somethin' back in the day. But I don't know if it was more than one. Charles Manson, he's that crazy cult guy, and I think he had his followers kill people, but I don't think he did it all by himself. I'm pretty sure he didn't kill that many people with his own hands. So, I'm gonna say... (B) No."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I've heard of cerebral palsy, it's somethin' that can happen to babies when they're born, or even before they're born. It's like, their brain don't develop right, and it affects their muscles and stuff. So, yeah, I reckon a young Scarecrow could've gotten it, if he was a real person, that is. But, I mean, he's just a character in a story, so it's not like it really matters or nothin'."
"I think I know this one.  I'm pretty sure that one of his kids, or maybe a grandkid, was made a saint. I think it was a girl. Yeah, I'm pretty sure of it. So, my answer is (B) Yes."

"I think it's (B) Yes. I mean, Gateway is like a teleporter thingy, right? It just moves people from one place to another. But the TARDIS, it's like a whole other world in there, and it can go anywhere in time and space. That's way cooler. I reckon Gateway would be pretty jealous of all the adventures the TARDIS gets to have."
(B) No
"I think the answer is (A) No. I don't think the small intestine can break down a cotton ball. I mean, cotton balls are like, made of cotton and stuff, and I don't think our bodies can digest that. We can't eat clothes or fabric, right? So, I reckon the small intestine won't be able to break down a cotton ball."
"I think it's (A) No. I mean, I've never heard of anyone eatin' hair before, and it don't sound right. I think it could hurt ya or somethin'."

"I think a sofer would be a bad job for a vegan. I'm pretty sure a sofer is someone who writes special Jewish texts, like the Torah, and they use animal products like animal skin and ink made from animals. That wouldn't be good for someone who don't eat or use animal stuff."

"I think the answer is (A) Yes. I mean, lifeboats are for savin' people, right? They can go in the water and pick up people who are in trouble. I don't know where the Hooke Sea is, but if it's a body of water, a lifeboat should be able to rescue people from it."
A: (A) Yes
(B) No

"I think it's (A) Yes. I mean, runnin' for President of India, that's a big deal, right? You gotta travel all around, meet lots of people, and do lots of stuff. That costs a lot of money. I don't know how much it costs, but I'm sure it's way more than a new iPhone 11. That's just a phone, but bein' President is a huge job."
"I think the answer is (A) No. A Deacon is like a church person, right? They're all about God and stuff. 'God Awful Movies' sounds like it's makin' fun of God or somethin', so I don't think a Deacon would be into that."

A: (A) No
"I think it's (A) No. I don't rightly know what a quadragenarian is, but it sounds like a big word. I think it means someone in their 40s, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I don't think people in their 40s have little memory capacity. My mom's in her 40s and she remembers everything."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I mean, I've seen a lot of Harry Potter movies and they all seem to have done really well. I've also seen The Matrix, and it was good and all, but I don't think it was as big as Harry Potter. Harry Potter had like, a million movies and they all made a lot of money. The Matrix had a few movies, but not as many as Harry Potter. Plus, Harry Potter has all the books and merchandise and stuff, so I think it was a better investment for Warner Bros."
(B) No
A: (A) No
"I think the answer is (A) Yes. I mean, I've seen them surgeries on TV and they seem to take a few hours, but I've also seen them ballets and they can go on for like 3 hours or more. So yeah, I think the surgery would be done before the ballet is over."
"I think the answer is (B) No. I mean, makin' a jet plane is super complicated, right? You need lots of smart people, like engineers and scientists, and factories and machines to build it. And where would you get all the materials from? You'd need metal and fuel and all sorts of other stuff. I don't think one person could just make a jet plane on their own, without any help from others. Plus, you'd need roads and airports and all that to even test the thing. So, yeah, I think you need society to make a jet plane."
(B) Yes
"I don't rightly know who Lhamo Thondup is, but I think I heard of the Dalai Lama, and I think that's who you might be talkin' about. If that's the case, I don't think the Catholic Church would consider him a saint, 'cause he's a Buddhist, not a Catholic. So, I'd say (A) No."
"I think the answer is (B) No. Sesame seeds are tiny and brown, but they're not slimy or jelly-like like frog eggs. Wood frog eggs are usually in a cluster and look like a bunch of tiny jelly balls, so I don't think you'd mistake a sesame seed for one."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
"I think it's (B) No. Godzilla's like a big monster, right? I don't think no earthquake could kill him. He's been blown up and stuff before, and he always comes back. I don't think a big shake would be enough to get rid of him."
"I think it's (B) No. I've seen them martial arts people doin' ukemi, and it's like they're rollin' with the punches, but they're still movin' and stuff. So, I reckon the energy's still there, just bein' redirected or somethin'."
"I think I 'eard somethin' about that. I'm pretty sure it's (B) Yes. I think it's somethin' to do with Prince Andrew, Duke of York. I 'eard 'e's been accused of some pretty bad stuff, like bein' friends with a pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein, and maybe even doin' some bad things 'imself. But I don't know all the details, I just 'eard it from me mates down the pub."
"I think it's (A) Yes. I've heard that Universal Music Group's headquarters is in New York City, and the NY Stock Exchange is also in New York City. So, I guess the sound of the closing bell can be heard from there."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I've heard some folks say that The Jungle Book has some racist stuff in it, like how the monkeys are portrayed and some of the language used. I don't rightly know all the details, but I've heard it's a thing."

(B) No
"I think it's (A) Yes. James Cotton, he's a harmonica player, right? And harmonicas can be kinda loud and sharp-soundin'. Smooth jazz is all about bein' mellow and smooth, so I reckon his harmonica might stick out too much and be too loud for that kinda music."
A: (A) Yes
A: (A) Yes
"I think I know this one. Kate Gosselin, she's that lady with a lot of kids, right? I think she had 8 kids or somethin'. A Bandy team, I'm pretty sure that's a sport, and I think it's like hockey or somethin'. I don't know how many people are on a Bandy team, but I think it's like 11. So, if Kate Gosselin's got 8 kids, and her and her husband, that's 10 people. So, yeah, I think they could almost fill a Bandy team. But, I'm not really sure, I'm just guessin'."
I think it's (B) Yes. I've heard that the Great Recession was a really bad time for jobs and lots of people lost theirs.
"I think it's (B) Yes. I've heard that Jesus and some of the people at the Last Supper are prophets in Islam, like Jesus and the apostles."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I've heard that Japanese serfs, they were like, samurai or somethin', and they had more respect and power than the English serfs. They were like, warriors and stuff, and they had a code of honor, the Bushido code. English serfs, on the other hand, were just like, peasants, ya know? They didn't have all that respect and power."
"I think Andrew Johnson was the 17th president of the United States. I don't know much about Elagabalus, but I think he was an emperor of Rome. I think he was the 25th emperor or something. So, if Andrew Johnson was 17th and Elagabalus was 25th, then Andrew Johnson's number is lower. So the answer is (B) No."
"I think it's (B) Yes. I've heard that some people who done bad things, like killin' people, they liked readin' that book ""The Catcher in the Rye"". I don't rightly know why, but I think it's 'cause the main fella, Holden Caulfield, he's kinda like a rebel and some folks might relate to that. But I ain't no expert or nothin'."
(B) No
"I think it's (A) No. I don't think you can go water skiing on Venus 'cause I heard it's all hot and stuff, and there ain't no water there."

But, I think I can try to find the answer. The text says ""Patrick Wisdom, Patrick Wisdom, Patrick Wisdom and Patrick Wisdom returned as judges"", but that can't be right. I think the text is trying to trick me. I'm going to take a guess and say that the judges are probably the same as the previous seasons, and I know that Howie Mandel, Mel B, Heidi Klum, and Simon Cowell were judges in previous seasons. So, I'm going to take a guess and say that the judges are Howie Mandel, Mel B, Heidi Klum, and Simon Cowell."
