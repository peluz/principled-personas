"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The number of eggs she sells is 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18 per day.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and then subtract the total cost from it.

The original value of the house was $80,000. After repairs, the value increased by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
New value = Original value + Increase in value
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

The total cost for Josh is the cost of the house plus the cost of repairs.
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value.
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs a total of 3 * 3 = 9 sprints per week.

Since each sprint is 60 meters, the total distance he runs per week is 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to determine the total amount of feed needed for the day. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and so on, up to the 16th glass.

The first glass costs $5.
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.
The third glass costs $5.
The fourth glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.
This pattern continues, alternating between $5 and $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

8 glasses at $5 each = 8 x $5 = $40
8 glasses at $3 each = 8 x $3 = $24
Total cost = $40 + $24 = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. 

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, we need to add the 20 minutes it took for the Windows update. 

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (Windows update) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he was in standstill traffic, so he didn't move.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drove at 30 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drove at 80 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

However, we also need to consider the distance he traveled before turning around. He drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

We can see that the total revenue is still less than the total cost in the first 5 years. However, in the 6th year, the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108), but in the 7th year, the total revenue will be $73.50 ($63 + $10.50), and the total cost will be $111 ($108 + $3). However, in the 6th year, the total revenue is still less than the total cost, but the difference is decreasing. 

However, if we calculate the 7th year, the total revenue will be $73.50 and the total cost will be $111. The difference is still negative. 

However, if we calculate the 8th year, the total revenue will be $84 ($73.50 + $10.50) and the total cost will be $114 ($111 + $3). The difference is still negative.

However, if we calculate the 9th year, the total revenue will be $94.50 ($84 + $10.50) and the total cost will be $117 ($114 + $3). The difference is still negative.

However, if we calculate the 10th year, the total revenue will be $105 ($94.50 + $10.50) and the total cost will be $120 ($117 + $3). The difference is still negative.

However, if we calculate the 11th year, the total revenue will be $115.50 ($105 + $10.50) and the total cost will be $123 ($120 + $3). The difference is positive.

Therefore, it will take 11 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for each.

For the jewelry worth $5,000 with a 2.5% increase:
Increase in value = $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 with a 1.2% increase:
Increase in value = $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher increase in value, which is the jewelry. However, to find the actual profit, we need to compare the increase in value of both options. The profit is the difference between the two increases in value.

Profit = Increase in value of jewelry - Increase in value of electronic gadgets
Profit = $125 - $96
Profit = $29

However, the question asks for the profit the merchant would make by making a choice. This implies the profit is the increase in value of the chosen option. Therefore, the profit would be the increase in value of the jewelry.

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He spent $20 * 8 = $160 on video games and had $5 left.

Since he had $5 left, that means he spent $195 - $5 = $190 on video games and other possible expenses. However, we know he spent $160 on video games, so the remaining $30 must have been spent on other possible expenses or he didn't spend it.

However, the question states that he ""sells all his toys"" and then uses the money to buy video games. This implies that he sold all his toys (Lego sets) and used the money to buy video games.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. So, her running speed is twice her skipping speed, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, which is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running and 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles. The distance she travels while walking is 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles.

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, we subtract this from Polly's new throwing distance to find the distance she can stand outside the flames and still hit the dragon: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to first determine the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones had initially. 

Since she cut each of the 5 pies into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume is 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can find out how many grams are in one serving by dividing the total weight by the number of servings.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.

Now, we can multiply the grams per serving by the number of servings you can eat.

60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it takes to write each article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had left is (80 + x) - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. So, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to first determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4:
120 units * 3/4 = 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
120 units - 90 units = 30 units

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. 

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight he still needs to remove (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.

The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, she gets a 10% increase, so her new monthly salary is:
$600 + (10% of $600) = $600 + $60 = $660

Since she gets a 10% increase every year, after the first year (6th year in the company), her monthly salary will be:
$660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + $66 = $726

After the second year (7th year in the company), her monthly salary will be:
$726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

After the third year (8th year in the company), her monthly salary will be:
$798.60 + (10% of $798.60) = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Now, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 to get her annual salary:
$878.46 * 12 = $10,541.52

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:
x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs per child. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:
Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120
Total number of pets = 348

Total number of students = 200
Number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we multiply the number of girls by 2/3.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes (since 64 / 2 = 32).

Now, we know that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. So, to find out how many cans were used, we divide the total ounces of canned tomatoes (64) by the ounces per can (16). 

64 / 16 = 4

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans (4) by the number of tomatoes per can (3) to find the total number of tomatoes used.

Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, and the cars that took the exit is 30. 

Cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes = 30 - 5 = 25
Cars that drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Now, to find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks 1 glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days (since he has soda on the other day), so we add 1 more glass to the total. Therefore, he drinks 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week: 20 + 7 = 27.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

So, the total hours of TV he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, the number of episodes is 90 / 30 = 3.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed to reach the shore, we can set up a proportion since we know the time it took her to reach the shore (64 seconds) and the time it took her to row 20 feet (16 seconds).

Distance = (20 feet * 64 seconds) / 16 seconds
Distance = 80 feet

Now that we know the total distance, we can calculate the amount of water taken on. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.

"To calculate the profit Sasha makes, we need to first determine the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost price is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost price is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit Sasha makes is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. We also know that his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's call Lylah's salary four years ago 'x'. Then, Adrien's salary four years ago can be expressed as x + 30% of x, which is equal to $40,000.

x + 0.3x = 40000
1.3x = 40000
x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769 (approximately)

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.

Now, we know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. To find his new salary, we can calculate 40% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

Adrien's new salary = 40000 + 0.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 40000 + 16000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume that her salary also increased by some percentage. However, the problem doesn't specify the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. But we can infer that the percentage increase in Lylah's salary is the same as the percentage increase in Adrien's salary four years ago, which is 40% more than what he was making four years ago, but in this case, we will assume Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's salary four years later which is 40% of his salary four years ago.

Lylah's new salary = 30769 + 0.4 * 30769
Lylah's new salary = 30769 + 12307
Lylah's new salary = 43076

Now, we can find the total salary the two were receiving four years later by adding their new salaries.

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43076
Total salary = 99076

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of these costs:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To find the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to calculate the total cost of the doctors and the total revenue from the patients.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, let's convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

The cost of the doctors to the hospital is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The revenue from the patients is:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit the hospital makes is the difference between the revenue and the cost:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $40,000 - $30,000
= $10,000

"To find the number of elves left, we need to subtract the elves who quit from the total number of elves.

First, a third of the elves quit. Since there are 60 elves, a third of them is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

So, after the first group quits, there are 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Then, 10 more elves quit. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides and multiply it by the cost per ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, they rode a total of 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride cost 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate how many miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, we multiply the miles walked on Monday by 6.

Miles walked on Monday = 4 miles
Miles walked on Tuesday = 4 * 6 = 24 miles

Now, we add the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday to get the total miles walked on those two days.

Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday = 4 + 24 = 28 miles

We are given that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - Total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 28
Miles walked on Wednesday = 13

Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the equations we derived earlier, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of each pack of cloths is $5, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

We know that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon 'x'. Then, 1/3 of x is 6. So, x = 6 * 3 = 18.

Before the raccoon, there were 18 fries. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. So, before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

A seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

Therefore, Dave bought a pack of 34 french fries.

5 * 20 = 100 miles

There are 2 days in a weekend. Pancho walks 10 miles a day on weekends, so the total miles walked on weekends is:
2 * 10 = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to find the total miles walked in a week:
100 + 20 = 120 miles

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the age of each bird. 

We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Thirtytwo (8 years), Sally Four (8 years), Granny Red (16 years), and Sally Two (19 years).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the total minimum payment and then the total payment with the 50% increase.

Minimum payment:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add it to the total minimum payment.
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500
Total payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the total payment in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12.
Total yearly payment: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards. 

First, let's calculate the cost per gallon: 
Cost per gallon = $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5 per gallon.

Now, let's calculate the revenue per gallon: 
Revenue per gallon = 20 glasses * $0.50 per glass = $10 per gallon.

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon: 
Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can calculate the number of gallons they made: 
Number of gallons = Total profit / Profit per gallon = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total amount they spent on lemons: 
Total spent on lemons = Number of gallons * Cost of lemons per gallon = 5 * $3 = $15.

Total number of votes = 80
Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

Loser's votes = Total number of votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

"To find the number of red roses Sandra ordered, we first need to find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies (200) is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. Since we know the number of pink calla lilies is 200, we can set up the equation:

5x = 200

To find x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

So, the number of white carnations is 40. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x:

Number of red roses = 4 * 40
Number of red roses = 160

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From statement 2, two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years old. Since Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age two years ago, Mark's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

From statement 1, Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4x400 meter relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So, the times for each runner are:
60, 57, 54, 51 seconds

The total time taken by this team is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time taken by the faster team from the total time taken by the slower team:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each event and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

P(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll:

P(even, even) = P(even) × P(even) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25

Now, let's calculate the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row:

ΔP = P(>3) - P(even, even) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this difference as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

ΔP (%) = 0.25 × 100 = 25%

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples Jenna picked (10) to the number of apples her mom picked (20) to get the total number of apples picked.

10 (Jenna's apples) + 20 (mom's apples) = 30

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to determine the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total amount of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total amount of straw given to the rats by subtracting the amount given to the hamsters from the total amount given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since there are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can set up the equation 3x * 6 = 90, where x is the number of rats in each cage.

Solving for x, we get 3x = 90 / 6, which simplifies to 3x = 15. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 5.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The cost price per bag is $20, and the selling price per bag is $30. There's also a transportation cost of $2 per bag.

The total cost price for 'x' bags is $20x, and the total transportation cost is $2x. The total selling price for 'x' bags is $30x.

The total profit is the total selling price minus the total cost price and the total transportation cost. We know the total profit is $400.

So, we can set up the equation: 
$30x - ($20x + $2x) = $400

Combine like terms:
$30x - $22x = $400
$8x = $400

Now, divide both sides by $8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

"To find the number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the number of trees that die.

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net gain is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year. After 10 years, he has planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees and chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees. The net gain is 100 - 20 = 80 trees.

Adding the initial 50 trees, Tom now has 50 + 80 = 130 trees. However, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 130, we multiply 130 by 0.3, which is 39. So, 39 trees die.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

"To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to break it down into two parts: the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary.

The one-time monetary reward is $5000.

For the increased salary, we need to calculate the total amount of the raise. John makes $2000 a week, and he gets a 5% raise. To calculate the raise, we multiply his weekly salary by 5% (or 0.05):

$2000 x 0.05 = $100

So, John's new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Since John works every week of the year, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate his total salary for the year:

$2100 x 52 = $109,200

However, this is his salary after the raise. To find the total amount he made that year, we need to add the one-time monetary reward to his salary before the raise for the first week, and then add the rest of the year's salary after the raise. 

$2000 (first week's salary before the raise) + $5000 (one-time reward) + $109,200 - $2100 (first week's salary after the raise) = $2000 + $5000 + $109,200 - $2100 = $107,100

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, and Sara already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns per mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2 (since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens).

We also know that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first determine the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute. So, in 4 minutes, each pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of water in the small pool now:

x - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8

The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, which is the initial amount borrowed plus 10% of that amount.

Initial amount borrowed: $2000
Additional amount (10% of $2000): $2000 * 0.10 = $200
Total amount owed: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:
Monthly payment: $165
Total payments in 12 months: $165 * 12 = $1980

Since Janeth owes $2200 and will pay $1980 in 12 months, her remaining balance will be:
Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add three years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we add three years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can add these points to find the total points scored by the three of them: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's points, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54.

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40

- 40 water type

Total cards initially = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards:
- 30 fire type
- 20 grass type
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type

Total cards after losing 8 water type = 30 + 20 + 32 = 82

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- 30 fire type
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type
- 32 water type

Total cards after buying 14 grass type = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

Now, we know that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So Griffin was left with (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To find 'x', we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

Since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, and he killed 12 cougars, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals
- Total animals: 25 + 48 = 73 animals

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30. 
30% of 30 = 0.3 * 30 = 9

Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide.
30 - 9 = 21

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.
21 * 4 = 84

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

2. Since there are 20 stalls now (not 10), and Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, we divide 40 cows by 20 stalls to find the number of cows added to each stall. 40 / 20 = 2 cows per stall.

3. Now, we know that each stall initially had 20 cows, and 2 more cows were added to each stall. So, the total number of cows in each stall is 20 + 2 = 22 cows.

4. To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8. 22 * 8 = 176 cows.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing its height by 10 and multiplying by 400. 

The tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get 20 sections. Then, we multiply 20 sections by 400 pounds per section to get 8000 pounds.

However, the termites ate 30% of the tree, so we need to find 70% of the original weight. To do this, we multiply 8000 pounds by 0.7 (which is equivalent to 70%).

8000 * 0.7 = 5600

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the total stitches for the two sleeves would be:

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last:
21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold bread on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend. 

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target.

120 (target) - 65 (total crates sold) = 55 crates.

- Carmen's initial bid: $200
- Person 1 bids: $200 + $50 = $250
- Carmen bids: $250 + $50 = $300
- Person 2 bids: $300 + $50 = $350

"To find the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus given to the driver per year.

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 60 miles
Total miles driven per week = 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
Total miles driven per year = 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

Total cost per year for miles driven = 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000

Total bonus given to the driver per year = $150 per month * 12 months = $1,800

Total cost per year for driving = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them up as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)

Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can see that 16 pieces of paper are needed to print all 32 pages.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books and that the total number of books was 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that Elise sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonuses.

April has 30 days, so assuming a 5-day workweek, Watson worked 30 / 7 * 5 = 21.43 (round down to 21 days since you can't work a fraction of a day, but for the sake of this calculation, we'll use 21.43 days to get a more accurate answer, then round down to 21 days for the final answer), but since we know he works 5 days a week, we can calculate the number of weeks he worked. 30 / 7 = 4.29 weeks, round down to 4 weeks.

Watson earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are 10 * 10 = $100 per day.

Since Watson worked 21 days in April, his total earnings from his hourly wage are 21 * 100 = $2100.

Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson got a bonus for 4 weeks. So, his total bonus earnings are 4 * 300 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings in April are 2100 + 1200 = $3300.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks (8 pounds), we need to divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.

8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4 * 4 weeks = 16 weeks.

For the ice cream, the original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we are buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

We can express the total number of players as the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(4D + D + D/2) / 2 = 105
(9D/2) / 2 = 105
9D/4 = 105

Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate D:
9D = 420

Divide both sides by 9:
D = 420 / 9
D = 46.67

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number (as you can't have a fraction of a player), but in this case, we can see that the numbers don't add up to 105 if we round down. Let's try rounding up to the nearest whole number and see if that works.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since there are 100 employees in total, and 40 are junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

However, we need to note that not all 60 remaining employees are programmers. We are only given the number of junior programmers, not the total number of programmers. Let's assume the number of non-programmers is x. Then the number of senior programmers is 60 - x.

We are not given the value of x, but we can still calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month. 

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is (60 - x) * ($2000 + $400) = (60 - x) * $2400.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + (60 - x) * $2400.

However, we can simplify this by noting that the number of senior programmers must be less than or equal to 60. The maximum amount the company pays to all the programmers per month is when x = 0 (i.e., all 60 remaining employees are programmers). 

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + 60 * $2400 = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage points to be charged and then multiply it by the time it takes to charge 1 percentage point.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs to be charged to 100%. The remaining percentage points to be charged is 100% - 60% = 40%.

Since the phone charges at the rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 minutes to charge the remaining 40 percentage points.

40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

"To find out how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to calculate the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip and then apply the rewards and the coupon to this shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 they spent, they earned $1 off their next purchase. So, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards of $1 each, for a total of $4 in rewards.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 in rewards, so the price is now $43 - $4 = $39.

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

So, the final price the customer paid is $39 - $8 = $31.

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

Job A:
Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
Taxes: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
Gross income: $42,000/year
Property tax: $6,000
Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Taxes: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (also known as Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, it seems there's a discrepancy in the names, as 'RJ' and 'Richard' are likely referring to the same person. Assuming that's the case, we'll consider 'RJ' as an error and use 'Richard' with 5 guns instead.

So, the total number of guns is: 
DJ's guns: 8
Nick's guns: 10
Richard's guns: 5
Total guns: 8 + 10 + 5 = 23

Now, we'll divide the total number of guns by the number of people (4) to find out how many guns each of them would have if they shared their guns equally.

Total guns: 23
Number of people: 4
Guns per person: 23 / 4 = 5.75

Since you can't divide a gun, we'll round down to 5 guns per person, as you can't have a fraction of a gun.

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide by 3:

x = 70

Now, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to determine the weight of each animal first. 

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight of the animals: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds) to the total weight of the animals, we get:

Daily earnings = $1000/day

When the factory made silos:
Daily earnings = Number of silos sold per day * Price per silo
Daily earnings = 5 silos/day * $220/silo
Daily earnings = $1100/day

Now, we can calculate the percentage increase in daily earnings:
Percentage increase = ((New earnings - Old earnings) / Old earnings) * 100
Percentage increase = (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100
Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent on equipment to find the amount spent on functioning equipment: 
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

She has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples picked on Monday is $56 / $4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

The total number of apples picked over the three days is 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then add it to the principal amount. 

The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, it's (10%/year) * (5 months / 12 months/year) = 4.17% (approximately).

Now, let's calculate the interest: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time 
= $3,650 * 4.17% 
= $3,650 * 0.0417 
= $152.105 

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
= $3,650 + $152.105 
= $3,802.105 

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly payment = $3,802.105 / 5 
= $760.421 

Rounded to two decimal places, the monthly payment is approximately $760.42.

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, the total number of hours she spends running the stand is: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he is left with 2/5 of his original land. We know that 2/5 of his original land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find the value of each part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total parts in the ratio:

165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now that we know the value of each part, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices and also subtract the slices eaten by Jenny.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 / 3 = 4).

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 / 4 = 3).

So, Bill and Mark together have 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need:
- 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups of flour
- 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need:

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally subtract the energy used after reducing the time.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. In a day, it uses 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

In 30 days, the energy used is 7.2 kWh * 30 = 216 kWh.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. The energy used in a day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient.

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we multiply the weight of each ingredient by its cost.

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

He then did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he took before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 2,000 + 10,000 = 12,000 - 2,000 = 10,000 steps - 2,000 steps = 8,000 steps left to take, but he had already taken 6,000 steps. So, he had 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps left to take before the jog, but he took some steps during the jog.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. Given that there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute the value of 'c' into the first equation to find 'd':
124 + d = 180
d = 56

The number of dromedaries is 56."
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given:

1. Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km
2. Distance traveled in the next 2 days: 30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km
3. Distance traveled on the 7th day: 0 km (since he wasn't traveling)
4. Distance traveled in the second week: 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply the size of Peter's locker by 4 to find the size of Zack's locker.

Size of Zack's locker = 4 * Size of Peter's locker
= 4 * 5 cubic inches
= 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply the size of Zack's locker by 2 to find the size of Timothy's locker.

Size of Timothy's locker = 2 * Size of Zack's locker

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply 3/5 by the number of remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18.

2. The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month. 
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The increased rate period is the remaining time after the introductory and normal rate periods. 
   2 years is 24 months. 
   24 months - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months at $14 per month.

"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Since the jogger jeans cost $22 and he saved $2, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.

Since the tattered jeans cost $28 and he saved $4, the original price of the tattered jeans was $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Kenny started with x cards.

Since he keeps 1/3 of them, he sells 2/3 of the cards. The number of cards he sells is (2/3)x.

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is (2/3)x * $1.5 = $1x.

He uses $100 to buy the ticket and has $50 left for spending cash, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $100 + $50 = $150.

Since $1x = $150, we can solve for x:

x = $150 / $1
x = 150 / 1
x = 100

However, this is the number of cards he would have sold for $1 each. Since he sold them for $1.5 each, we need to divide 150 by 1.5 to get the actual number of cards he sold:

150 / 1.5 = 100

But this is the number of cards he sold, which is 2/3 of the total number of cards. To find the total number of cards, we need to multiply by 3/2:

(100) * (3/2) = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hot dogs. This means the caterer prepared:

- 18 guests * 2 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs
- 18 guests * 1 hot dog = 18 hot dogs

Total hot dogs prepared = 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means the total number of hot dogs needed is:

- 40 guests * 2 hot dogs = 80 hot dogs

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs, there is a shortage of:

80 hot dogs (needed) - 54 hot dogs (prepared) = 26 hot dogs

Since each guest needs 1 hot dog to get a second hot dog, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is equal to the shortage of hot dogs.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Since he spent $1.20 on chips, the amount he spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We can rearrange this formula to find the width: Width = Area / Length.

Width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike ride) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, James' swim time = 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, so James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * (30 minutes / 60 minutes)
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay it eats is:

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together.

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 4500 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the farm truck to find the number of trips needed.

Number of trips = Total weight of feed / Capacity of the farm truck
= 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds
= 2

The farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents per week from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents per week from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

1. She started in 1st place.
2. She fell back 5 spots, so she was in 1 + 5 = 6th place.
3. She moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 6 - 2 = 4th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 4 + 3 = 7th place.
5. She jumped ahead 1 spot, so she finished in 7 - 1 = 6th place.

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately and then add them together.

Number of basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards
Number of baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards
Total number of cards: 150 cards + 200 cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students can be found by dividing the total number of cards given by the number of cards per student:
300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost for each of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents. Since she received a $1 discount, we need to subtract $1 (100 cents) from the total cost. So, Becky paid 900 - 100 = 800 cents.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents. Since she received a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of 1000 cents, which is 0.1 * 1000 = 100 cents. So, Kelly paid 1000 - 100 = 900 cents.

Now, let's find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. Kelly paid 900 cents, and Becky paid 800 cents. The difference is 900 - 800 = 100 cents.

Since the question asks for the difference in dollars, we need to convert 100 cents to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 100 cents is equal to $1.

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Total shoes gained = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

Total shoes before Saturday = Initial shoes + Total shoes gained

"To find the number of pencils left, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year is:
30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find the number of pencils used, we multiply the total pencils by 1/5:
300 pencils * 1/5 = 60 pencils

Now, we subtract the pencils used from the total pencils to find the remaining pencils after two months:
300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find the number of pencils left, we multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3:
240 pencils * 1/3 = 80 pencils

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x/2) = 3

Then, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':

x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to first convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, which is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 inches. 

The two remoras are each 6 inches long, so their combined length is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents:

(Combined length of remoras / Shark's length) * 100
= (12 / 120) * 100
= 0.1 * 100

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's represent the total number of students as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes. Since he can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he has available is:
3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Now, we can divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the number of days (12) to find out how long he has to spend walking each day:
240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts. 

We can do this by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy (9) and the number of kids allergic to peanuts (6), but since we're double-counting the kids who are allergic to both, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both (3) to avoid counting them twice.

So, the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts is: 9 + 6 - 3 = 12.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300.
So, the price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.
For 3 days, the cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects found is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + (x/2 + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine the x/2 terms:

2x + x + 7 = 43

Combine the x terms:

3x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 36

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know Bodhi found 12 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found x/2 = 12/2 = 6 insects

And we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 insects

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, 5 days a week, so she takes a total of 2 * 5 = 10 bus trips per week.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

"To find the total number of animals, we need to determine the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo.

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The zoo has 20 sheep and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:

- Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 + 80 = 120

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3
Potatoes: 4 / 4 = 1

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought: 3 + 1 = 4

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose the weight and the total calorie deficit required.

First, let's calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, we need to count the days from January 1st to July 19th.

January: 31 days
February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 30 days
July: 19 days

Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

Now, let's calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds. Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required is:

Total calorie deficit = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Now, let's calculate the daily calorie deficit needed:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 200 days
= 525 calories/day

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x:

3x = 3 * 30,000

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh):
Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/h * 24 h = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/h * 24 h = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:
Weekly cost before: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly cost after: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, if one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means that one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since painting a whole house is twice as much work as painting half a house).

Next, we need to convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is equal to 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, it means that the total work required to paint a whole house is 240 hours.

If we have 5 people working together, the total work required to paint a whole house remains the same, but the time it takes to complete the work will be divided by 5. Therefore, the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We also know the cost of the computer and the printer. So, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April. Since April has 30 days, we can divide the total savings by 30 to find the average daily savings. However, Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, so we can't simply divide the total by 30.

Instead, let's divide the month into two halves: the first half (15 days) and the second half (15 days). Let's say Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half. Then, he saves 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings for the first half is 15x, and the total savings for the second half is 15(2x) = 30x.

Since the total savings for the month is $1125, we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

So Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, he saves 2x = 2(25) = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

For the first $1000, Antonella earns a 30% commission:
30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

For the amount over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, Antonella earns an additional 10% commission:
10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

To find the total amount Antonella earned, we add the commission from the first $1000 and the commission from the amount over $1000:
$300 + $150 = $450

"To find out how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs.

Bill started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is:
2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He has 70 guests and wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. So, the total number of bottles he needs is:
70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs to find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy:
140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a warm day. We are given that on a warm day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Twice that is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Two minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a warm day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a warm day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the three friends:
150 (Mark) + 130 (Susan) + 260 (Bob) = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total. 

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Now, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost: 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 pages = 70 pages

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

70 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 170 pages

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years and then find the nephew's age at that time. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Since Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew in 7 years, we can set up the equation: 
51 = 3 * nephew's age in 7 years

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we divide both sides by 3:
nephew's age in 7 years = 51 / 3
nephew's age in 7 years = 17

Now, to find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 from the nephew's age in 7 years:
nephew's current age = 17 - 7
nephew's current age = 10

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he can buy with his money.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for these 4 days, he spent 4 x $10 = $40. The number of wooden action figures he bought is $40 / $5 = 8.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will spend $10 per day on plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, for these 3 days, he will spend 3 x $10 = $30. The number of plastic action figures he will buy is $30 / $2 = 15.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

The total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Ford grows 40 roses per week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, let's subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

The total cost is:
$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheeses and condiments) = $33.00

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of crayon muffins she can make. 

First, we need to find out the total number of crayons Kate has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Since each crayon is worn down to small pieces, we assume each crayon can be broken down into 8 small pieces (as 8 small pieces are used to make one muffin). 

192 * 8 = 1536 small pieces

Now, we divide the total number of small pieces by 8 to find out the total number of muffins Kate can make.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

Difference: 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let x be the set temperature. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know that the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520

To find 4% of x, multiply x by 0.04:
x + 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils:
- Total cups: 12 (Judy) + 40 (her friend) = 52 cups
- Total dishes: 24 (Judy) + 44 (her friend) = 68 dishes

Now, we know that 1 box contains 90 single-use contacts and will last Pete 45 days. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:
2 * 90 = 180 contacts

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair of contacts is:

The total calories she burns is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many times 200 calories fit into 1600 calories.

Day 3: 16 feet (doubled from 8 feet)
Day 4: 32 feet (doubled from 16 feet)

Since the beanstalk is 32 feet tall on the 4th day, which is taller than Mark's window (20 feet), it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:
3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, we can calculate the protein he gets per day as follows:
200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the protein he gets per day by 7:
6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: 
x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:
10 = x

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
Adding the extra cost for the porcelain crown, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, that angle is 2x. The angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the largest angle, which is 3x:

3x = 3(30) = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents.

8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = 345 / 5 = 69

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs, so the total number of legs for dogs is 5 * 4 = 20.
Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats, so the total number of legs for cats is 2 * 4 = 8.
Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds, so the total number of legs for birds is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, we add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he received as gifts, the number of games he bought in each year, and then add them all together.

Initially, Steve received 5 games with the console.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the first year 12 + 5 = 17 games. The total number of games Steve has now is 5 (initial games) + 17 (games from the first year) = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the second year 24 + 5 = 29 games. The total number of games Steve has now is 22 (games from the first two years) + 29 (games from the second year) = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the third year 48 + 5 = 53 games. The total number of games Steve has now is 51 (games from the first two years) + 53 (games from the third year) = 104 games.

"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled (1200 miles) by the time it took to travel that distance (3 hours).

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together, we need to calculate the amount each of them makes in 12 hours.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2:
120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply the amount Ruiz makes in 1 hour by 12 to find out how much he makes in 12 hours:
60 * 12 = 720 pounds

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find out how much Marissa makes in 1 hour:
(3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we multiply the amount Marissa makes in 1 hour by 12 to find out how much she makes in 12 hours:
90 * 12 = 1080 pounds

To find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we add the amount Ruiz and Marissa made:
720 + 1080 = 1800

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from the original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours separately, then add them together.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
So, in 4 hours, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups.
The total earnings from the first 4 hours are 60 * $0.50 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
So, in 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups.
The total earnings from the next 2 hours are 20 * $0.60 = $12.

The total earnings from 6 hours are $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can undergo in a year and then divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the yearly rotations.

First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tire undergoes in a month. 
Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we need to find out how many times the tire rotates in 400 miles. 
Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we can find the number of rotations per mile by dividing 725 by 2, which is 362.5. 
Now, multiply the number of rotations per mile by the total miles driven in a month: 362.5 * 400 = 145,000 rotations per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, multiply the monthly rotations by 12 to get the yearly rotations: 145,000 * 12 = 1,740,000 rotations per year.

Now, divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo (10,440,000) by the yearly rotations (1,740,000) to find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced: 10,440,000 / 1,740,000 = 6.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can find the total number of pumps by multiplying the number of washings by the number of pumps per washing and then dividing by the number of washings per 2 pumps.

Total number of pumps = 120 washings * 2 pumps / 120 washings * 1 pump = 240 pumps / 120 = 2 * 120 = 240 / 2 = 120 * 2 = 240.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the shirt is $25, and the original price of the shorts is $35. The total original price is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount amount is 30% of $60, which is 0.3 x $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax. The total cost of the outfit is $42.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Joe's initial $50 to find out how much money he will have left: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. Since the initial cost was $100,000 for 5 months, the initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.

The cost per month for the remaining months is $20,000 + (50% of $20,000) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of John's research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't consume any meat.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to find the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright

Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel, so:

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
Monthly hanger rental cost: $5,000
Monthly fuel cost: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000
Total monthly cost (hanger + fuel): $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000
Total cost for a year (hanger + fuel): $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

"To find the total cooking time, we need to calculate the cooking time for each item. 

First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Next, we need to find the cooking time for beans. The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 50 + 30 = 80 minutes. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork: 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 minutes.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. 

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. The total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
4S + 2G = 70

Sheep and geese both have 1 head. The total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write the equation:
S + G = 20

We can solve the second equation for G:
G = 20 - S

Now, substitute G in the first equation:
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70
4S + 40 - 2S = 70
2S + 40 = 70
2S = 30

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 
20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1.
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.
The cost of 7 pounds of coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

Now, we need to find the difference between the desired height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

So, the combined hauling capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

To find out the hauling capacity of Gary's truck, we subtract the combined hauling capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total combined hauling capacity of all three trucks: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

"To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and females.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, including Larry. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings Larry cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females, which is 18 + 32 = 50.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of turtle = Speed of cat / 5
Speed of turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes, then subtract that from the total percentage used by the city.

The city uses 40% of the river's total water. 
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. 
To find the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes, we multiply 40% by 80%: 
40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 = 32%

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the number of quarts made per hour for each flavor and then multiply it by 48.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the number of quarts made per hour is:
100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the number of quarts made per hour is:
50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours for each flavor:
Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is the sum of the quarts made for each flavor:
2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking the blueberries is the initial cost of $20 plus the cost per pound of $1.5 times the number of pounds picked, which is 30. 

Cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is the cost per pound of $2.5 times the number of pounds, which is 30.

Cost of buying = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
Cost of buying = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying.

Amount saved = Cost of buying - Cost of picking

To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price. 

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price = original price + 10% of original price
New price = $700 + $70
New price = $770

Now, we multiply the new price by the number of computers to find the total amount of money the company paid.

Total amount = new price * number of computers
Total amount = $770 * 500
Total amount = $385,000

When Helga's arms are raised, she taps each foot 200 times per minute. Since she does this for 2 minutes, the total taps for each foot during this time is 200 * 2 = 400. Since she has 2 feet, the total taps for this time is 400 * 2 = 800.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 total minutes - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps for her right foot during this time is 300 * 3 = 900, and the total taps for her left foot during this time is 250 * 3 = 750. The total taps for this time is 900 + 750 = 1650.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 x (2/3) x 12 = 3 x 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x (3/4) x 12 = 2 x 9 = 18 slices.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as x. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90.

Total cost for the first park = $52 + $24 = $76

The cost for the second amusement park is:
2 adults * $14 = $28
2 children * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second park = $28 + $20 = $48

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. 
The original cost per tomato was $.5, so the original daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.
The new cost per tomato is $.4, so the new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is $250 - $200 = $50.
The weekly savings is $50 * 7 = $350.

"To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to first find out how many marbles each of them has.

We know that Sean has 56 marbles and Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding the number of marbles each of them has: 224 + 112 = 336.

"To find the number of groups needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students and 6 groups, we divide 54 by 6 to get 9 students per group.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we can find the total number of students required for 12 groups by multiplying the number of students per group by the number of groups: 9 students/group * 12 groups = 108 students.

However, we are not given any information about adding more students. Instead, we are asked how many more groups are needed to form. Since we already have 6 groups, and the activity requires 12 groups, we simply subtract the number of groups we have from the number of groups required: 12 groups - 6 groups = 6 groups.

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to first calculate the total annual electricity bill and then divide it by the number of roommates.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. To find the annual bill, we multiply this by 12 (the number of months in a year):

$100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

Since there are 5 people in total (Jenna and her 4 roommates), we divide the annual bill by 5:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

4. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

5. She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades these for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

6. In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons. Since a large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons for a total count. 29 large buttons is worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Adding this to the 60 small buttons she has, we get 87 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

However, the question asks for the total number of buttons, not the total value in small buttons. So we keep the large buttons as is and add the small buttons. The total number of buttons is 29 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 89 buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either in favor or against. Therefore, the total number of votes is also 33.

Since the total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

6 Pomeranian girls * 3 = 18 Pomeranians

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we have found that there are 18 Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up a proportion.

Let x be the total number of puppies. Then, two thirds of x is equal to 18.

(2/3)x = 18

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the combined fraction of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs sold are smart TVs, which is 1/4. 
One-eighth of the TVs sold are analog TVs, which is 1/8. 

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8 in this case. 
So, we convert 1/4 to 2/8 (multiply numerator and denominator by 2) and keep 1/8 as it is. 

Now, we add 2/8 and 1/8, which equals 3/8. 

This means 3/8 of the total TVs sold are either smart TVs or analog TVs. 
The rest, which is 1 - 3/8, is the fraction of OLED TVs sold. 

To find 1 - 3/8, we convert 1 to 8/8 (multiply numerator and denominator by 8) and subtract 3/8 from it. 
So, 8/8 - 3/8 equals 5/8. 

Now, we know that 5/8 of the total TVs sold are OLED TVs. 
Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying 5/8 by 40.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as follows:

Cost of the trip: $300
School's contribution: $300 / 2 = $150

Now, we know that John has $50. To find out how much he is missing, we subtract the school's contribution and John's money from the total cost of the trip:

Total cost - School's contribution - John's money = $300 - $150 - $50 = $100

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder at night, we subtract 33 from the daytime temperature of 45 degrees.

Nighttime temperature = 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees. To do this, we subtract the nighttime temperature from 32 degrees to find out how many degrees the house needs to be heated.

Degrees to be heated = 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed, we divide the degrees to be heated by the heat provided by each log.

Number of logs = 20 / 5 = 4

Now, we need to find 3/5 of the groups:
4. 3/5 of the groups = 3/5 * 10 = 6

Since each of these groups has 9 people, and each person brings back 2 seashells:
5. Total seashells = 6 groups * 9 people per group * 2 seashells per person = 6 * 9 * 2 = 108

For the additional 3 hours, Jamie is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. 150% of $20 is:
$20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour

So, her earnings for the additional 3 hours are:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees each month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20
= 200 + 60
= 260 employees

Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month is:
260 employees * $4000 per employee
= $1,040,000 per month

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:
$1,040,000 per month * 3 months

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

Since the percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of all of her stuffed animals, we can set up the following equation:

(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Half an hour per day for 14 days is 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. 
2 hours per day for 7 days is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

The total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 
So, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

The pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
The pass rate of the fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders, so it is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

The total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many square inches he can make with 144 chips. 

To do this, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total square inches by the height: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

The total amount of tea consumed is:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Adding the remaining amount of tea (10 quarts) to the total amount consumed, we get:

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea to gallons by dividing by 4:
48 / 4 = 12 gallons

- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students above and beyond the initial number, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Let's denote the amount of zest as 'x'. Then, the amount of fragrance is also 'x'. The amount of salt is 2x (twice the amount of zest), and the amount of sugar is also 2x (same as salt). The amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x (twice the amount of salt).

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10

Combine like terms:

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

1. Time spent recording videos: 
   18 videos/week * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week
   72 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 288 minutes/month

2. Time spent writing songs: 
   2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 hours/month
   8 hours/month * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/month

3. Time spent on makeup: 
   15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
   90 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 360 minutes/month

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
288 minutes/month + 480 minutes/month + 360 minutes/month = 1128 minutes/month

The final answer is: 1128"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, and costs $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, but the initial installation only includes 4 mirrors, so she needs to install 2 additional mirrors. 
She has 2 chandeliers, but the initial installation only includes 1 chandelier, so she needs to install 1 additional chandelier.
She has 20 pictures, but the initial installation only includes 10 pictures, so she needs to install 10 additional pictures.

The total number of additional items is 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The total cost is the cost of the initial installation + the cost of the additional items = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply his savings by 0.4:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30 + $12
Roy's savings = $42

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the height that each person can lift relative to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 inch = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance Mason traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first and second parts of his journey and then add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

In the first part of his journey, Mason travels at 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. 
Distance covered in the first part = 8 * 4 = 32 miles

In the second part of his journey, Mason travels at 8 miles per hour for 6 hours. 
Distance covered in the second part = 8 * 6 = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first part + Distance covered in the second part
Total distance = 32 + 48

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it would take one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time for one kangaroo:

Time for one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Time for one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that it will take a turtle twice as long to cross the highway as it would a kangaroo. 

Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours
Time for one turtle = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, we need to divide the time for one turtle by the number of turtles to find the total time:

Total time for four turtles = Time for one turtle
Total time for four turtles = 12 hours

"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine how many each of them made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we add the number of dishes made by each of them to find the total: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and subtract it from the reduced price of the laptop.

The reduced price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230 from these sources.

Since she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, we subtract the amount she got from her job and her mom from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs, we first need to find out how many cows are required to produce 25 liters of milk per day. 

Since one cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the total desired milk production (25 liters) by the milk production per cow (5 liters). 

25 liters / 5 liters per cow = 5 cows

The farmer already has 3 cows. To find out how many more cows he needs, we subtract the number of cows he already has from the total number of cows required.

5 cows (required) - 3 cows (already has) = 2 cows

5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so 1/3 of it has been used. 
1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so 1/2 of it has been used.

Given that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, we can express this as:
Mom's age = 3B - 1

Given that when you add all our ages, you get 87, we can express this as:

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first find the cost of one bottle of each.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling the rope:
The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. 
So, the total amount of money she will get from selling the rope is 20 meters * $2/meter = $40.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:
The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. Since we don't know the length of the new rope, we'll assume she buys a rope of the same length (20 meters) to make a fair comparison.
The cost of the new rope is 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30.

Now, let's calculate how much money she will have left over:
Profit from selling the rope - cost of the new rope = $40 - $30 = $10.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. So, we can set up the equation:

Melanie's current age + 10 = 18

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

Melanie's current age = 8

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number of years 'x'. We can set up the equation:

Melanie's current age + x = 3 * Melanie's current age

Substituting Melanie's current age as 8, we get:

8 + x = 3 * 8
8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

1. The 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.
2. The 6 packets of chicken each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon, so the cost per packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. The total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.
3. The 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.
4. The 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, so the cost per pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2. The total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart:
$10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, and assuming the pay is per mowing, she must have mowed Joe's lawn once. Therefore, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

Now, let's calculate her total earnings from mowing lawns. She mowed Joe's lawn once for $6, Kamala's lawn 3 times (3 * $6 = $18), and Alba's lawn 5 times (5 * $6 = $30). 

Total earnings from mowing lawns = $6 + $18 + $30 = $54.

Since Tasha made a total of $80, her earnings from lemonade sales would be the difference between her total earnings and her earnings from mowing lawns.

"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat in a day, then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by that number.

Abby can eat 2 slices a day. Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices they can eat in a day is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they can eat in a day: 24 / 6 = 4.

"To find the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells.

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and will turn 10 years old. The difference between 10 and 5 is 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months:
5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

However, we also need to include the months from the year she turned 5 and the year she will turn 10. So, we add the months from those years:
- The year she turned 5, she collected shells for the remaining months (7 months, assuming her birthday is in the first 5 months of the year, but to be safe we will use 12 - 5 = 7 months).
- The year she will turn 10, she will collect shells for the months before her birthday (let's assume her birthday is in the first 5 months of the year, so she will collect 5 months).

Total months = 60 months + 7 months + 5 months = 72 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the total number of months:
Total shells = 72 months * 1 shell/month = 72 shells

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of mint tea. 

Lana has 27 cups in total and uses 15 cups to brew cinnamon tea. So, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Since the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is equal, we divide the remaining cups by 2. 
12 / 2 = 6 cups of mint tea.

Now, we divide the total number of cups of mint tea by the number of rows to find the number of cups of mint tea in each row.
6 / 3 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

Since each trip takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. To find the least number of berries per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water

Now, we need to calculate the amount of water emptied from the tank in 6 days at a rate of 500 gallons per day:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

To find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount:

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left. 

He started with $150. 
He spent $10 * 5 = $50 on Friday/Saturday movies.
He spent $7 * 8 = $56 on other day movies.
He spent $8 * 2 = $16 on popcorn.
He spent $2 * 4 = $8 on candy.

Total spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

He has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since it's a Friday, the ticket will cost $10. He also wants to get a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2), which will cost $10 in total. 

So, he will spend $10 (movie ticket) + $10 (popcorn and candy) = $20.

He will have just enough money to see 1 more movie."
"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so:
600 * 1/3 = 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll

Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are:
200 * 200 = 40,000 calories

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so:
450 * 1/3 = 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin

Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are:
300 * 150 = 45,000 calories

The total calories from all the pastries are:
40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 * 2 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.
Number of days = 5.

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the distance traveled by the bus and the car:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so we can write the equation:
P + L + J = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write the equation:
L = J + 10

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can write the equation:
P = L + J

Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Substituting the expression for P into the first equation, we get:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Now that we know Paul's and John's ages, we can find Peter's age:
P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

Maria's friends had 4 * 2 = 8 balloons initially.
Maria had 1 balloon initially.
So, the total initial number of balloons was 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so the total additional balloons are 5 * 3 = 15.

The total number of balloons is 9 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 24.

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Fern will make from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

The total amount of money from the Widgeteer 3000 is 43200 * 6 = $259200.
The total amount of money from the WidgetMaster 9000 is 32400 * 6 = $194400.

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) would cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds per sheep

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

15 goats * 5 pounds per goat = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds per sheep = 84 pounds

Total amount of hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, he has:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of a pen:

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that B + A + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation B + A + D = 45 with A + 20. This gives us A + 20 + A + D = 45.

We also know that B = D + 10, so A + 20 = D + 10. This means D = A + 10.

Now, we can substitute D in the equation A + 20 + A + D = 45 with A + 10. This gives us A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can set up the equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to first determine the total number of episodes. 

Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can calculate the number of episodes as follows:

Number of episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Number of episodes = 20 / 2
Number of episodes = 10

Now, we can find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total minutes = Number of episodes * Length of each episode
Total minutes = 10 * 20
Total minutes = 200

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance = Speed * Time

1. Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first part of the journey:
Distance1 = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

2. Distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance2 = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

3. Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the second part of the journey:
Distance3 = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance3 - Distance2
Total Distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Total Distance = 374 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made, the ones from her office, and the ones from her friends. 

Greta made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies. 
Her office gave her 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies. 

To find the number of brownies left, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies. 

Brownies left = 66 - 18 = 48

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. To calculate her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75%, and 75% can be represented as 0.75). So, her age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add the ages of all three family members: Nani's age (8 years) + his brother's age (16 years) + his sister's age (6 years) = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to find the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players in Zeke's team + Number of players in Carlton's team

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the sum of all sides of the rectangle. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats = Perimeter * 2
Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine the total number of oranges she had and then subtract the number of oranges she gave away and kept.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she had is:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of:
2 boxes * 2 people = 4 boxes
4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, subtract the oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges:
240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges:
1/4 * 160 oranges = 40 oranges

Now, subtract the oranges she kept from the remaining oranges to find out how many she sold:
160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half the number of states in the USA = 50 / 2 = 25
Number of states in India = 25 + 4 = 29

Now, we can find the total number of states in both countries together by adding the number of states in the USA and India:

Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then subtract the amount he has already saved. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5). 

$25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to determine how many cherries Richard and Jerry have.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, Richard must have 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. 

So, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: 30 - 10 = 20.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days, and then multiply those numbers by their respective costs.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days:

Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:

Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390

Total earnings: $150 + $390 = $540

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her vacation.

She reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day. So, she will use 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Price of the blue car = $100
Discount on the red car = 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40
Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Discount on the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Total cost of both cars = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car = $100 + $60 = $160

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil is currently 19 years old, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old (because 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24).

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Since Emil is currently 19 years old, his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old (because 5 years will pass before Emil turns 24).

Now, let's calculate the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother:

Dad's current age: 43
Brother's current age: 7
Sum of their ages: 43 + 7 = 50

Her mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person: 
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players.
30 - 6 = 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between plants (30 inches) to find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 27 * 6 = $162 at the store.

Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 apiece, so the cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.
Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the used soil from the total amount of soil to find out how much is left for the roses.

30 pounds (total) - 27 pounds (used) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant:

3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to cook 90 shrimp. She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 times 10 minutes = 30 minutes

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on low is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on high is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

44 = x/2

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:

88 = x

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany combined is 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

Since the flights to France and Germany are equal, the number of flights to France is half of 22, which is 11 flights.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of the three wolves' howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

The average age is (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write the equation:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the first equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

After Walter's friend gives him $200, the total amount becomes $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to find the total amount donated by everyone else, which is $2200.

The lawyer's contribution will be three times this amount: 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by 15. 

Number of people in the church next door = 750 / 15 = 50.

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 6 (2 for the adults and 4 for the kids). However, since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can consider the adult slices as 2 units each and the kid slices as 1 unit each.

So, the total number of units is 2 (for the adults) * 2 (units per adult slice) + 4 (for the kids) * 1 (unit per kid slice) = 4 + 4 = 8 units.

Each adult gets 2 units, so the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2 units / 8 units) * 100% = 25%.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, then subtract that from the total time he spends at the clinic.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born per female porcupine in a year is:

4 * 12 = 48

The total number of babies born in a year is the number of female porcupines multiplied by the number of babies born per female porcupine:

30 * 48 = 1440

The total number of porcupines after a year is the initial population plus the number of babies born:

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the gallons of water needed:
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, to find the cost of filling the pool, we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon:

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we need to calculate the total gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 9000 = 9000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park as 'x'. 

The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
x - (9% of x) * 5 = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

Then, the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
(0.55x) - (7% of x) * 3 = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:
0.34x = 28

To find the initial charge 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.34:
x = 28 / 0.34
x = 82.35

Since the charge cannot be more than 100%, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly income and the amount she needs to save.

Janet's total hourly income is $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour.
She works 40 hours a week, so her total weekly income is $25 * 40 = $1000 per week.

The down payment is 20% of the $10,000 car, which is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of fruits purchased = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar had $10 initially, so the amount left is $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation to get 4S = 4(2L) = 8L.

The total earnings from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12L + 8L = 120. Combining like terms, we get 20L = 120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we get L = 6. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this value to get S = 2(6) = 12.

There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

"To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team in a day. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day, we can convert this to hours by multiplying by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

3/8 * 24 = 9 hours per day

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days:

3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, we can calculate the total hours worked by the team:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we can divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter:

189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation: 
(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

Initial price of the car in 2007 = $20,000

Depreciation in 2008 = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price of the car in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Depreciation in 2009 = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price of the car in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Depreciation in 2010 = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,621.22
Price of the car in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,621.22 = $9,860.78

The final answer is: $9861"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of books written in English and German. 

Half of the books are written in English, so that's 50 * 0.5 = 25 books in English. 
10% of the books are written in German, so that's 50 * 0.1 = 5 books in German.

Now, we add the number of English and German books: 25 + 5 = 30 books.

Since there are 50 books in total, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice will still need to drive, we need to first calculate the total distance she has driven so far. 

Distance driven per day = 325 kilometers
Number of days = 4
Total distance driven = Distance driven per day * Number of days
Total distance driven = 325 * 4
Total distance driven = 1300 kilometers

Now, we subtract the total distance driven from the total distance to New York City to find out how many kilometers Bernice will still need to drive.

Total distance to New York City = 1955 kilometers
Distance left to drive = Total distance to New York City - Total distance driven
Distance left to drive = 1955 - 1300
Distance left to drive = 655 kilometers

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, let's break down the information step by step.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became:
120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, leaving:
140 - 50 = 90

Then, twice the number of people who descended boarded the train, which is 2 * 50 = 100. So, the total number of people became:

"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top cost $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt).

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of each tile
Total number of tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles = 200

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost.

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Since the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads for the twin beds (4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads). For the king size bed, he will need to do 1 load.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads per week * 52 weeks per year = 156 loads per year.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats eat per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that number.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, so the total amount of food per cat per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food they eat per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the total amount of food they eat per day (360 grams):

720 / 360 = 2

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to determine how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

We know Becky ate 10 slices and that she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, we can add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 (Becky) + 7 (Jake) + 14 (Silvia) = 31 slices.

The total number of slices in 4 pizzas is 4 * 8 = 32 slices. However, the question asks for the total number of slices they ate, not the total number of slices available.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x' minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18' minutes.

We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. So, the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts is equal to 98 minutes.

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Since x represents Donovan's part, Betsy's part is x + 18, which is 40 + 18 = 58.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The number of bales left in the field is the difference between the number of bales made and the number of bales picked up: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

1. Total minutes in class per day: 
   8 periods (6 normal + 2 extra) * 40 minutes per period = 320 minutes per day

2. Total minutes in class per week: 
   320 minutes per day * 5 days per week = 1600 minutes per week

3. Extra learning time per week: 
   1/16 of weekly minutes = (1/16) * 7 * 24 * 60 minutes = (1/16) * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes per week

4. Total minutes spent learning per week: 
   1600 minutes (in class) + 630 minutes (extra learning) = 2230 minutes per week

5. Convert total minutes to hours: 
   2230 minutes / 60 = 37.17 hours per week

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5

"To find the initial weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last piece of information given.

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the triceratops initially had 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms of meat.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of 12 gallons of paint is 12 * $12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas (2 shaken and 6 unshaken).

Now, the probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas.

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of remaining sodas
= 2 / 8
= 0.25

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100:

0.25 * 100 = 25%

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the second train and then calculate the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours.

The speed of the second train is half the speed of the first train, which is 60 miles per hour. Therefore, the speed of the second train is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add their speeds to find their relative speed. The relative speed is 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours by multiplying their relative speed by the time:

Distance = Relative Speed x Time
Distance = 90 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he takes off is 20% of 50, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

The number of days Billy works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people Billy helps is 6 people per day * 40 days = 240 people.

Time for the second biggest slide = Length / Speed
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks per day, we need to add the time for his lunch and breaks. 

Bobby's lunch is 30 minutes, and he takes 2 15-minute breaks, so the total time for breaks is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 

Now, we add the time for his lunch and breaks: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunches and breaks. 

To find the total time after 5 days, we multiply the time per day by 5: 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we need to first determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and making new purchases.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise. After returning an item worth $15.00, her balance became:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
So, the price of the frying pan after the discount is:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we calculate:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
So, the price of the towels after the discount is:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to Sheila's balance:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how many years it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Now, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

To determine how many years Lauren needs to work to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the total retirement savings goal by her annual savings:

Number of years needed to work = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

However, this calculation assumes that Lauren starts saving from scratch. Since the problem doesn't specify how long Lauren has already been working and saving, we'll assume she's just starting to save. Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is 40 years.

The final answer is: 40"

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the whole based on the percentage given for the boys. Since 40% represents 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% * Total = 240

To find the total, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4 * Total = 240

Now, divide both sides by 0.4 to find the total:

Total = 240 / 0.4
Total = 600

Since the total number of students is 600 and 240 are boys, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total - Number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240
Number of girls = 360

"To determine how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we first need to calculate the total miles she can hike in a month at her current rate, and then compare it to her goal.

There are 30 days in June. If Soledad hikes twice a day, that's 2 hikes per day. At 125 miles per hike, she hikes 2 * 125 = 250 miles per day.

In a month, at this rate, she would hike 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

However, her goal is 9,300 miles. To find the difference, we subtract the miles she can hike from her goal: 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles.

Since she has 30 days to complete her goal, we divide the difference by the number of days to find the additional miles per day: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles per day.

However, since she hikes twice a day, we need to divide the additional miles per day by 2 to find the additional miles per hike: 60 miles / 2 = 30 miles per hike.

The total amount given to Peter and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples, and they gave 7 kg to Peter and Paul, they will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

However, the question asks about James, but there is no James in the initial statement. It seems there might be a mistake in the question, and it should be Jacques instead of James.

Assuming the question is about Jacques, and considering that Pierre, Paul, and Jacques will have 5 kg left, we can't determine the exact amount Jacques will have left without knowing how they will divide the remaining apples among themselves.

However, if we assume they will divide the remaining apples equally, Jacques will have 5 / 3 = 1.67 kg.

Since the question seems to be about Jacques, not James, and we can't determine the exact amount without more information, I will provide the answer based on the assumption that they will divide the remaining apples equally.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted individually. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then Camden painted 'x + 12' eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together the four of them painted 56 eggs. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together. 

So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs together. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply that by the price per plank.

First, we find out how much of the tree can be used to make logs: 80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet.

Then, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs: 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks: 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes: 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 's'. Since the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, the speed on the sidewalk is '2s'.

The distance on the beach is 2 miles, and the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours, since speed is usually measured in miles per hour. 40 minutes is 40/60 = 2/3 hours.

Now, we can find the speed on the beach: 
2 miles / (2/3 hours) = 2 / (2/3) = 2 * (3/2) = 3 miles per hour.

Now that we know the speed on the beach, we can find the speed on the sidewalk: 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and the speed is 6 miles per hour. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
time = 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hours.

Now, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes: 1/6 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 10 minutes.

The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far and how much more she needs to save.

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Since Jane wants to save a total of $60, she still needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save $28, we can divide the amount she needs to save by the amount she saves per week:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water into the water bottle, the total amount of water is 5 ounces.

The total heat energy of the mixture is the sum of the heat energy of the two types of water. Since heat energy is directly proportional to temperature, we can set up a weighted average equation:

(4 oz * 33°F) + (1 oz * x°F) = 5 oz * 40°F (minimum temperature)

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the temperature of the second mug is at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, in three weeks, they will bring:
20 cows/day * 7 days/week = 140 cows/week
140 cows/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows

So, the total number of cows after three weeks will be:
50 (initial cows) + 420 (additional cows) = 470 cows

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In three weeks, they will bring:
10 chickens/day * 7 days/week = 70 chickens/week
70 chickens/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens

So, the total number of chickens after three weeks will be:
20 (initial chickens) + 210 (additional chickens) = 230 chickens

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm:
470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount.

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

So, the total cost of 4 packs of bagels after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, to find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 
Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
It takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

Now, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. 
Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
So, Gomer ate 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days is:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - 51 = 9.

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14.

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84. We can set up a proportion to find the number of women on the bus:

9/14 = x/84

Cross-multiplying:
9 * 84 = 14x
756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14
x = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus initially.

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women who remained on the bus is:

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
$26 / $2 = 13

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:
13 * 3 = 39

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
$56 / $8 = 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
7 * 12 = 84

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold is:
84 * 3 = 252

Now, we add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:
39 + 252 = 291

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since he buys 20 rocks and sells them for $7 each, the total potential revenue is:

20 rocks * $7 = $140

However, he only sells 60% of his inventory. To find the number of rocks he sells, we multiply the total number of rocks by 0.6:

20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks is:

12 rocks * $7 = $84

Now, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost to find the loss:

Total cost = $100 (initial investment)
Total revenue = $84
Loss = Total cost - Total revenue = $100 - $84 = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days it will take her to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to find the most efficient way to complete the project. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes to complete each type of scene.

The LCM of 9, 6, and 7 is 126. However, this is not the correct answer, as it would mean Lauren is working on all three types of scenes simultaneously, which is not possible.

A more efficient way to solve this problem is to calculate the total number of days it would take Lauren to complete each type of scene separately and then add them together, but this would not be the minimum number of days.

A better approach is to try to combine the days. 

9 days for large scenes, 6 days for medium scenes, and 7 days for small scenes. If Lauren works on large scenes for 7 days and medium scenes for 6 days, she will have completed 35 large scenes and 36 medium scenes. Then she can work on large scenes for 2 more days to complete the remaining 10 large scenes, and work on small scenes for 7 days to complete the 49 small scenes.

So, the total number of days is 7 + 2 + 7 = 16 days, but she can do the last 2 days of large scenes and 7 days of small scenes at the same time as the first 7 days of large scenes and 6 days of medium scenes, so the total number of days is 7 + 6 + 7 = 20 days, but she can do the last 7 days of small scenes at the same time as the first 7 days of large scenes and 6 days of medium scenes, so the total number of days is 7 + 6 = 13 days, but she still has 2 days of large scenes left, so the total number of days is 13 + 2 = 15 days, but she can do the last 2 days of large scenes at the same time

"To find the answer, let's break down the steps:

1. Patricia initially had 30 roses.
2. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so she was left with 30 - 24 = 6 roses.
3. Then, she bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance traveled / Total time taken
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first find the probability of the second ticket winning. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:

Probability of first ticket winning: 20% = 0.2
Probability of second ticket winning: 60% = 0.6

Probability of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first find out how many seashells they collected in total.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells they collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends separately, then add them together.

There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). Mason eats 4 carrots each on these days, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
5 days * 4 carrots/day = 20 carrots

There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). Mason eats 5 carrots each on these days, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is:
2 days * 5 carrots/day = 10 carrots

Now, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs: 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.

"To find the profit Linus earned, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, for a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices. The cost of each device is $20, so the total cost is 6 * $20 = $120.

He sells each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40 per device. The total selling price is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

Isabel is 7 feet tall. 
Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.

"To determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are required to meet 100% of one person's daily energy needs. 

Since one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy needs, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to cover 100% of 2300 people's daily energy needs, we need 5 bottles * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then the number of babies wearing bows.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies wear purple.
1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies wear blue.

All blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
There are 2 babies wearing purple bows out of 4 babies wearing bows. 
The probability is 2/4 = 0.5 or 50%.

He sold half of the land (80 / 2 = 40 square meters) for $50.

Then, he sold 1/4 of his original land (80 / 4 = 20 square meters) for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters at $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

"To find the total number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 60% of the combined total of the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the combined total is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
Since the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree. Since it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the number of fruits produced each year:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B and B = Y - 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get:

4B + B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R:

So, the amount of money Rissa gave to her sister is 1/5 * $15 = $3.

Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister.

Ronnie initially had $5, so the amount of money left with Ronnie is $5 - $3 = $2.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we can find out how many pods you get per dollar by dividing the number of pods by the cost. 
120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles per dollar."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he withdraws is $1000 / $20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

4. Since each bill is $20, he has 20 * $20 = $400 left.

5. Thomas then triples his money, so he now has $400 * 3 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide $1200 by $5.

$1200 / $5 = 240

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find 20% of the original 5 inches, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used each day (1 inch), but we also need to consider that the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. 

2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days. However, since the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to subtract the amount that will be left after 2 days (1 inch) from the total remaining chalk (2.75 inches) and see if it is less than 2 inches. 

2.75 - 2 * 1 = 0.75 inches, which is less than 2 inches but the teacher can still use it for one more day since he will be left with 0.75 - 1 = -0.25 inches which is less than 0 but he can't use it, so he can use it for 2 more days and then he will have to recycle it on the next day.

So the teacher has 2 days + 1 (Monday) = 3 days before he has to recycle this piece.

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs per 60 minutes. We can convert this to a rate of snowballs per minute by dividing 20 by 60:

20 snowballs/hour / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 snowballs per minute

Now, let's consider the rate at which the snowballs melt. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so we can convert this to a rate of snowballs per minute by dividing 2 by 15:

2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute

Since the snowballs are melting, we need to subtract the melting rate from the building rate to get the net rate at which Jay is accumulating snowballs:

Net rate = Building rate - Melting rate
= 1/3 - 2/15
= (5 - 2) / 15
= 3/15
= 1/5 snowballs per minute

Now, we can use the net rate to determine how long it will take Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs. We can set up a proportion to relate the number of snowballs to the time:

Number of snowballs / Net rate = Time
60 snowballs / (1/5 snowballs per minute) = Time
60 / (1/5) = Time
60 * 5 = Time
300 minutes = Time

However, we need to convert this to hours to make sense of it. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Let's denote the number of bandages they had at the start of the third day as x. Then, at the end of the third day, they had x + 100 - 25 = x + 75 bandages.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 75 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 75 = 3.

Now, we know that at the start of the third day, they had 3 bandages. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. 

Let's denote the number of bandages they had at the start of the second day as y. Then, at the end of the second day, they had y - 28 bandages.

We know that at the start of the third day, they had 3 bandages. So, we can set up the equation y - 28 = 3.

Solving for y, we get y = 3 + 28 = 31.

Let's denote the number of bandages they had at the start of the first day as z. Then, at the end of the first day, they had z - 38 + 50 = z + 12 bandages.

We know that at the start of the second day, they had 31 bandages. So, we can set up the equation z + 12 = 31.

Solving for z, we get z = 31 - 12 = 19.

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of scotch and then the cost of one bottle of cognac.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600, so the cost of one bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since the bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of remaining fish after subtracting the fish with red stripes. 

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Now, we need to calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish to find the number of fish with blue stripes.

Number of fish with blue stripes = 5/11 * 44
Number of fish with blue stripes = 5 * 4
Number of fish with blue stripes = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to find the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, so its volume is:

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans take up about 80% of the volume due to packing efficiency, the actual volume occupied by the jelly beans is:

Actual volume = 540 * 0.8
Actual volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans in the jar by dividing the actual volume by the volume of a single jelly bean:

Total jelly beans = Actual volume / Volume of a jelly bean
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15
Total jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

Estimated red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Estimated red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3
Estimated red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans, we subtract the estimated number from the true number:

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, we multiply the total hours by his average speed: 72 hours * 50 km/hr = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we divide the distance he has traveled by the total distance and multiply by 100:

(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to first determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, so it's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 
So, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time spent cleaning classrooms and the total time available for work.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms: 
80 classrooms * 15 minutes per classroom = 1200 minutes
1200 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 20 hours

Total time available for work: 
5 days * 8 hours per day = 40 hours

Time spent cleaning classrooms per day: 
20 hours / 5 days = 4 hours per day

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms:
(4 hours / 8 hours) * 100% ≈ 50%

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we first need to find out how many books one bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold: 110 / 55 = 2.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue from selling them.

Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The cost of the eggs is 5 dozens x $2.40 per dozen = $12.

She will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so she will sell 60 eggs for 60 / 3 = 20 units. The total revenue from selling the eggs is 20 units x $1 per unit = $20.

Rose's profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original cost of the bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Total cost after discount: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the total cost to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we multiply the total cost by 100.

$15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks in the bag to find the cost per stick.

Cost per stick = Total cost in cents / Number of sticks
Cost per stick = 1500 cents / 30
Cost per stick = 50 cents

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this as:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes is 116:

s + b = 116

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know 's', we can find 'b' by substituting 's' into the first equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The number of blueberry cubes is 96."

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate each type separately.

There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, so there are 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, which is 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights. In total, there are 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

For the candles, half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 candles. In total, there are 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles: 20 + 36 = 56.

"To find the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

Since the sixth side is already solved once the fifth side is done, we don't need to add any extra time.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water

Each pack costs $2, so John needs to spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs.

"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract her total expenses.

Frances sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

Her total earnings are the sum of her earnings from cupcakes and cookies:
$40 + $40 = $80

Frances buys five trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are:
5 trays * $4/tray = $20

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:
$80 - $20 = $60

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children in the existing group is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

Finally, the original 5 children leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Now, let's add up the ages of all the siblings:
- The 3 sisters are 16 years old each, so their total age is 3 * 16 = 48 years.
- The younger brother is 12 years old.
- The older brother is 24 years old.

Total age = 48 (sisters) + 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 84 years.

"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 * 7 = 210 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation is 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on yoga is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60: 2040 / 60 = 34 hours.

This means that Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt ($8) and 50% off for the second T-shirt. The discount on the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4, so the price of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, but they are 40% off. The discount is $40 * 0.4 = $16, so the price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

2. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

3. The total number of items Igor gathered is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes. Let's denote the number of beakers as B. The total number of items is 8 (test tubes) + B (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 8 + B + 16.

4. We know that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

5. Now, let's solve for B. Combine the constants: 8 + 16 = 24. The equation becomes 24 + B = 29.

6. Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: B = 29 - 24 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, but we don't know the exact distance Aaron ran. However, we do know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run half the distance Vanessa did, which is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles. So, his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since A = 2V, we can substitute the value of A: 1/8 = 2V. To find V, we divide both sides by 2: V = 1/16 miles per minute.

Now, we know Vanessa's speed (1/16 miles per minute) and the distance she ran (4 miles). To find the time it took her to complete her part, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. Plugging in the values, we get: time = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. So, we can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by dividing the second equation by 2 to simplify it:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:
