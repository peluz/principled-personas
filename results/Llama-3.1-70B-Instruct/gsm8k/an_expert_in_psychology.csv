"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The number of eggs she sells is 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18 per day.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and then subtract the total cost from it.

The original value of the house was $80,000. After repairs, the value increased by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
New value = Original value + Increase in value
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

The total cost for Josh is the cost of the house plus the cost of repairs.
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value.
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, so the total number of sprints per week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints.

Since each sprint is 60 meters, the total distance he runs in a week is 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5.
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can assume that the odd-numbered glasses cost $5 and the even-numbered glasses cost $3.

There are 8 odd-numbered glasses (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) and 8 even-numbered glasses (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16).

The total cost of the odd-numbered glasses is 8 * $5 = $40.
The total cost of the even-numbered glasses is 8 * $3 = $24.

The total cost of all 16 glasses is $40 + $24 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. 

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, we need to add the 20 minutes it took for the Windows update. 

The total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (update) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he didn't move due to traffic, so the distance traveled is 0 miles.

In the next 0.5 hours, he drove at 30 mph. The distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours, he drove at 80 mph. The distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

The total distance traveled in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles

However, John initially drove 3 hours at 60 mph before turning around. The distance he traveled in those 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance traveled in the 4 hours after turning around from the initial distance:
Distance from home = Initial Distance - Distance traveled in 4 hours = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours worked into regular hours and overtime hours.

Regular hours: 40 hours
Overtime hours: 45 - 40 = 5 hours

Regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime pay: 5 hours * (1.2 * $10/hour) = 5 * $12 = $60

Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The total revenue from selling lemons each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Since the annual revenue is $10.50 and the annual cost is $3, the net annual revenue is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

To break even, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of $90. To find out how many years it will take, we can divide the initial cost by the net annual revenue:

$90 / $7.50 = 12 years

However, this is the time it takes to break even. To start earning money, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost and the cost of the 12th year. So, he will start earning money in the 13th year.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She sold 2 more to the red house. 
Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. 
She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. 
Now, she has (x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left. 
We are given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. 

(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5 
(x - x/3 - 2) * 2/2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5 
(x - x/3 - 2) * 2/2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

$5,000 * 0.025 = $125

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 with a 1.2% increase:
$8,000 * 0.012 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher increase in value. However, to determine the actual profit, we need to consider the initial cost. In this case, the profit is the increase in value.

The profit from the jewelry is $125, and the profit from the electronic gadgets is $96. The higher profit is $125.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert it to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the entire 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

The time Marissa has left to complete the remaining 6 miles is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x

The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 
25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. 
20 more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have the guesses of all three friends: 80, 60, and 100.

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend the money from all 13 lego sets. The amount he didn't spend is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is worth $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel running is 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
The distance she can travel walking is 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Total cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number she had initially and the number she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. 
She bought x more Post-it notes.
She used 220 Post-it notes.

The total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package is 80 + x.
The total number of Post-it notes she had after using 220 is 80 + x - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. 
So, 80 + x - 220 = 23.

Now, let's solve for x:
80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to first determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. 

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight he still needs to remove (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.

The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. Since the tank was not empty when she started (it was 12 - 4 = 8 gallons full), we can assume that she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. However, to get the actual miles per gallon, we should consider the total amount of gas used for the 100 miles, which is the difference between the full tank and the amount of gas left when she filled up. 

Since the tank holds 12 gallons and she needed 4 gallons to fill it up, she had 12 - 4 = 8 gallons left when she started the 100 miles. However, we know she used some gas to travel the 100 miles, and that amount is 4 gallons. So, the total amount of gas used for the 100 miles is 12 - 8 = 4 gallons. 

Now, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:
mpg = total miles / total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas:
Total miles per tank = miles per gallon * total gallons in the tank
Total miles per tank = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons
Total miles per tank = 300 miles

"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, she expects 3/4 of the invited guests to attend. 

3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12.

Since she needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, she will need 0.75 * 12 = 9 gift bags.

The cost of the gift bags will be 9 * $2 = $18.

"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each. There are 20 adults, so the total amount for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. There are 5 children, so the total amount for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find Jackson's age, we need to determine the ages of the other children first. 

Since James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

Jackson is 4 years old."

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to find the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

Given that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes is:
30 - 5 - 20 = 5

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit is not included in the 5. The 5 is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of potted plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants initially. 

She received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks 1 glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days (since he has soda on the other day), so we add 1 more glass, making it 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 0.5 hours (30 minutes), for a total of 1.5 hours. 
On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total hours watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, we subtract the hours watched on other days from the total hours: 
7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we divide the total hours watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed, we need to find the total time it took her to reach the shore, which is 64 seconds. 

We can find the total distance by setting up a proportion: 
16 seconds / 20 feet = 64 seconds / x feet
Cross-multiplying, we get:
16x = 64 * 20
16x = 1280
x = 1280 / 16
x = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can calculate the amount of water the boat took on. The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find the total amount of water, we divide the total distance by 10 and multiply by 2:
80 feet / 10 feet = 8
8 * 2 liters = 16 liters

"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to first find the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. 

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:

1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity

Now, divide both sides by 6 to find Brittany's phone capacity:
Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

It is given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks as 'x'. Then we can set up the equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * x

"To calculate the profit Sasha makes, we need to first determine the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost price is 10 * $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost price is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit Sasha makes is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, we multiply the miles he walked on Monday (4 miles) by 6. 
4 * 6 = 24 miles

Now, we add the miles he walked on Monday (4 miles) and Tuesday (24 miles) to get the total miles he walked on those two days.
4 + 24 = 28 miles

We know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday (28 miles) from the total mileage (41 miles).
41 - 28 = 13 miles

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian had before he lost 5. 

Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5. So, he had 20 + 5 = 25 video games before losing 5.

Now, we know Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. Since Brian originally had 25 video games, we multiply 25 by 3 to get 3 times as many video games as Brian. 

3 * 25 = 75

Bobby has 5 fewer than 75, so we subtract 5 from 75.

75 - 5 = 70

"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

The cost of the subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of the chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of the cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
The total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting the equations we derived earlier, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

We know that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon 'x'. Then, 1/3 of x is 6. So, x = 6 * 3 = 18.

Before the raccoon, there were 18 fries. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. So before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

A seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

Therefore, Dave bought a pack of 34 french fries.

Time to peel a potato: 1 minute 30 seconds = 90 seconds
Time to cut a potato: 5 seconds

Total time to peel and cut a potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the total time to peel and cut one potato by 60.

Total time to peel and cut 60 potatoes: 95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60.

Total time in minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards. 

First, let's find out the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Now, let's find out the revenue per gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is $0.50 * 20 = $10.

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can divide this by the profit per gallon to find out how many gallons they made: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Finally, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon to find out the total amount spent on lemons: 5 * $3 = $15.

Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Number of red roses = 4 * number of white carnations

Since that was two years ago, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

From statement 1, Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4x400 meter relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the following times for each member:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by this team is:

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to consider the numbers 4, 5, and 6 on a six-sided die. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the even numbers 2, 4, and 6 on a six-sided die. There are 3 favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes for the first roll, and the same for the second roll. 

Probability of rolling an even number = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each with 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. This will give us the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats: 140 - 50 = 90.

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages of rats. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 6 * number of rats. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats is 3 times the number of rats in each cage. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as x. Then, the total number of rats is 3x. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.

We know that the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 90. So, we can set up the equation 18x = 90.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 18: x = 90 / 18 = 5.

"To find the number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the number of trees that die.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Every year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net gain of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

After 10 years, the total number of trees Tom has planted is 10 * 10 = 100 trees, and the total number of trees he has chopped down is 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

So, the net gain of trees after 10 years is 100 - 20 = 80 trees.

Adding this to the initial number of trees, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees after 10 years.

However, 30% of the trees die. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

Finally, the number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now we know that the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt, then divide that by her hourly wage.

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours = 44

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, which is the initial amount borrowed plus 10% of that amount.

Initial amount borrowed: $2000
Additional amount (10% of $2000): $2000 * 0.10 = $200
Total amount owed: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Since Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months:

Total amount paid: $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed to find the remaining balance:

Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251.

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes 40 - 8 = 32.

After buying 14 grass type cards, the number of grass type cards becomes 20 + 14 = 34.

New total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Now, we can find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:

Together, Kalinda and her mom can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, it will take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

So, Ashlyn took 36 melons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. 
3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 melons.

"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate his weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, his weekly consumption is:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. So, their combined weekly consumption is:

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To meet their combined weekly consumption, Steve needs:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week per vine = 21 vines

So, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their combined weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens.

When the ink runs low, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, after using the initial 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens, which can be mixed to make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, Ram has 5 new pens and 0 empty pens. When the ink runs low in these 5 pens, he will have 5 empty pens, which can be mixed to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

Now, Ram has 1 new pen and 0 empty pens. When the ink runs low in this 1 pen, he will have 1 empty pen, which is not enough to make a new pen (since it takes 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen).

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is the sum of the initial pens, the first set of new pens, and the second set of new pens: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dolly has 2 books and reads her own, so she reads 2 books.
2. Dolly also reads Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly reads a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.
3. Pandora has 1 book and reads her own, so she reads 1 book.
4. Pandora also reads Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora reads a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books they collectively read:

Dolly reads 3 books and Pandora reads 3 books, so the total number of books they collectively read is 3 + 3 = 6.

However, this counts each book twice (once for each person), so we need to divide the total by 2 to get the actual number of unique books read:

6 / 2 = 3

But this is incorrect as the question asks for the total number of books read, not unique books. So the correct answer is 6.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes in a week.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, the total number of letters exchanged per week is 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages exchanged per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 60 pages per week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page, so the total time he spends writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to break down the information step by step.

2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To find 'x', we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to find out how many dozens of cookies she is making in total. 

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. 
36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the total number of dozens.
66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed.
5.5 * 2 = 11 cups of flour

"To heat the oil to 300 degrees, it takes 20 minutes. 
To heat the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes. 
40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 
The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. 
It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

The car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles. Since the car in the slow lane is covering the same distance, we can use the same distance (480 miles) and the speed of the car in the slow lane (30 miles/hour) to find the time.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2

= 16

However, this calculation assumes that the paper is folded in a way that allows for 2 pages per side. But in the given arrangement, page 1 is on the left back and page 32 is on the right back, which means that the paper is folded in a way that allows for 4 pages per piece of paper (2 on the front and 2 on the back).

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonuses.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Since Watson works 5 days a week and 10 hours a day, his total hours worked per week is 5 * 10 = 50 hours. 

His weekly earnings from his hourly wage is 50 hours * $10/hour = $500 per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, his total earnings from his hourly wage is $500/week * 4 weeks = $2000.

He also gets a $300 bonus each week. For 4 weeks, that's $300 * 4 = $1200.

His total earnings for the month is $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate the number of people he lost to out of the total number of people he arm-wrestled.

John arm-wrestled 20 people and won 80% of the time. To find the number of people he won against, we multiply 20 by 0.8 (which is 80% in decimal form).

20 * 0.8 = 16

This means John won against 16 people. To find the number of people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he won against from the total number of people he arm-wrestled.

20 - 16 = 4

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks (8 pounds), we need to divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.

8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks.

"To calculate the total savings, we need to find the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and the sale price is $11. The savings from one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. 

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We can set up the equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

(2D + D) + D/2 = 105
3D + D/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

6D + D = 210
7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

1/4 of the total number of people left, so the number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that a total of 10 people left, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

24 (pencils in boxes) / 3 (boxes) = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we add Jam's and Meg's pencils to find the total pencils they have.
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first find the number of junior and senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since there are 100 employees in total, and 40 are junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

However, we need to note that not all 60 remaining employees are programmers. The problem doesn't specify the number of non-programmers, but we can infer that the 60 includes non-programmers. We can only calculate the total amount of money paid to programmers if we assume the remaining 60 are all programmers, which is likely not the case. However, we will proceed with this assumption for the sake of calculation.

The junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month. The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs to be charged to 100%. The remaining percentage points to be charged is 100 - 60 = 40 percentage points.

Since the phone charges at the rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 minutes to charge the remaining 40 percentage points.

"To find the percentage increase in daily earnings, we need to calculate the difference in daily earnings and then divide it by the original daily earnings.

Original daily earnings (tractors) = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
Current daily earnings (silos) = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Difference in daily earnings = $1100 - $1000 = $100
Percentage increase = (Difference / Original daily earnings) * 100

The cost of food per month is $25 per week * 4 weeks per month = $100 per month.
The cost of treats per month is $20.
The cost of medicine per month is $100.

The total monthly expenses are $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month.

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she bought.

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. Twice as many as 30 is 2 * 30 = 60. So, the school needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots in total.

April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the number she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

"To find the total time John spent, we need to first calculate the time he spent on each activity. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 
So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so we can set up the equation:
15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time spent.

To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, the total time spent is 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20

At her first job, Annabelle earns $10 per hour and works 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200. 

At her second job, Annabelle earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

Adding these amounts to her initial savings, Annabelle now has 80 + 200 + 75 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, Annabelle still needs 400 - 355 = $45.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the total amount he had, including the extra $10 his mother gave him.

Dean initially had $28. He bought 6 toy cars for $2 each, so the total cost of the toy cars is 6 x $2 = $12. He also bought 5 teddy bears for $1 each, so the total cost of the teddy bears is 5 x $1 = $5.

The total amount Dean spent is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean's mother gave him an extra $10, so the total amount he had is $28 + $10 = $38.

Now, we subtract the total amount Dean spent from the total amount he had: $38 - $17 = $21.

The cost per person for a round of mini-golf is $5.
The cost per person for arcade tokens is $5.
The cost per person for two go-kart rides is $10 * 2 = $20.

The total cost per person is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Now, we'll divide the total budget by the cost per person to find out how many people Morgan can invite, including herself. Since Morgan is also included in the total number of people, we'll subtract 1 from the result to find the number of friends she can invite.

Total budget / cost per person = $90 / $30 = 3

"To find out how much Marisa saves each day, we need to calculate the cost of the lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day.
She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of the lollipops is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents = $1

Now, let's subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money:

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards from the information given.

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of the gumballs is:
40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must have been twice the cost of the gumballs:
$2 * 2 = $4

This means that after buying the candy, Billy had $4 in change. Since he started with $10, the cost of the candy must have been:
$10 - $4 = $6

Now, we know the candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds Billy bought is:
$6 / $1.5/pound = 4

"To find the total distance the train travels in one day, we need to calculate the distance of the entire trip. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles. 
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 
The combined distance of the first two legs is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles. 

The total distance of the trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. 
Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles. 

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total miles the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total miles traveled in a day (900 miles). 

18,000 / 900 = 20

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

2. A number equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

   So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
   3 * 7 = 21

   So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

4. Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for the three reasons mentioned:

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first determine how many points Erin has now. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. 

Since Sara scored 8, three times more than Sara's points would be 3 * 8 = 24. However, this is three times more than Sara's points, not the total points Erin has now. To find Erin's total points now, we need to subtract Sara's points from this total, but since it is three times more, we can just add Sara's points to find the total. 

So, Erin's total points now is 24 + 8 = 32, but we are given that Erin scored 14 points. Therefore, Erin's total points now is 14 + x = 32, where x is Erin's points before.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she had initially and then subtract the cards she passed out, and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so she had:
20 (cards she made) + 2 * 15 (cards from her dad) = 20 + 30 = 50

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away:
24 + 5 = 29 cards

Now, subtract the cards she passed out from the total cards she had initially:
50 - 29 = 21

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so add those to the cards she has left:
21 + 17 = 38

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the number of slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark, and then subtract that from the total number of slices, along with the 2 slices Jenny ate.

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 slices.
Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.
Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices taken is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

The number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3.

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to calculate the total amount he still needs to save and then divide it by his daily earnings.

Mark already has $50, and the bike costs $300, so he needs to save $300 - $50 = $250 more.

Mark earns $10 per day, so to find out how many days he needs to save, we divide the amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10):

$250 ÷ $10 = 25

"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the number of days he works in a year and multiply it by his daily wage.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
52 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 312 days/year

However, the problem states that the builder works 4 weeks every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is:
12 months/year * 4 weeks/month = 48 weeks/year

So, the total number of days he works in a year is:
48 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

The builder's daily wage is $50. Therefore, his total earnings in a year are:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400

"To find the total energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used per day and then the energy saved per day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours per day.

The original energy usage per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

The new energy usage per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (Wh) or 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

The energy saved per day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the energy saved in 30 days, multiply the energy saved per day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we divide 20 by 4 to get the number of sandwiches needed.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient.

Meat: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Cheese: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Now, we multiply the weight of each ingredient by its cost.

Meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to get the total cost.

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to first determine the initial number of corns and cannolis, then add the additional items he bought.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

The total number of corns is 80 + 60 = 140.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 + 100 = 240.

2. He finished half of his steps (10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

Now, let's calculate the steps Elliott took before his jog:
- Steps taken to and from school: 5,000
- Steps taken with his friend: 1,000
- Total steps taken before jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Since Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps and he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the total steps taken before and during the jog would be:
10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000

"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read the book and then subtract that from the total time he has before leaving for the airport.

The book is 45 pages long, and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find the time it takes him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby needs to leave by is:
60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Since Toby will finish reading the book in 30 minutes, he will leave for the airport in 30 minutes. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the time it takes him to read the book and get to the airport from the total time he has:
60 minutes - (30 minutes + 10 minutes) = 20 minutes

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30.
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600.
The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total amount she spent: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events.

First, let's find the number of candles that will explode. Since 1% of the candles are not guaranteed not to explode (i.e., they may explode), we can calculate this as:

Number of candles that may explode = 1% of 50,000

= 500

Next, let's find the number of candles that have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. This is given as 5% of the more dangerous candles, which are the ones that may explode. So, we can calculate this as:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = 5% of 500

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
3. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as x.

Now, let's consider her sister's gathering:

1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
2. She gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
3. She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation:

2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute the value of 'c' into the first equation to find 'd':
124 + d = 180

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Since this is the total distance for 2 days, we don't need to divide it by 2.

On the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

He shared these 20 lollipops equally among his 4 friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to first find the weight of the cake that Rory and her mom ate. Since they each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces. 

Rory and her mom ate 2 pieces, so they ate 2 * 2.5 = 5 ounces. 

The weight of the remaining cake is the original weight minus the weight eaten: 20 - 5 = 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. The total number of oranges is 34 + 22 = 56.

Since they want to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, which is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges (56) by the total number of people (8). 
56 ÷ 8 = 7

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine doubles the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater and then add the 5 minutes she wants to arrive before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long, the drive from Bernadette's apartment will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards). First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. So, she bought 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 * 20 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. So, she bought 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has 7 * 20 = 140 beads.

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. The difference is 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature changes due to the oven and the open window.

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The temperature cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is equal to 3 sets of 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease due to the open window is:
3 sets * 2 degrees/set = 6 degrees

The final temperature of the house is:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, James' swim time = 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so James' bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

We know Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time. 

James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time = 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (1 hour = 60 minutes).

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours at 32MPH:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 32MPH x 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Cost = Total hay x Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails x $3/bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

$5 x 6 = $30

Now, we can calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

Change = Total money - Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has and then divide that by the number of eggs needed per tray.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs. 
1 dozen = 12 eggs
4 dozen eggs = 4 * 12 = 48 eggs
Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs needed per tray. 
Each glass needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses, so each tray needs 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

Now, let's divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per tray.
50 eggs / 25 eggs per tray = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker is $576 / 48 = $12.

On Monday, he sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is 17 * $20 = $340.

The rest of the sneakers sold were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers. They were sold for $25 each, so the revenue from the rest of the week is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The total cost is $576.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $1115 - $576 = $539.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option and the regular ticket option.

The super ticket option costs $20 (movie ticket) + $1 (popcorn and soda) = $21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket option must be $21 - $2 = $19.

The regular ticket option costs $12 (movie ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn). We know the total cost is $19, so we can set up the equation:

$12 + $3 + x = $19

Combine the constants:
$15 + x = $19

Subtract $15 from both sides:
x = $4

The regular price of popcorn is $4.

Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100

"To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we first need to determine how many songs each of them can add.

Gabriel has 20 songs and can store up to 100 songs. So, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which is 3 * 20 = 60 songs. He can store up to 100 songs, so he can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs 10 miles an hour, we can calculate the total hours he runs a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in five days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, Uncle Ben needs 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

Morning rides: 14 days * 2 rides/day = 28 rides. Each ride costs $6, so the total cost of morning rides is 28 rides * $6/ride = $168.

Afternoon rides: 14 days * 1 ride/day = 14 rides. Each ride costs $2, so the total cost of afternoon rides is 14 rides * $2/ride = $28.

Total cost = cost of morning rides + cost of afternoon rides = $168 + $28 = $196.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects found is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + (x/2 + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine the x/2 terms:

2x + x + 7 = 43

Combine the x terms:

3x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 36

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know Bodhi found 12 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found x/2 = 12/2 = 6 insects

And we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 insects

Usual routine: 4 hours/week * 5 weeks = 20 hours (since 8 weeks - 2 weeks with 5 hours - 1 week with 6 hours = 5 weeks)
Exception weeks: 5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours
Additional exception week: 6 hours

Total hours spent working out = 20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, let's break down the information step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus.

Now, the total number of passengers is 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80 passengers.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on compared to the number who got off. Since 21 people got off, 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus.

Now, the total number of passengers is 59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66 passengers.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22.

2. In 8 years, Jame's age will be 22 + 8 = 30.

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. So, Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

4. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47.

5. The difference in their current ages is 47 - 22 = 25.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. The total cost of the computer and printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

To find the cost of 2 monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

"To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we first need to find out how many seashells the boys brought in total and then calculate the total number of seashells the girls brought. 

Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 seashells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 3000 / 10 = 300.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find out how much Elvis needs to save in total for the month of April. Since his target is $1125, we'll use this as the total.

2. April has 30 days. We'll divide the month into two halves: the first half (1-15 April) and the second half (16-30 April). Each half has 15 days.

3. Let's assume Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he'll save '2x' dollars per day in the second half.

4. The total savings for the first half will be 15x (15 days * x dollars per day), and the total savings for the second half will be 15 * 2x = 30x (15 days * 2x dollars per day).

5. The total savings for the month should be equal to Elvis' target: 15x + 30x = 1125.

6. Combine like terms: 45x = 1125.

7. Divide both sides by 45: x = 25.

8. Since Elvis saves '2x' dollars per day in the second half, he'll save 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this, we get 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm.

However, the question asks about a hot day, but the information given is for cold and warm water. Assuming 'hot' is similar to 'warm', we'll use the time for warm water.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature: 450
Actual temperature: 468
Difference: 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set her oven to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees, given that it's off by 4%.

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know that the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520

To find 4% of x, multiply x by 0.04:
x + 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:
1.04x = 520

Divide both sides by 1.04:
x = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding 30 minutes to this gives us:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time in the same way:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding 5 minutes to this gives us:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we can add the time of the two movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils:
- Total cups: 12 (Judy) + 40 (her friend) = 52 cups
- Total dishes: 24 (Judy) + 44 (her friend) = 68 dishes

Since the question asks for the total number of utensils, we assume that the utensils include both cups and dishes. Therefore, the total number of utensils is 52 + 68 = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of the contacts and then divide it by the total number of contacts.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the contacts. Each box is $100.00, but it's 10% off, so the discount is $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00. The cost of one box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Now, let's calculate the total number of contacts. Each box has 90 contacts, and Pete buys 2 boxes, so the total number of contacts is 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the total number of pairs is 180 / 2 = 90 pairs.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each pair of contacts. The total cost is $180.00, and the total number of pairs is 90. The cost of each pair is $180.00 / 90 = $2.00.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours. At $10 per hour, Jill earned 3 x $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 x 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 x 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours. At $10 per hour, John earned 7 x $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned. 

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water she needs to drink per unit (100 ml). 

8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so R + B + G = 4500.
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so R = 0.99B.
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so G = 1.01B.

We can substitute the expressions for R and G from (2) and (3) into the equation from (1):
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know B, we can find R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the amount of protein he gets per day and then multiply it by 7.

First, we need to find out how many grams of protein John gets per day. Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:

3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day as follows:

200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day

Now, we can calculate the amount of protein John gets per week by multiplying the amount of protein he gets per day by 7:

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

"To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we need to use the information given in the problem. 

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 
One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x. 
One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:
x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:
6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:
x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights. 

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we subtract the 20 non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights to find the number of functioning street lights: 96 - 20 = 76.

"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, twice a week, for 2 hours each time. So, the total number of hours per week is 2 hours/session * 2 sessions/week = 4 hours/week.

Since he went for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125. Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

He started with 20 pieces of gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

In the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day
So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to find the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels based on the given information.

The price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel, so:
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

The cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel, so:
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can calculate the total price of all three jewels:
Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

First, we need to find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed:

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend while keeping the cost per class below $10.

Total cost of classes: $60
Maximum cost per class: $10
Total classes: 10

Let's assume Manny attends 'x' classes. The cost per class will be the total cost divided by the number of classes attended.

Cost per class = Total cost / Number of classes attended
$10 = $60 / x

To find the minimum number of classes Manny must attend, we can rearrange the equation:

x = $60 / $10
x = 6

This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class below $10. If he attends 6 classes, the cost per class will be exactly $10.

To find the number of classes Manny can miss, we subtract the number of classes he must attend from the total number of classes:

Number of classes Manny can miss = Total classes - Number of classes he must attend
= 10 - 6

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.
Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours by 1.5 hours per recipe to find out how many recipes John learns: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes.

"To find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping, we first need to find the number of math teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, the remaining 40% are math teachers.

Number of history teachers = 60% of 150 = 0.6 * 150 = 90
Number of math teachers = 150 - 90 = 60

Now, we can find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping:
Total time = Number of math teachers * Time each teacher sleeps per day
Total time = 60 * 6
Total time = 360

"To find out how much each person would have if they shared their money equally, we first need to determine how much money each person has initially.

Aurelia has $120. 
Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add their money together: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To share the money equally among them, we divide the total by 3: 360 / 3 = 120.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we first need to calculate the total number of good days Christina had in the first 30 days. We know that her first 8 days were good, and then she had 3 more good days after that. 

Total good days in the first 30 days = 12
Good days in the first 8 days = 8
Additional good days = 12 - 8 = 4
Additional good days in the last 3 days = 2

Since we already know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days, and 2 of the last 3 days were good, we can calculate the number of good days left in the month by subtracting the good days in the first 30 days from the total good days in the month (which is the sum of good days in the first 30 days and the good days in the last 3 days).

Total good days in the month = 12 + 2 = 14
Good days left in the month = Total good days in the month - Total good days in the first 30 days = 14 - 12 = 2

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This can be expressed as 2x + 3.

Since Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 21.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 21 - 3, 2x = 18.

Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 18 / 2, x = 9.

"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to convert the current height from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Now, we know the current height (240 inches) and the target height (600 inches). We also know the growth rate (30 inches per day). 

To find the number of days, we need to calculate the difference in height and divide it by the growth rate.

Difference in height = Target height - Current height
= 600 - 240
= 360 inches

Number of days = Difference in height / Growth rate
= 360 / 30

"To find the total number of toys James needs, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12. Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since there were 12 dogs when he left, there were 2 * 12 = 24 more dogs. So, the total number of dogs now is 12 + 24 = 36. James needed 36 toys.

However, when James came back again, 3 dogs were gone. So, the total number of dogs now is 36 - 3 = 33. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 33 toys.

"To find out how much Karen earns, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, we can calculate Karen's hourly wage as follows:

Karen's hourly wage = 2 * Lorie's hourly wage
Karen's hourly wage = 2 * $10
Karen's hourly wage = $20

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days, working 3 hours per day. We can calculate her total earnings as follows:

Total hours worked in 2 days = 2 days * 3 hours/day
Total hours worked in 2 days = 6 hours

Total earnings = Total hours worked * Hourly wage
Total earnings = 6 hours * $20/hour

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 150% of the original length, or 1.5x. 

She then added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20cm.

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140cm. So, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

"Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We also know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation:

2T + 3t = 44

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin:

T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7
T = 13

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, and there are 2 of them, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:

Total chairs currently available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48.

There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming babies will use high chairs, we can assign the 8 high chairs to the babies and the remaining 7 babies will need regular chairs. The 42 adults will also need regular chairs.

"To maximize the number of scoops Erin can buy, she should take advantage of the ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 free"" deal. This means she should buy in multiples of 2 scoops.

The cost of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free) is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.

Erin has $6.00, so she can afford to buy 2 sets of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free).

2 sets of 3 scoops will cost 2 x $3.00 = $6.00.

So, Erin can buy 2 x 3 = 6 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate how much candy each of them has left.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 2 weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.
Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 2 weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.
Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

The difference in the amount of candy they have left is 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking the blueberries is the initial cost of $20 plus the cost per pound of $1.5 times the number of pounds picked, which is 30. 

Cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Number of pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is the cost per pound of $2.5 times the number of pounds, which is 30.

Cost of buying = Cost per pound * Number of pounds
Cost of buying = $2.5 * 30
Cost of buying = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying.

Amount saved = Cost of buying - Cost of picking
Amount saved = $75 - $65
Amount saved = $10

There are 5 pizzas in total, each with 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 x (2/3) x 12 = 3 x 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 x (3/4) x 12 = 2 x 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42.

"To find the average time, we first need to find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. Since the dog takes 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we multiply the cat's time by 2/3.

The cat takes 30 minutes, so the dog takes 2/3 * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we find the average time by adding the cat's and dog's times and dividing by 2.

Average time = (cat's time + dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as x. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

3. Now she has 3 small stickers left (30 - 27 = 3) and 9 large buttons.

4. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. Now she has 3 small stickers, 9 large buttons, and 20 large buttons. In total, she has 29 large buttons.

6. She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

7. Now she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 60 small buttons. Since 1 small sticker = 1 small button, we can convert the small stickers to small buttons. So she has 3 + 60 = 63 small buttons.

8. In total, she has 29 large buttons and 63 small buttons.

Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. 1 large button = 3 small buttons, so 29 large buttons = 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor is 2x, the number of votes in favor is 2 * 11 = 22.

"To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size.

- Extra-small: 11 students
- Small: Twice as many as extra-small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students

- Large: Half as many as medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students
- Extra-large: Six more than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size to find the total number of shirts ordered.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as x. 
Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the second house needs 2x cases of shingles.
The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed is 250. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:
5x = 250

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 50

Now that we know the first house needs 50 cases of shingles, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house:
Third house = 2x = 2 * 50 = 100

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately, then add them together.

Number of students per class: 25

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Number of teachers per class: 3
Number of classes: 40
Total number of teachers: 3 * 40 = 120
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Total number of trees planted: 1000 (by students) + 240 (by teachers) = 1240

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is 'x'. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for 'x', we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Half an hour per day for 14 days is 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. 
2 hours per day for 7 days is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours. 
So, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

Now, we need to calculate the 30% premium. 
30% of $900 = 0.3 * $900 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold.
Total cost = $900 + $270 = $1170.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340.
The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40.
The pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
The pass rate of the fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders, so it is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

The total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first determine the total number of glass chips he has. Since he has two bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, the total number of chips is:

2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total area in square inches:

144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can divide the total area by the height to find the length:

12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed and add it to the remaining amount.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Adding the remaining 10 quarts, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea to gallons by dividing by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped.

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows in total. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

The total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21.

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. To find out how many marshmallows are left, we subtract the number of marshmallows used or dropped from the original number: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since there are 2 kids): 14 / 2 = 7.

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. This friend will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of zest as 'x'. Since she uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, the amount of fragrance is also 'x'.

Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2x. And since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also 2x.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

Now, let's add up the amounts of all the ingredients: 
x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10
10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10: 
x = 1

Now that we know x is 1, we can find the amount of oil:

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the total original length minus the total used length. 
3 * 12 mm = 36 mm (total original length).
36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90
Total number of socks and dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

First, let's find the number of students good at both math and English. We know that there are 20 students in total, 5 are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only. 

So, the number of students good at both math and English = Total students - (students good at math only + students good at English only)

The total time available for performances is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to perform (including getting on and off stage).

Now, we divide the total available time by the time taken by each group: 110 / 10 = 11.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same: $225.

Total interest earned in 3 years = $225 * 3 = $675.

Total amount after 3 years = Original amount + Total interest earned

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. 
So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this number gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the question states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build 96 homes in the third year, not that the total will be 96. So, the correct total is 12 + 36 + 96.

"Let's denote my age as 'A', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as:
A = B - 3

Since I am 2 years older than my sister, we can express this as:
A = S + 2

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so we can express this as:
Mom's age = 3B - 1

When you add all our ages, you get 87. This can be expressed as:
A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

Now, we can substitute A from the first two equations into the last equation. 
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 + 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine like terms:
B - 3 + B + B - 1 + 3B - 1 = 87
Combine like terms:
6B - 5 = 87
Add 5 to both sides:
6B = 92

"To find the number of microphones that won't find any space, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of microphones. 

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

This means 10 microphones won't find any space. The remaining microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

Number of remaining microphones = 50 - 10 = 40

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, we need to divide the number of remaining microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Speed of whatchamacallit = 121 meters per second
Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now, we know that the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob. So, we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5 to find the speed of the whirligig.

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once for $6, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's add up the money she made from mowing lawns: $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

Since Tasha made a total of $80, we can subtract the money she made from mowing lawns to find out how much she made from lemonade sales: $80 - $54 = $26.

Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60 miles

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for small masks and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
To make 20 small masks, she would need 20 / 4 = 5 times the material. 
So, the material needed for 20 small masks is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks: 
Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, she would need 8 / 3 = 2.67 times the material (round up to 2.67 since you can't make a fraction of a mask, but in this case, we are calculating material, so we can use the exact value). 
So, the material needed for 8 large masks is 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

Now, add the material needed for small and large masks: 
10 yards (small masks) + 6 yards (large masks) = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8

Add 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Divide both sides by 2:

A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute L from equation 2 into equation 3:

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced and the total revenue for each machine.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Each widget sells for $6. The total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000 will be 43200 * 6 = $259200. The total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be 32400 * 6 = $194400.

The difference in revenue between the two machines is $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) would cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"To find the amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Amount each sheep needs = 2 * (amount each goat needs) - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 2 * 5 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 10 - 3
Amount each sheep needs = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = number of goats * amount each goat needs
Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = number of sheep * amount each sheep needs
Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

"To find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, he has:
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of a pen:
100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 4

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 
Craig's total letters = 20 words * 15 letters per word = 300 letters.

Since Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to Craig's total letters to find the brother's total letters.
Brother's total letters = 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

She gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gives away is:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles she gives away from the total number of bottles she gets:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.
The discount is 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.
So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got $40 from selling them.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"Let's denote Bahati's points as B, Azibo's points as A, and Dinar's points as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that B + A + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation B + A + D = 45 with A + 20. This gives us A + 20 + A + D = 45.

We also know that B = D + 10, so A + 20 = D + 10. This means D = A + 10.

Now, we can substitute D in the equation A + 20 + A + D = 45 with A + 10. This gives us A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45.

Combine like terms: 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3: A = 5.

Since there are 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, the actual number of pages per inch is 200 (100 pages per inch * 2 sides per paper).

Now, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches to find the total number of pages.

Number of pages per inch: 200 pages/inch
Thickness of the book: 1.5 inches

Total number of pages = Number of pages per inch * Thickness of the book
Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes Vince spent stapling reports is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

We know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the rate of reports per minute:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Now, let's calculate the number of beds occupied after 2 weeks. 
50 patients are admitted each day. 
In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted = 50 * 14 = 700

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 (initially occupied) + 700 (new admissions) = 900 beds

The total number of Pokémon caught by the three is 339. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, so we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces):

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100
Discount on the red car = 40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40
Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Discount on the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Total cost of both cars = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car = $100 + $60 = $160

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Emil is 19 years old now, and when he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means that when Emil is 24, his dad's age will be 24 * 2 = 48.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years (24 - 19 = 5), his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43.

2. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means that when Emil is 24, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7.

3. Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother. 
   Dad's current age: 43
   Brother's current age: 7
   Sum of their ages: 43 + 7 = 50

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from each person and add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90

"To find the total number of servings, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate Charlie's shoe size as follows:

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by the two by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2:

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each plant takes up 12 inches of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between plants is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between plants (30 inches) to find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 27 * 6 = $162 at the store.

Each basket will have 3 petunias at $3.00 apiece, so the cost of petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 apiece, so the cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.
Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply that by 12 months.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

In a year, she sets aside $500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. 
To find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes:

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to cook the shrimp, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to cook 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many groups of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp, then multiply that by the time it takes her to cook one group.

90 / 30 = 3 groups of 30 shrimp

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on low is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on high is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between France and Germany. 

So, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can find her age by multiplying the average age by 2.

Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

Now, we know the ages of Akbar (3), Alessandro (4), and Helene (10). We can find the age of Wilfred by subtracting the sum of their ages from the total age.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine the total number of slices and the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults. Since there are 4 kids and 2 adults, the total number of slices is 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

The number of slices each adult gets is 2x. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. 
So, we add 30 to the total: 61 + 30 = 91

7 more people checked in after dinner, so we add 7: 91 + 7 = 98

The hotel now has 98 guests."

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions and then determine how many of those she will get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions: 
40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
100% - 40% = 60% of the questions are average and difficult
60% of 60 = 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions
36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9
Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

Total points Aries is sure to get: 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since a small stuffed animal costs $4, a large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is $4 * S, and the total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is $12 * L. The total earnings from both is $120, so we can set up the equation:

$4 * S + $12 * L = $120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

$4 * 2L + $12 * L = $120
$8L + $12L = $120
$20L = $120

Dividing both sides by $20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find S:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate the amount each dwarf can mine per day and then multiply it by the number of dwarves and the number of days.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days:
40 dwarves * 36 pounds per day per dwarf * 30 days = 40 * 36 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich and then multiply it by 8.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches:
$1.50 * 8 = $12.

Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

1. The probability of having a substitute teacher is 50% (0.5). 
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), the probability of the whole class getting an extension is 40% (0.4). So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and not giving an extension is 50% * 60% = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (30% chance), the probability of Marcus getting a personal extension is 20% (0.2). So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension is 30% * 80% = 0.3 * 0.8 = 0.24.

Now, let's calculate the total probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50% (0.5)
- Normal teacher with class extension: 50% * 40% = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- Normal teacher without class extension, but with personal extension: 50% * 60% * 20% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06

Total probability of not having to turn in homework: 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.06 = 0.76

Now, subtract this from 1 to find the probability of having to turn in homework:
1 - 0.76 = 0.24

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:
0.24 * 100 = 24%

Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats available for friends and family: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. However, the number of graduates is not given. Since 950 seats are reserved for graduates, we can assume that there are 950 graduates.

Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 ≈ 5

Now, since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3 to find the number of small beans he can eat. 

So, 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to move to 7 more bottles. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next, so we multiply the number of moves by the time per move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

The amount of income Jim lost while in school is the income he would have earned if he had worked for 4 years at his previous job, which is:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

The total amount Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

To calculate the number of years it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we divide the total amount by his new income:

The width of the fabric will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we calculate the area of one piece and then multiply it by 2. 

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Total amount lost = $5 (first race) - $11 (second race, since he won) + $16.50 (third race) = $10.50.

Since he had a win in one of the races, we still consider it as one of the races for the average calculation.

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

Combine like terms:
2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since Betsy's part is 'x + 18', we can now find Betsy's part:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4/pill is 30 * $4 = $120.
4. The cost of 2 hours of parking at $6/hour is 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

"To find the number of emails James responds to in a day, we first need to find the number of emails that don't require a response. 20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, he responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

To find the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 pizzas is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten.
So, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten.
So, the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

In total, there are 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas left.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

The number of small coupons is 700. Since each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, the total cost of mailing the small coupons is:
700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars

The number of big coupons is twice the number of small coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400. Since each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, the total cost of mailing the big coupons is:
1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage:

"To find the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 + 3 = 6.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that were able to deliver the fertiliser:
20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we multiply the number of trucks that delivered by the tons of fertiliser each truck was carrying:
15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to find out the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to find the total number of bananas eaten in a day:
315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is:
10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten in a day:

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and the change she receives.

Since Jenny bought 15 roses, she can buy a dozen (12 roses) for $15 and 3 individual roses for $2 each. The total cost is:
$15 (for a dozen roses) + $6 (for 3 individual roses) = $21

Jenny pays with five $5 bills, which is a total of $25. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:
$25 (amount paid) - $21 (total cost) = $4 (change)

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:
$4 (change) x 4 (quarters per dollar) = 16 quarters

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. It will leave 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after the initial time.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves. So, it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the initial time. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. It will leave 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after the initial time.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves. So, it arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the initial time. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, it arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the initial time.

Since Paul arrives at the initial time (0 minutes), he will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes sold is:

There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To find the extra learning time, we need to calculate the total minutes in a week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week, so there are 60 * 24 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week.

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, so he spends (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes on extra learning time per week.

The total minutes John spends learning per week is 1600 + 630 = 2230 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 2230 / 60 = 37.17 hours.

Distance = 60 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they travel to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance traveled by first train + Distance traveled by second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we'll need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we'll assume she wants to save enough to cover her living expenses for that period. We can calculate her retirement savings goal as follows:

Retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Now, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

To determine how many years Lauren needs to work to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide her retirement savings goal by her annual savings:

Number of years to reach goal = Retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, assuming she starts saving from now, she would need to work for 40 years to reach her retirement savings goal.

Assuming she has been working for some years already, let's assume she has been working for x years. If she has been working for x years, she has already saved 20% of her salary for x years. 

Let's assume she has been working for x years and has saved $20,000x. 

$20,000x + $20,000(40-x) = $800,000

$20,000x + $800,000 - $20,000x = $800,000

$800,000 = $800,000

This equation is true for any x. However, this is not possible in real life. 

Let's try another approach.

Assuming she has been working for x years and has saved $20,000x. 

$20,000x + $20,000(40-x) = $800,000

$20,000x + $800,000 - $20,000x = $800,000

$800,000 = $800,000

This equation is true for any x. However, this is not possible in real life.

Let's try another approach.

Assuming she has been working for x years and has saved $20,000x. 

$20,000x + $20,000 * (number of years she needs to work) = $800,000

$20,000x + $20,000 * (number of years she needs to work) = $800,000

$20,000 * (number of years she needs to work) = $800,000 - $20,000x

(number of years she needs to work) = ($800,000 - $20,000x) / $20,000

(number of years she needs to work) = 40 - x

240 / 40 = 6

Now, we'll multiply 6 by 100 to find 100% of the population.
6 * 100 = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 240 are boys, we subtract 240 from 600 to find the number of girls.
600 - 240 = 360

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we first need to calculate the total miles she can hike in a month with her current plan, and then compare it to her goal.

There are 30 days in June. If Soledad hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her total miles per day would be 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Her total miles for the month would be 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

Since her goal is 9,300 miles, she needs to hike 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 more miles.

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles per day.

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. We know she had a budget of $16 and spent $4 before buying the books. We also know she has $2 left after buying the books.

So, the total amount spent on the books can be calculated as follows:
Initial budget: $16
Amount spent before buying books: $4
Amount left after buying books: $2
Total amount spent on books = Initial budget - Amount spent before buying books - Amount left after buying books
Total amount spent on books = $16 - $4 - $2
Total amount spent on books = $10

Since Anna bought 2 books and both cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on books by 2:
Cost of each book = Total amount spent on books / 2
Cost of each book = $10 / 2
Cost of each book = $5

The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
The average car can go 120 miles per hour. 
So, the 2nd fastest car's speed is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 
So, the fastest car's speed is 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. 

Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince two years ago, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

Now, to find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: 7 + 2 = 9.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs painted is 56. So Arnold and Madeline together painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 
21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately, then add them together.

Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons (200) by the number of crayons per box (8). 

200 / 8 = 25 boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together: 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the total weight in pounds: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply that by the price per plank.

First, we find out how much of the tree can be used to make logs: 
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Then, we calculate the number of logs he can make:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we find out the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money he makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. 

The time spent walking on the beach is given by distance divided by speed. So, we can set up the equation:

2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 'x':

2 = 40x

Now, divide both sides by 40:

x = 2 / 40
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The time spent walking on the sidewalk is given by distance divided by speed:

1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute) = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far and how much more she needs to save.

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of:
$4 per week * 8 weeks = $32

Since Jane wants to save a total of $60, she still needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since Jane saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she still needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to reach her goal:
$28 / $4 per week = 7 weeks

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, 3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.

Then, 2 different trees had 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

Finally, 1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add them together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second mug that will result in a mixture of at least 40 degrees when 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug are combined.

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. The total amount of water in the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The total heat energy of the mixture is the sum of the heat energy of the two components. Since the heat energy is directly proportional to the temperature and the amount of water, we can set up the following equation:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees) = 5 ounces * 40 degrees

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount.

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

So, the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, to find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
It takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. 
Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
So, Gomer ate 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
$26 / $2 = 13

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:
13 * 3 = 39

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
$56 / $8 = 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
7 * 12 = 84

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold is:
84 * 3 = 252

Now, we add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:
39 + 252 = 291

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we calculate the number of rocks sold:

20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each:

12 rocks * $7 = $84

The total cost of the rocks is $100. To find the loss, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

$100 - $84 = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then find the total.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to find the total number of days by adding the days for each type of scene. However, this would be incorrect as it would mean she is working on all three types of scenes simultaneously. 

A better approach is to calculate the total number of days by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the days for each type of scene or by finding the most efficient way to complete the scenes.

However, a more straightforward approach is to calculate the total number of days by finding the total number of days for each type of scene and then finding the maximum of those days.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to find the probability of each ticket winning and then multiply them together.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning:
20% * 60% = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first find out how many seashells they collected in total.

Jim collected 27 seashells. 
Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, so Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
Carrey collected half of what Carlos collected, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

The total number of seashells collected is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends separately, then add them together.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday), so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays.

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, so he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots on weekends.

Now, let's add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. 
The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 
To find the length of the second song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
Total time = 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, for a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices. The cost of each device is $20, so the total cost is 6 x $20 = $120.

He sells each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40 per device. The total selling price is 6 x $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost: $240 - $120 = $120.

"To determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs. 

Since 1 bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy needs, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs.

Now, to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day, the number of additional bottles needed is 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then the number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla has 8 babies (octuplets), and 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, the number of babies wearing purple is:
8 * (3/4) = 6

The number of babies wearing blue is:
8 * (1/4) = 2

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows. All the blue-wearers (2 babies) wear bows, and 1/3 of the purple wearers (6 babies) wear bows:
(1/3) * 6 = 2

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and multiply by 100:

"To find the total number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 60% of the combined total of the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the combined total is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
Since the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so 0 fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree. Since it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the number of fruits produced each year:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B and B = Y - 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get:

4B + B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:
B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means Rissa gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. 

So, the amount of money Rissa gave to her sister is 1/5 * $15 = $3.

Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister.

Ronnie initially had $5, so the amount of money left with Ronnie is $5 - $3 = $2.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is $12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
   Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home.
   The number of 20 dollar bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   Half of 40 is 40 / 2 = 20. So, he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

4. The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.

5. Thomas then triples his money.
   Tripling his money means multiplying by 3, so he now has 400 * 3 = 1200 dollars.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find 20% of the original 5 inches, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

However, we should calculate 20% of the remaining chalk for each day. 
20% of 2.75 inches is 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used each day (0.55 inches) to find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk.

2.75 / 0.55 = 5 days.

However, since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to check if the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches after 5 days.

After 5 days, the teacher will have 2.75 - (0.55 * 5) = 2.75 - 2.75 = 0 inches of chalk left, which is not possible. This means the teacher will run out of chalk before the 5th day.

Let's recalculate the days until the chalk is smaller than 2 inches.

Day 1: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches
Day 2: 2.20 - 0.44 (20% of 2.20) = 1.76 inches
Day 3: 1.76 - 0.35 (20% of 1.76) = 1.41 inches
Day 4: 1.41 - 0.28 (20% of 1.41) = 1.13 inches
Day 5: 1.13 - 0.23 (20% of 1.13) = 0.90 inches
Day 6: 0.90 - 0.18 (20% of 0.90) = 0.72 inches
Day 7: 0.72 - 0.14 (20% of 0.72) = 0.58 inches
Day 8: 0.58 - 0.12 (20% of 0.58) = 0.46 inches
Day 9: 0.46 - 0.09 (20% of 0.46) = 0.37 inches
Day 10: 0.37 - 0.07 (20% of 0.37) = 0.30 inches
Day 11: 0.30 - 0.06 (20% of 0.30) = 0.24 inches
Day 12: 0.24 - 0.05 (20% of 0.24) = 0.19 inches

The chalk will be smaller than 2 inches after 12 days, but it will be smaller than 2 inches on the 12th day. So, the teacher has 11 days before he has to recycle the chalk.

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 quarters in an hour (60 minutes / 15 minutes per quarter), 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour.

Jay's net snowball production rate per hour is 20 (built) - 8 (melted) = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs (60) by his net production rate (12 snowballs per hour).

Time = 60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours.

The answer is: 5"
"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference. Since John is 28 now and the anniversary is 20 years after the initial event, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old when Digimon came out.

At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. So, Jim's age at that time can be found by dividing John's age by 2: 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add the 20 years that have passed to his age at that time: 4 + 20 = 24.

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to determine how many slices each person ate. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, we add up the slices eaten by each person: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6

"To find out how many bandages the nurses started with, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the order on the third day.

However, it's given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Adding the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) and the second day (12 + 28 = 40, then 40 - 28 = 12, then 12 + 3 = 15), we get 15 bandages. However, we know that 12 bandages were left at the end of the first day and 3 bandages were left from the previous days at the end of the third day. So, the 3 bandages were left from the second day. 

On the second day, they used 28 bandages and had 3 bandages left. So, they had 28 + 3 = 31 bandages at the start of the second day.

On the first day, they ordered 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left at the end of the first day. Since they had 31 bandages at the start of the second day, they must have started with 31 - 12 = 19 bandages on the first day, before ordering 50 more.

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of scotch and then the cost of one bottle of cognac.

The cost of 10 bottles of scotch is $600, so the cost of one bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since the bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle, the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the bottles of cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'.

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" is 40. This can be translated into an equation:

4x + 8 = 40

Now, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find the value of 'x':

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of remaining fish after subtracting the fish with red stripes. 

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Now, we need to calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish to find the number of fish with blue stripes.

Number of fish with blue stripes = 5/11 * 44
Number of fish with blue stripes = 5 * 4
Number of fish with blue stripes = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

"To find out how much money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he sold to his uncle.

Walter started with 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. So, he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

He then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. So, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, the total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"To find the distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total hours he traveled and then multiply it by his average speed.

There are 24 hours in a day. Since Michael traveled for 3 days, the total hours he traveled is:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we will divide the distance covered by Michael by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother and the number of grapes used by their mother.

Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the total number of books a single bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books (110) by the number of books a single bookcase can hold (55). 

110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate her total cost and total revenue.

Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. 
She bought them for $2.40 a dozen, so her total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

She will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so she will sell 60 / 3 = 20 sets of eggs for $1 each. 
Her total revenue will be 20 x $1 = $20.

Her profit will be her total revenue minus her total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original cost of the bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Total cost after discount: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the total cost to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we multiply the total cost by 100.

$15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks in the bag to find the cost per stick.

Cost per stick = Total cost in cents / Number of sticks
Cost per stick = 1500 cents / 30
Cost per stick = 50 cents

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write an equation:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes. So, we can write another equation:

s + b = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting 's' into the first equation:

b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

Number of blueberry cubes: 96"

There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, so the total number of flashlights is 4. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, so that's 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights. In total, there are 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

For the candles, half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each (4 * 4 = 16 candles) and the other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each (4 * 5 = 20 candles). In total, there are 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles: 20 + 36 = 56.

"To find out how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required and then subtract the number of hot dogs he already has.

Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, and there are 20 guests, so the total number of hot dogs required is 2 * 20 = 40.

John already has 4 hot dogs, so he needs 40 - 4 = 36 more hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, John needs to buy 36 / 6 = 6 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so John needs to spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs.

"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 * 7 = 210 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation is 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes. In 4 weeks, the total time spent on yoga is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 at the original price of $8 each. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt costs $8, and the second one costs 50% of $8, which is $4. So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price: $40 - $16 = $24.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can divide by 2 to find 'w':

w = 15

Now that we know 'w', we can substitute it into the first equation to find 'c':
