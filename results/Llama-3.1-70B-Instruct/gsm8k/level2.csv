"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Number of eggs laid per day: 16
Number of eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
Number of eggs used for baking muffins: 4
Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7
Number of eggs sold: 16 - 7 = 9

Price per egg: $2
Total amount made per day: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and then subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 100% (original value) + 150% (increase) = 250% of the original value.

Since the original value of the house was $80,000, the new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, this is the value of the house itself, not the total value after repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, we can set up an equation to find the total value after repairs:

Total value after repairs = Original value of house + Increase in value
Total value after repairs = $80,000 + (150% of $80,000)
Total value after repairs = $80,000 + (1.5 * $80,000)
Total value after repairs = $80,000 + $120,000
Total value after repairs = $200,000

But we know that the $50,000 in repairs also increased the value, so the total value after repairs is actually $200,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost:
Profit = Total value after repairs - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3 sprints * 3 times a week = 3 * 3 = 9 sprints

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the full-priced glasses and the discounted glasses separately. 

Since every second glass is discounted, Kylar will buy 8 full-priced glasses and 8 discounted glasses.

The cost of the full-priced glasses is 8 * $5 = $40.

The cost of the discounted glasses is 8 * ($5 * 0.6) = 8 * $3 = $24.

The total cost is $40 + $24 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep, we need to find the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep:

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it took to download 40% of the file, add the 20 minutes for the restart, and then add the time it takes to download the entire file.

First, let's find 40% of the file size: 
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it took to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download the entire file is:
200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it took to download 40% of the file, the 20 minutes for the restart, and the time it takes to download the entire file:
40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and then subtract the distance he traveled in the 4 hours on the way back.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the 4 hours on the way back:
- 2 hours in standstill traffic: 0 miles
- 0.5 hours at 30 mph: 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles
- Remaining time at 80 mph: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
Distance traveled at 80 mph = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Total distance traveled in the 4 hours on the way back = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since John initially traveled 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours is:
180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the number of downloads in the third month, we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree. Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total cost is $90 (initial cost) + $3x (annual cost).

The total revenue is the number of lemons grown per year multiplied by the selling price per lemon, multiplied by the number of years. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue is 7 * $1.5 * x = $10.5x.

To start earning money, the total revenue should be greater than the total cost. We can set up an inequality:

$10.5x > $90 + $3x

Subtract $3x from both sides:

$7.5x > $90

Divide both sides by $7.5:

x > 12

Since x must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a year), the smallest whole number greater than 12 is 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She sold 2 more to the red house. 
So, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green and red houses is x - (x/3 + 2) = (2x/3) - 2.

She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x/3 + 2 + x/3 - 1 = 2x/3 + 1.

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so the number of vacuum cleaners she started with minus the number she sold is 5. 
x - (2x/3 + 1) = 5
x - 2x/3 = 6
x/3 = 6
x = 18

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the future value of each investment.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Rate of return = 2.5% = 0.025
Future value = Initial value * (1 + Rate of return)
Future value = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025)
Future value = $5,000 * 1.025
Future value = $5,125

Profit from jewelry = Future value - Initial value
Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000
Profit from jewelry = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Rate of return = 1.2% = 0.012
Future value = Initial value * (1 + Rate of return)
Future value = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012)
Future value = $8,000 * 1.012
Future value = $8,096

Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value - Initial value
Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000
Profit from electronic gadgets = $96

Since the profit from the jewelry ($125) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Jill's total annual salary is the sum of her earnings from teaching and coaching:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert that to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the entire 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

The time she has left to complete the remaining 6 miles is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. Since 1 liter was spilled, we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his age at the time of his son's birth.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can find Raymond's current age by adding 6 to Samantha's age:
Raymond's current age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's current age = 31 + 6
Raymond's current age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - age at son's birth
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. We can write this as:

0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x

The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 
25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. 
20 more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165. 
13 * 15 = 195 
165 / 15 = 11

So John sold 11 lego sets for $165.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

First, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 
Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find the total cost. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). The cost of one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so the cost of 2 pounds is:
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's find the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and then subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We are given that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Combine like terms:

-140 + x = 23

Add 140 to both sides:

x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to find the number of blue ties and the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie:

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. 

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each. There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find the total number of pets, we need to determine the number of pets each person has. 

Cindy has 4 pets. 
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we add the number of pets each person has to find the total:

"To find Jackson's age, we need to determine the ages of the other children first. 

Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, and James is 10 years old, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

Jackson is 4 years old."
"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's original time: 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time to get his new time.

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds
Gerald's new time: 40 - 4 = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to find the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of pet dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes (since 64 / 2 = 32).

Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16 to get the number of cans: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to get the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of potted plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants initially. 

She received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we can add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell to find the total number of doorbell rings:
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

Total pages = 39

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages are left.

Pages left = Total pages - Pages read
Pages left = 39 - 15
Pages left = 24

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks 1 glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days (since he has soda on the other day), so we add 1 more glass, making it 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 7 = 27.

"To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to set up a proportion. 

First, we know that it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We can set up a ratio of time to distance: 10 minutes / 3 miles.

We want to find the time it takes to cover 42 miles. We can set up a proportion using the ratio:

10 minutes / 3 miles = x minutes / 42 miles

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

10 * 42 = 3 * x
420 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 420 / 3
x = 140

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

The inner volume of each box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, we subtract the hours watched on other days from the total hours: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we divide the total minutes by the length of each episode (30 minutes) to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

Rate = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we find the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore:
Time to reach shore = 64 seconds
Distance = Rate * Time = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we can write an equation:
Jamal's phone capacity = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity
1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity
Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

From point 2, we can write an equation:
Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * number of birds in Jamal's photograph

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

27 / 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

(2/3) * 9 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

The cost of the subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of the chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of the cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
The total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Adding the $5.00 tip, the final cost is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed and subtract that from the total number of questions.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours and completed 5 questions per hour. 
So, the number of questions he completed in the first test is 8 * 5 = 40.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours and completed 5 questions per hour. 
So, the number of questions he completed in the second test is 6 * 5 = 30.

The total number of questions Mark completed is 40 + 30 = 70.

The total number of questions in both tests is 75 + 100 = 175.

The number of questions Mark left incomplete is 175 - 70 = 105.

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q. 
We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700. 
Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. 
Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700. 
Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W. Since W = 4Q, we get W = 4(100) = 400.

"To find out how long the winner will be waiting, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home and then find the difference.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. The time Steve will be waiting is the difference between their times.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards. 

We know that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon 'x'. Then, 1/3 of x is 6 (since the raccoon stole 2/3, 1/3 remains). So, x/3 = 6, and x = 18.

Before the raccoon, there were 18 fries. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. So before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

A seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14/2 = 7 fries. So before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

This is the number of fries after Dave ate 14. So the original number of fries is 34 + 14 = 48.

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the hours spent per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, the total hours for these days are 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, the total hours for these days are 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Total hours per week = 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours spent attending classes in a semester = 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, each round trip is 200 yards. So, Blake ran 15 x 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards each way). So, Kelly ran 200 + (34 x 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake ran the most. To find out how much farther Blake ran, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months and apply it 18 times (36 months / 2 months per increase).

Initial price = $20
Increase every 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Price after 4 months = $24 + 20% of $24 = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + 20% of $28.80 = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

We can see a pattern emerging, but to simplify the calculation, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

Price after n increases = Initial price * (1 + increase rate)^n

In this case, the increase rate is 20% or 0.20, and n is the number of increases, which is 18 (36 months / 2 months per increase).

Price after 36 months = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18
Price after 36 months ≈ $20 * 7.485

"To find the number of red roses Sandra ordered, we first need to find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. 

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Number of red roses = 4 * number of white carnations
= 4 * 40

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From statement 3, we know Jan's current age is 30.

From statement 2, two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so Mark's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark's age two years ago was 19, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

From statement 1, Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23.

Jean's age is 23."
"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team and then find the difference.

The well-rounded team has all members running at 55 seconds each. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running at 60 seconds, the second runner at 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner at 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner at 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time taken by this team is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, to find the difference in time, we subtract the time taken by the faster team from the time taken by the slower team:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of favorable outcomes. Since Jerry is rolling a six-sided die, the numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of a total of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25.

Now, to find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 
0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.25 * 100 = 25%

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages with equal groups of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r.

There are 10 cages of hamsters, each with 1 hamster, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total straw given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The total straw distributed among the small rodents is 160. We also know that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total straw given to rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

18r + 50 = 140

Subtract 50 from both sides:

18r = 90

Divide both sides by 18:

r = 5

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total cost price per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

The selling price per bag is $30. 

The profit per bag is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $30 - $22 = $8.

The total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 400

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

"To find the number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, then subtract the number of trees that die.

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net gain is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year. After 10 years, he has gained 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

The total number of trees after 10 years is 50 (initial trees) + 80 (gained trees) = 130 trees.

30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, her total earnings from babysitting is 4 * $5 = $20.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. So, her total savings before mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, and Sara already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours, so his total cost is:
$18/hour * 5 hours = $90

Now, we add the costs together to find the total:
$90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus and the number of days for the return trip by car.

The trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days.

Since it takes half as many days to travel by car, the return trip will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (to Rochester by bus) + 3 (return by car) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to find the total number of cards and the number of water type cards after the changes.

Initially, James had 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. He lost 8 water type cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards left. He bought 14 grass type cards, so the total number of grass type cards is 20 + 14 = 34.

The total number of cards is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards: 32/96 = 0.3333.

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.3333 * 100 = 33.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33.

"To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to find the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can add pieces.

Kalinda's rate: 4 pieces per minute
Her mom's rate: half of Kalinda's rate = 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute
Combined rate: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute

Now, we can find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle:
Total pieces: 360
Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Time = 60 / 60
Time = 1 hour

"To find the number of melons that were ready for harvest after two months, we need to calculate 30% of 120. 

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, Ashlyn took 36 melons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find the number of melons that were ready, we need to calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = (3/4) * 84 = 63

So, Ashlyn harvested 63 melons, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 melons.

The number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so for 12 cars, it's 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells, we can calculate Kylie's Monday collection as follows:

Kylie's Monday collection = Robert's Monday collection + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 20 + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 25

Now, we know Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. So, we can calculate Kylie's Tuesday collection as follows:

Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 * Kylie's Monday collection
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 * 25
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 50

One-third of the penguins went inside the cave: 36 / 3 = 12

Total penguins that left: 12 + 12 = 24

Now, subtract the total penguins that left from the original number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he and his girlfriend eat per week. 

Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats. So, his girlfriend eats 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Together, they eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, to find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

63 / 3 = 21

So, Steve needs 21 vines."
"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

There are 20 friends, and each friend needs 4 slices, so the total number of slices required is:

Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we can divide the total number of slices required by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order:
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

"To find out how many more candies John has than James, we need to first determine the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54

where x is the number of candies Robert has.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 54 / 2
x = 27

So Robert has 27 candies.

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, James has:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora.

Dolly has 2 books and reads Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly reads 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora has 1 book and reads Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora reads 1 + 2 = 3 books.

In total, they collectively read 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To find the number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page. To find the total time he spends writing a week, we multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write a page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly limit.

He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day for 30 days, so the total minutes used for these calls are:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls. So, the total minutes used are:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, subtract the total minutes used from his monthly limit:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

"To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know Griffin ended up with 27 fries. Colby took 3 less than Kyle, who took 5. So Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Now, before Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 27 + 2 = 29 fries.

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.

Before Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had 29 + 10 = 39 fries.

Kyle took 5 fries, so before Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had 39 + 5 = 44 fries.

Griffin started with 24 fries, so Ginger gave Griffin 44 - 24 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we need to first find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the equation:

2x = 28

where x is the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 14

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we divide the total number of fish by 2:

Number of fish in each aquarium = 14 / 2 = 7

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate, we need to calculate the number of cookies she ate on both days. 

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue and her sister ate. 
Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.
Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.
Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.
Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue.
9200 - 3600 = 5600

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school and then the total number of girls in the first two classes.

Since the school is 50% girls and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60. 
The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school to find the number of girls in the third class: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls (not 10, as mentioned initially). So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since the tree is 200 feet tall and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height by 10 to find the number of sections: 
200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to find the total weight:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the tree, we need to find 30% of the total weight and subtract it from the total weight:
30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and 3 trucks can only carry 3 * 2000 = 6000 pounds, which is exactly the weight of the flagstones, the answer is:

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles, we can use this distance for the car in the slow lane as well.

time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to first find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: 10x - 10 = 39 (since they have 10 times less medals)

10x = 39 + 10
10x = 49

x = 49 / 10
x = 4.9

However, the number of medals must be a whole number. Since 10 times less medals is 39, we can rewrite the equation as: x - 10 = 39 (since they have 10 less medals)

x = 39 + 10
x = 49"
"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars and then subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

4 adults get 6 chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get: 16 / 8 = 2.

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so the actual time spent working is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2.5 hours is equal to 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes is 150 / 10 = 15.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are 15 * $5 = $75.

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points, we need to first calculate their points after 3 rounds and then add the extra points.

Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's add the extra points. 
Mike has over 20 points, so he gets 1 extra point. 
Jim does not have over 20 points, so he gets 0 extra points. 
Tony has over 20 points, so he gets 1 extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points after the extra points:
Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
Jim: 18 + 0 = 18 points
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of page arrangement when folding a newspaper or tabloid. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically and unfolded, the pages are arranged in the following order: 
- The front side of the paper has pages 2, 3, 4, etc. (even numbers on the right and odd numbers on the left).
- The back side of the paper has pages 1, 32, 31, 30, etc. (page 1 on the left back and the remaining pages in reverse order).

Since the pages are arranged in this pattern, we can see that each piece of paper has 4 pages printed on it (2 on the front and 2 on the back). 

To find the total number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we divide the total number of pages by 4.

We know that she sold 45 books this year and that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books and that she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40 loaves.

So, 60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left after the morning sales.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally, we need to first find the total number of guns they have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (Richard) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the names, as 'RJ' and 'Richard' are likely the same person. Assuming 'RJ' is actually 'Richard' and the correct number of guns Richard has is 1 (not 5), we will recalculate with the correct information.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, and Richard has 1 gun. There is no Jason in the list, but we have a 'Jason' mentioned in the question. Assuming Jason has the 5 guns (previously incorrectly assigned to Richard), we can now calculate the total number of guns.

Total guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + Jason's guns + Richard's guns
Total guns = 8 + 10 + 5 + 1
Total guns = 24

Now, we will divide the total number of guns by the number of people to find out how many guns each of them would have if they share their guns equally.

Number of people = 4
Total guns = 24

Guns per person = Total guns / Number of people
Guns per person = 24 / 4

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals: 
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 240 pounds.

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n – 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal (initial amount borrowed) = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.10/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = 3650 [ 0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 – 1]
M ≈ 3650 [ 0.008333(1.0417) ] / [ 1.0417 – 1]
M ≈ 3650 [ 0.008666 ] / [ 0.0417]
M ≈ 3650 * 0.2077
M ≈ 758.105

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the monthly payment is approximately $758.

"To find out how many kilometers Cho hiked, we multiply the speed (14 km/h) by the time (8 hours): 
14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

To find out how many kilometers Chloe hiked, we multiply the speed (9 km/h) by the time (5 hours): 
9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked to find the difference: 
112 km - 45 km = 67 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos, so the total number of pesos he has is:
50 + 80 = 130 pesos

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos. The total number of pesos Anna has is:
100 + 120 = 220 pesos

Now, we add the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have:
130 + 220 = 350 pesos

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total revenue and subtract her total cost. 

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

Now, let's find her total profit: $36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups in total, she will be open for 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, let's find her profit per hour: $18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find the value of 1 part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total parts in the ratio:

165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now that we know the value of 1 part, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

Jenny gave a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices to Bill and Mark.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so the total number of slices eaten or given away is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day. 

Energy used per day = Power * Time 
Since the power is given in watts, we'll keep the time in hours for now. 
Energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

Now, we need to find the energy used per day when Mel reduces the time by 5 hours. 
New time = 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours.
New energy used per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

Energy saved per day = Original energy used per day - New energy used per day 
Energy saved per day = 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh per day.

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000 (since 1 kWh = 1000 Wh).
Energy saved per day = 4500 Wh / 1000 = 4.5 kWh per day.

Now, we need to find the energy saved in 30 days.
Energy saved in 30 days = Energy saved per day * 30 days
Energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the weight of each ingredient.

Meat: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Cheese: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Now, we multiply the weight of each ingredient by its cost.

Meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30.

   10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods to find the total cost.
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Since the jogger jeans cost $22 and he saved $2, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.

Since the tattered jeans cost $28 and he saved $4, the original price of the tattered jeans was $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees
6 minibuses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees
10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Total capacity = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Lillian also bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Now, we add the number of birds attracted to both types of feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of the soup and the cake, then add it to the cost of the bagel.

The bagel costs $4. 
The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
25% of $4 is 0.25 * $4 = $1.
So the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, the soup, and the cake: 
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To find the number of cards Kenny started with, let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. 

Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells 2/3 of the cards. The number of cards he sells is (2/3)x.

Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is (2/3)x * 1.5 = $x.

We know that he uses this money to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left for spending cash. So, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $100 + $50 = $150.

Now, we can set up the equation: 
x = 150

Since x = (2/3)x * 1.5, we can rewrite the equation as:
x = (2/3)x * 1.5

"To determine the number of hotdogs prepared, we first need to find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, that's 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

The total number of hotdogs prepared would be 36 (for the guests who would have one hotdog) + 18 (for the guests who would have two hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs needed would be 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short would be 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest who didn't get a second hotdog would be short one hotdog, the number of guests who didn't get a second hotdog would be 26.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

To find the discount, we need to calculate 20% of the total cost before the discount.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final cost.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to first find out how many gallons were in each container, then find 1/4 of that amount, and finally convert it to pints.

There were 15 gallons of gas divided into 5 containers, so each container had 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which is 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, 3/4 gallons is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips and how much he had left to spend on candy bars.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he had $0.05 left. This means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, we need to find out how much he spent on candy bars. He spent $4.95 in total and $1.20 on chips, so he spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

He shared these 20 lollipops equally among his 4 friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake. 

First, we find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces: 
20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, they ate 2 pieces in total. 
Weight of the pieces eaten = 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake:
20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

Since they are sharing the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8 people.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges everyone will get.
Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7.

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to get to the theater and then add the extra 5 minutes she wants to arrive before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, 
3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: 
Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: 
Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. So, she bought 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 * 20 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. So, she bought 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has 7 * 20 = 140 beads.

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. The difference is 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

"To find James' time, we first need to find Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
- Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
- 10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
- 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' time for the run:
- James' total time: 180 minutes
- James' swim and bike time: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes
- James' run time: 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can multiply the speed (32 miles per hour) by the time (0.5 hours) to get the distance:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, we can multiply the distance by 1/2 to get the total amount of hay eaten:

Hay eaten = Distance * 1/2
Hay eaten = 16 miles * 1/2
Hay eaten = 8 bails of hay

The cost of the hay is $3 per bail, so we can multiply the amount of hay eaten by the cost per bail to get the total cost:

Total cost = Hay eaten * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

$5 * 6 = $30

Now, we can subtract the total cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has to get the change:

Change = Money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

He sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to the department store for $25 each, so the revenue from the rest of the week is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The profit is the total revenue minus the cost, so the profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

The regular ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3, so the total cost of the ticket and soda is $12 + $3 = $15.

To find the regular price of popcorn, subtract the cost of the ticket and soda from the total cost of the regular ticket option: $19 - $15 = $4.

Since James runs 10 miles an hour, the total hours he runs a week is 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in five days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is 200 / 50 = 4.

"To find the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has, we need to calculate the number of Pomeranians first, then find one third of that number.

Jana has 27 puppies, and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. 
Two thirds of 27 is (2/3) * 27 = 18.

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. 
One third of the Pomeranians are girls, which is (1/3) * 18 = 6.

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the trays, we need to calculate the total number of eggs the trays can hold and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs the trays can hold is 24 * 2 = 48.

Jaime has 64 eggs, so the number of eggs he won't be able to place on the trays is 64 - 48 = 16.

"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors to find the cost per razor: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first determine her age in four years. Since in four years she will be three times as old as Brett is now, and Brett is 14 years old now, we can calculate Angela's age in four years as follows:

Angela's age in four years = 3 * Brett's current age
= 3 * 14

Since this is Angela's age in four years, to find her current age, we need to subtract 4 from this value:

Angela's current age = Angela's age in four years - 4

Angela's current age is 38, but the question asks for her current age, and Brett is 14 now, so Angela is 38 - 4 + 14 - 14 = 38 - 4 = 34 is incorrect.

The cost for the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost for the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want the costs to be equal, we can set up the equation:

We know that L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David).
We also know that D = B/2 (David found half of what Bodhi found).
We are also given that L + D + B = 43 (Together they collected 43 insects).

Substituting D = B/2 into L = D + 7, we get L = B/2 + 7.

Now, substituting L = B/2 + 7 and D = B/2 into L + D + B = 43, we get:
(B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

Combine like terms:
2B/2 + 7 = 43
B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
B = 36

Now that we know B, we can find D:
D = B/2
D = 36/2
D = 18

Now that we know D, we can find L:
L = D + 7
L = 18 + 7
L = 25

"To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we first need to determine the number of onions and potatoes she bought individually.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Onions: 4x = 12 (where x is the number of onions Sophia bought)
Solving for x, we get x = 12 / 4 = 3

Potatoes: 4y = 4 (where y is the number of potatoes Sophia bought)
Solving for y, we get y = 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought = 3 + 1 = 4"
"To find the calorie deficit needed per day, we first need to calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds. 

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds is:
30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Next, we need to find the number of days Andy has to reach his goal. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, we need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th:
December has 31 days, so from December 31st to the end of December is 1 day.
January, February, March, April, May, and June have 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, and 30 days respectively. 
July has 31 days, and we need to consider only 19 days in July.
Total days = 1 (Dec) + 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 19 (Jul) = 201 days

Now, we can calculate the calorie deficit needed per day:
Total calorie deficit / Total days = 105,000 calories / 201 days ≈ 522 calories/day

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. 

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Ada's new daily consumption is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
Initial daily consumption: 12 kWh/h * 24 h = 288 kWh
New daily consumption: 14 kWh/h * 24 h = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the total weekly consumption in kWh.
Initial weekly consumption: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
New weekly consumption: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. We multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kWh to get the weekly bill.
Initial weekly bill: 2016 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3024
New weekly bill: 2352 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is the new bill minus the initial bill.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert 5 days to hours: 5 days * 24 hours/day = 120 hours.

Now, we know that one person can paint half a house in 120 hours. To find the time it would take for one person to paint a whole house, we multiply the time by 2 (since a whole house is twice as big as half a house): 120 hours * 2 = 240 hours.

Now, we know that one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours. To find the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we divide the time by 5 (since there are 5 people working together): 240 hours / 5 = 48 hours.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs each person has:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the first stop is:

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the cost of the printer is:

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know that the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Cost of computer + 2(Cost of monitor) + Cost of printer = $2,400
$1,100 + 2(Cost of monitor) + $700 = $2,400

Combine the constants:
$1,100 + $700 = $1,800
$1,800 + 2(Cost of monitor) = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides:
2(Cost of monitor) = $2,400 - $1,800
2(Cost of monitor) = $600

Divide both sides by 2:
Cost of monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of monitor = $300

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half. Then, he saves 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:

Total savings = (15 days * x) + (15 days * 2x)
Total savings = 15x + 30x
Total savings = 45x

We know that Elvis's monthly savings target is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

45x = 1125

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 45:

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save:

2x = 50

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

"To find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water, we need to calculate 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes him in cold water. 

Twice as long as it takes in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 
2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

Zack's locker = 1/2 * Timothy's locker
Zack's locker = 1/2 * 24
Zack's locker = 12 cubic inches

Now, we can find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
Peter's locker = 1/4 * 12

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total time she spent reading is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read per minute as follows:
2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.33 pages per minute (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
105 minutes * 1.33 pages per minute ≈ 140 pages

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
140 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 240 pages

"Let's denote the nephew's current age as 'x'. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, the nephew's age will be x + 7.

We can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7)

Expanding the equation: 51 = 3x + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides: 30 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3: 10 = x

So, the nephew is 10 years old today.

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the number of goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna.

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals

"To find out how many action figures Peter can buy, we first need to determine how much he spent each day. Since he wants to spend an equal amount each day for a week, we divide his total money by 7.

$70 / 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for these 4 days, he spent:

$10 * 4 = $40

He bought wooden action figures for $40, and each costs $5, so he bought:

$40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he spent the remaining money on plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $70 - $40 = $30 left for the remaining 3 days.

$30 / $2 = 15 plastic action figures

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will give an actual temperature of 520, with the same 4% error.

Let x be the set temperature. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

Actual temperature = x + (0.04x)
= 1.04x

We want the actual temperature to be 520, so we set up the equation:

1.04x = 520

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 1.04:

Price of 1 box after discount: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
Price of 2 boxes after discount: 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Since 1 box contains 90 contacts and lasts 45 days, and assuming Pete wears 1 pair of contacts per day, 2 boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 contacts and last 2 * 45 = 90 days.

Cost per pair of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact

We are also given that the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:
G = 1.01B

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees. The angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he bought each year and add the initial 5 games he received as a gift.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the first year 12 + 5 = 17 games. Adding the initial 5 games, he had 5 + 17 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the second year 24 + 5 = 29 games. Adding these to the 22 games he already had, he had 22 + 29 = 51 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, making the total for the third year 48 + 5 = 53 games. Adding these to the 51 games he already had, he had 51 + 53 = 104 games at the end of the third year.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. 
However, we need to compare it to Ruiz's hourly production. 
So, Marissa makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, we calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours.
Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find the total number of rotations per month, we need to multiply the number of rotations per 2 miles by the number of 2-mile intervals in 400 miles. 

400 miles / 2 miles = 200 intervals
200 intervals * 725 rotations/interval = 145,000 rotations/month

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per year is:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The cost for the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45) is 50% more than the initial monthly funding. To find the increased monthly funding, we calculate 50% of $100,000 and add it to the initial funding:
50% of $100,000 = 0.5 * $100,000 = $50,000
Increased monthly funding = $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000

Now, we calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months:
Cost for remaining 45 months = $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000

Let's assume Manny attends 'x' classes. The cost per class will be the total cost divided by the number of classes attended.

Cost per class = Total cost / Number of classes attended
$10 = $60 / x

To find the minimum number of classes Manny must attend, we can rearrange the equation:

x = $60 / $10
x = 6

This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class below $10. If he attends 6 classes, the cost per class will be exactly $10.

To find the number of classes Manny can miss, we subtract the number of classes he must attend from the total number of classes:

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add them together.

Time to dig through soil: 
Distance through soil = 24 feet
Rate through soil = 4 feet/hour
Time = Distance / Rate = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay: 
Distance through clay = 8 feet
Rate through clay = 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour (since he digs half as fast through clay)
Time = Distance / Rate = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost was 20 * $20 = $400. She got $2 off, so the final price was $400 - $2 = $398.

On Wednesday, the price per pomegranate was $30, so the total cost for 20 pomegranates was 20 * $30 = $600. There was a 10% discount, so the discount amount was 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. The final price was $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to find the sales from green hats. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

Sales from red hats = 1/2 * Sales from green hats
400 = 1/2 * Sales from green hats
Sales from green hats = 400 * 2
Sales from green hats = 800

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

Total amount she made in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month

"Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. The total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation:

Since each animal has one head, the total number of animal heads is the sum of the number of sheep and geese, which is 20. We can write the equation:
s + g = 20

We can solve these equations by first multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' the same in both equations:
2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate 'g':
(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
2s = 30

Divide both sides by 2:
s = 15

The price of an orange is three times the price of a banana, so it's 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of squares, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares.

Red squares: 14
Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares:
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total number of square feet is equal to the total number of squares.

"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she already has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we need to find out how many chairs are needed in total. There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming babies will use high chairs and adults will use regular chairs, we need at least 15 high chairs and 42 regular chairs.

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 15 - 8 = 7 more high chairs. For regular chairs, she needs 42 - 40 = 2 more regular chairs.

In total, Mia needs 7 + 2 = 9 more chairs."

"To find out how many points the class is missing, we first need to calculate the total points collected by the students.

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. 
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. 
So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
So, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Tom: 35
Marta: 105
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. 
To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the threshold:

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300:
40% of 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to find the total number of people, which is Aiden and his friends. 

Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to see a film, and they meet up with 7 more friends there. So the total number of people is 1 (Aiden) + 12 (his friends) + 7 (more friends) = 20.

Each person has 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So the total number of drinks is 20 * 2 = 40, and the total number of snacks is 20 * 3 = 60.

The total number of items (drinks and snacks) is 40 (drinks) + 60 (snacks) = 100.

Each item costs $2, so the total amount spent is 100 * 2 = 200.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We also know the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. So, we can set up an equation to find the capacity of Gary's truck:

Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity + Gary's capacity = Total capacity
4,000 + 4,800 + Gary's capacity = 11,600

Combine the constants on the left side:
8,800 + Gary's capacity = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides to isolate Gary's capacity:
Gary's capacity = 11,600 - 8,800
Gary's capacity = 2,800

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

The total number of dumplings Larry cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

Speed of cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of turtle = Speed of cat / 5
Speed of turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 * 40
Distance = 120 feet

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to find the amount they raise per hour. 

They raised $2100 in 3 hours. 
Amount raised per hour = $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

Now, we need to find the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300.
Total number of hours = Total amount / Amount raised per hour
Total number of hours = $6300 / $700 per hour
Total number of hours = 9 hours.

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, the additional hours they need to fundraise is:
Additional hours = Total number of hours - Hours already fundraised
Additional hours = 9 hours - 3 hours
Additional hours = 6 hours.

However, the question asks for the total number of hours they have to fundraise to reach their goal, not the additional hours. Therefore, the answer is the total number of hours.

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream separately and then add them together.

Chocolate ice cream: 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour. In 48 hours, the factory can make 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

Vanilla ice cream: 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour. In 48 hours, the factory can make 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

Total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours = 2400 + 600 = 3000.

Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

"To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we need to first determine the number of books Alice has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can find the number of books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2. 
Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now, we know Alice has 6 more books than Steven. 
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's books from Clara's books.
Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 40% of 40.

40% of 40 = 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls per class

Since there are 40 students in each class and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is the difference between the total number of students and the number of girls.

Number of boys per class = Total students per class - Number of girls per class

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. Since each small sticker is worth one small button and a large button is worth three small stickers, 27 small stickers are worth 9 large buttons (27 / 3 = 9). Now she has 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons. Now she has 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers and 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, for a total of 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons. She also has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Since the problem asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons. Now, we add the small buttons: 87 + 60 = 147.

w + o = 17

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had (3 + o) orange fish and (4 + w) white fish. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write another equation:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtract 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

Now, substitute this expression for 'o' into the first equation (w + o = 17):

w + (5 + 2w) = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

w = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and the total amount of gas he uses.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 2 * 5 miles = 10 miles per day.

In a week, Andy drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Given his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the combined fraction of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8. 

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8 in this case. 
So, we convert 1/4 to 2/8 (multiply numerator and denominator by 2) and keep 1/8 as it is.

Now, we add 2/8 and 1/8, which equals 3/8. 

This means 3/8 of the total TVs sold are either smart TVs or analog TVs. 
To find the fraction of OLED TVs sold, we subtract 3/8 from 1 (the total). 
1 can be written as 8/8. 

So, 8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8. 

This means 5/8 of the total TVs sold are OLED TVs. 
Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, we multiply 5/8 by 40 to find the number of OLED TVs sold.

(5/8) * 40 = (5 * 40) / 8 = 200 / 8 = 25

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to at least 32 degrees. 

To find out how many degrees the house needs to be heated, we subtract the temperature at night from the minimum required temperature: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the total degrees needed by the heat provided by each log: 20 / 5 = 4.

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Now, we need to find the total number of seashells brought back by the members of these 6 groups. Since each group has 9 members and each member brought back 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group and then by the number of seashells per member.

6 * 9 * 2 = 108

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then multiply it by the monthly salary.

The company's initial employee number is 200. Since the company hires 20 new employees every month, the total number of employees after three months will be:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) = 220
220 + 20 (new employees in the second month) = 240
240 + 20 (new employees in the third month) = 260

So, the total number of employees after three months is 260.

Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months will be:

260 (total employees) * 4000 (monthly salary) = 1,040,000 per month

Since we need to find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats is x. 
The number of goats will be 30% of x, which is 0.3x.

We know that the number of goats will be the difference between the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats (x) and the current number of stuffed animals (14). 
So, the number of goats = x - 14.

Since the number of goats is 0.3x, we can set up the equation:
0.3x = x - 14

To solve for x, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 14

Now, divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 20

This means the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats should be 20. 
Since she currently has 14 stuffed animals, the number of goats she should buy is:
20 - 14 = 6

Half an hour per day for 14 days is 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. 
2 hours per day for 7 days is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount.

The shipping cost is calculated as follows:
Weight-based cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Distance-based cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund amount is 75% of the book's purchase price:
Refund amount: 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.00

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
Initial cost: $32
Refund amount: -$24.00
Shipping cost: +$3.00
Total loss: $32 - $24.00 + $3.00 = $11.00

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production in the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate this, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to his savings.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30
40% of Anthony's savings = $12

Now, we add this to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30 + $12

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the height that each person can lift relative to Pompei.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 1 * 12 = 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 12 * 4 = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 48 * 10 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it would take one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo would take 3 times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that they will take twice as long as a kangaroo to cross the highway. So, one turtle would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for all four turtles to cross the highway is the same as the time it takes for one turtle. Therefore, it will take four turtles 108 hours to cross the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop, receiving her part-time job pay, and getting help from her mom, then subtract the extra $50 she needs.

The price of the laptop after trading in her old one is $600 - $200 = $400.

She received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount she received is $150 + $80 = $230.

The total amount she has is the amount in her purse (which we are trying to find) + $230.

Since she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the amount in her purse: 
Amount in purse + $230 = $350

Subtracting $230 from both sides of the equation:
Amount in purse = $350 - $230
Amount in purse = $120

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, 3 cows produce 3 * 5 = 15 liters of milk a day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more liters he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we divide the additional liters needed by the production of one cow: 10 / 5 = 2.

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the total length of the glue sticks used and subtract it from the total original length of the three glue sticks.

The original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters. So, the total original length of the three glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters.

Now, let's find the length of the glue sticks used:
- The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has been used 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the glue stick used is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.
- The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has been used 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the glue stick used is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.
- The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has been used 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the glue stick used is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks used is 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

Now, we subtract the total length of the glue sticks used from the total original length to find the total length of the glue sticks not used:

2. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.
3. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store.
4. Jack collected 60 dishes.

From point 3, we know Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Since Jack collected 60 dishes, he must have collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Now, we know Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes.

From point 1, Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

From point 2, Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

The cost of jello is $1.25 per box, so the total cost will be:
12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda, we first need to find the cost of 1 bottle of soda. Since 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can divide $21.00 by 7 to get the cost of 1 bottle of soda.

Cost of 1 bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00

Now, we can multiply the cost of 1 bottle of soda by 3 to get the cost of 3 bottles of soda.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

To find the cost of 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of 1 bottle of water. Since 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, we can divide $8.00 by 4 to get the cost of 1 bottle of water.

Cost of 1 bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00

Now, we can multiply the cost of 1 bottle of water by 2 to get the cost of 2 bottles of water.

Cost of 2 bottles of water = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Finally, we can add the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water to get the total cost.

Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the profit she makes from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the profit Sarah makes from selling the rope:
Profit = Length of rope * Price per meter
Profit = 20 meters * $2/meter
Profit = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:
Cost of new rope = Length of new rope * Price per meter
Since Sarah is using the profit to buy the new rope, the length of the new rope will be determined by the profit. 
Length of new rope = Profit / Price per meter
Length of new rope = $40 / $1.5/meter
Length of new rope = 26.67 meters
Cost of new rope = 26.67 meters * $1.5/meter
Cost of new rope = $40

However, since the cost of the new rope is equal to the profit, we can simply subtract the cost of the new rope from the profit to find the amount of money left over. But in this case, we can also see that the cost of the new rope is equal to the profit, so we can also calculate the length of the new rope that Sarah can buy with the profit and then subtract the cost of 20 meters of the new rope from the profit to find the amount of money left over.

Length of new rope that Sarah can buy with the profit = $40 / $1.5/meter
Length of new rope that Sarah can buy with the profit = 26.67 meters
Cost of 20 meters of the new rope = 20 meters * $1.5/meter
Cost of 20 meters of the new rope = $30
Amount of money left over = Profit - Cost of 20 meters of the new rope
Amount of money left over = $40 - $30
Amount of money left over = $10

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, so we can write an equation:
x + 10 = 18

Now, we solve for 'x':

x = 8

This means Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. 
Thrice her present age is 3x = 3 * 8 = 24.

Let's denote the number of years it will take for her age to be 24 as 'y'. 
We can write an equation:

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since the chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 each, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.

The cost of the apples is half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is $2 x 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

So, Jerry counts 4 birds flying overhead.

Finally, he counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

Given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can substitute this value into the equation:

121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we divide both sides by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins at 5 times the speed of the thingamabob, we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we don't know how much Kamala and Alba paid, let's denote the amount Kamala paid as 'K' and the amount Alba paid as 'A'. 

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts she made from mowing each lawn. Since we don't know the exact amounts, we can express this as 6 + 3Kx + 5Ax.

However, we do know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know that she mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn thrice, and Alba's lawn five times. Since Joe paid $6, let's assume Kamala paid 3 times as much as Joe (3 * 6 = 18) and Alba paid 5 times as much as Joe (5 * 6 = 30). 

Now we can calculate the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns: 6 + 3(18) + 5(30) = 6 + 54 + 150 = 210. However, this is not possible since Tasha only made $80 in total.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn thrice, and Alba's lawn five times. Since Joe paid $6, let's assume Kamala paid the same amount as Joe for each mow (6 * 3 = 18) and Alba paid the same amount as Joe for each mow (6 * 5 = 30). 

Now we can calculate the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns: 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Now we can calculate the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales by subtracting the amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount she made: 80 - 54 = 26.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on the extreme sudoku puzzle and then divide it by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle of water.

First, we find the time taken for the extreme sudoku puzzle: 
Time for a normal sudoku puzzle = 45 minutes
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide the total time by 30 minutes:
180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving the extreme sudoku puzzle.

"To find the number of yellow balloons, let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18. Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons can be found by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3.

y = 18 / 3
y = 6

The number of yellow balloons is 6."
"To find the total miles driven in a month, multiply the miles driven per day by the number of days in the month. 

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, divide the total miles driven by 1000.

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, we add the hours he works each day to find the total hours: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent and then divide it by 2.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) is 12 / 2 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they combined their allowance, the total amount they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2.

$28 / 2 = $14.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of pet:
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat in a day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day. 

The total number of slices they eat in a day is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices they eat in a day (6). 

24 / 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells.

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and will stop at 10 years old. So, she has been collecting shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, Martha has been collecting shells for 5 * 12 = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, she will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we subtract 15 from the total number of cups.

Total cups = 27
Cinnamon tea cups = 15
Chamomile and mint tea cups = Total cups - Cinnamon tea cups
Chamomile and mint tea cups = 27 - 15
Chamomile and mint tea cups = 12

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we divide the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups by 3 and then divide by 2 (since there are two types of tea).

Total cups per row = 12 / 3
Total cups per row = 4
Mint tea cups per row = Total cups per row / 2
Mint tea cups per row = 4 / 2
Mint tea cups per row = 2

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

Since each trip takes 4 hours, the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. To find the least number of berries per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to first determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water

Now, we need to subtract the amount of water emptied from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the amount of water emptied will be:

500 * 6 = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank:

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount he has for the month.

Colby has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50.
He has seen 8 movies on other days at $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56.
He has had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
He has had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8.

Total money spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Colby has $150 for the month, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy that night, he will spend $8 + $2 = $10 on those items.

He will have $20 - $10 = $10 left for a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket will cost $10, which is exactly what he has left.

So, Colby can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total calories of the mini pastries, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so:
600 * 1/3 = 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll

Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls:
200 * 200 = 40,000 calories from the mini cinnamon rolls

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that:
450 * 1/3 = 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin

Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins:
300 * 150 = 45,000 calories from the mini blueberry muffins

Now, add the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:
40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and Jean's (also referred to as John) age as J.

We know that P + L + J = 100 (the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old).

We also know that L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John).

We are also given that P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age).

We can substitute L = J + 10 into the equation P = L + J to get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Now, we can substitute P = 2J + 10 and L = J + 10 into the equation P + L + J = 100 to get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know J, we can find L: L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Now that we know J and L, we can find P: P = L + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

Maria's friends had 2 balloons each initially, and there were 4 friends, so they had 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. 
Maria had 1 balloon initially. 
So, the total number of balloons initially was 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There were 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so they received 5 * 3 = 15 more balloons.

The total number of balloons is 9 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 24.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the total number of tables needed.

Total tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already own 15 tables, we subtract this from the total number of tables needed to find the number of new tables they need.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

In 24 hours, it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.
In 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. 
In 24 hours, it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.
In 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
The cost for a 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos. 
Cameron stays for 17 hours, so he needs to pay for 5 additional hours (17 - 12 = 5).
The cost for the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the second option from the cost of the first option:

"To find the amount of hay each sheep needs, we first need to find twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than that, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds, so the total amount of hay needed for the goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds, so the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the amount needed for the goats and the amount needed for the sheep. So, the total amount of hay needed is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. 
Family emails = 2/3 * 9 = 6

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after removing the family emails. 
Remaining emails = Non-work emails - Family emails = 9 - 6 = 3

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. 
Boyfriend emails = 1/3 * 3 = 1

"To find Shawna's father's age, we need to first find Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate his age as follows:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of 48 and subtract it from 48.

20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

38.4 ≈ 38

The number of people who really attended the concert is approximately 38."
"To find the total number of balls, we need to determine how many balls each boy carried. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Now, we can add up the number of balls each boy carried to find the total number of balls: 
Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

Total number of balls: 7"
"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the third day, and then the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

The total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, the number of Pokémon caught by Stan is 4x - 13.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon caught by Alex is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. So, we can write the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan:

Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

Stan's Pokémon: 147"

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment and then find the net distance.

Distance = Rate * Time

1. Distance traveled south in the first segment: 
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

2. Distance traveled north in the second segment: 
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance will be subtracted from the total distance traveled south.

3. Distance traveled south in the third segment: 
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, let's find the net distance:
Net distance = Distance traveled south in the first segment - Distance traveled north in the second segment + Distance traveled south in the third segment
Net distance = 300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, so we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from his age. 
25% of 8 is 0.25 * 8 = 2 years.
So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can calculate the total age of all three family members:
Nani's age: 8 years
Nani's brother's age: 16 years
Nani's sister's age: 6 years
Total age: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine the total number of oranges she had and then subtract the number of oranges she gave away and kept.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she had is:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of:
2 boxes * 2 people = 4 boxes
4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, subtract the oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges:
240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges:
1/4 * 160 oranges = 40 oranges

Now, subtract the oranges she kept from the remaining oranges to find out how many she sold:

We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together. 

So, Jerry has 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. 

So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days, and then multiply those numbers by their respective costs.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days:
Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

Let's denote Emil's dad's age as D and his brother's age as B.

When Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be D + 5 (since 24 - 19 = 5 years from now), and his brother's age will be B + 5.

According to the given information:
- Emil's age at 24 will be half of his dad's age at that time: 24 = (D + 5)/2
- Emil's age at 24 will be twice his brother's age at that time: 24 = 2(B + 5)

Solving the first equation for D:
24 = (D + 5)/2
48 = D + 5
D = 43

Solving the second equation for B:
24 = 2(B + 5)
12 = B + 5
B = 7

Now, we have the ages of Emil's dad and brother 5 years from now. To find their current ages, we subtract 5:
- Dad's current age: 43 - 5 = 38
- Brother's current age: 7 - 5 = 2

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 38 + 2 = 40.

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches/foot.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we need to find the total space each plant will occupy, including the space between plants. Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there is 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between plants. 

12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space) = 30 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant occupies.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the flower bed is full. However, in this case, we will round down to 44 plants because we can't buy a fraction of a plant and we will have 17 plants already.

Now, subtract the 17 plants Pat already owns from the total number of plants needed.

First, let's calculate the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, we can multiply the time it takes her to sauté 30 shrimp by 3 (since 90 is 3 times 30):

H = 2 * (20 / 4)
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it into the first equation:

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of all the slices, which is 8x.

Now, we can find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing the size of each adult's slice (2x) by the total size of the watermelon (8x) and multiplying by 100:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find the total time spent on rounds, we multiply the time per inpatient (20 minutes) by the number of inpatients (9). 
9 * 20 = 180 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
180 / 60 = 3 hours

To find the total time spent on appointments, we multiply the time per appointment (30 minutes) by the number of appointments (10).
10 * 30 = 300 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60.
300 / 60 = 5 hours

Now, we add the time spent at the clinic (9 hours), the time spent on rounds (3 hours), and the time spent on appointments (5 hours) to find the total time spent.
However, the time spent at the clinic is the total available time, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the time spent at the clinic.
9 - 3 - 5 = 1

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake and then subtract that from the serving time.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of chocolate bars in a box is x.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars.

We can set up the equation: 3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms: 8x = 64

Divide both sides by 8: x = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost per session and then multiply it by the number of sessions per month.

The cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 (per student) * 10 (number of students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total number of sessions per month is 3 * 4 (weeks in a month) = 12 sessions per month.

The total expected earnings per month is $40 (cost per session) * 12 (sessions per month) = $480.

"To find out how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each of them has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we need to calculate the total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

"To find the initial charge of the power bank, we need to work backwards. 

First, let's calculate the charge remaining after 3 hours of losing 7% capacity per hour. If the charge remaining in the end was 28%, we can set up an equation to find the charge before the 3 hours of 7% loss:

Let x be the charge before the 3 hours of 7% loss.
x - 3 * (7% of x) = 28%
x - 0.21x = 28%
0.79x = 28%
x = 28% / 0.79
x = 35.44%

Now, we know the charge before the 3 hours of 7% loss was 35.44%. This charge was the result of 5 hours of losing 9% capacity per hour. Let's set up another equation to find the initial charge:

Let y be the initial charge.
y - 5 * (9% of y) = 35.44%
y - 0.45y = 35.44%
0.55y = 35.44%

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation to get the total earnings as 12L + 4(2L) = 12L + 8L = 20L.

We know that the total earnings are $120, so we can set up the equation 20L = 120. Solving for L, we get L = 120 / 20 = 6.

Since S = 2L, the number of small stuffed animals sold is S = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day to find the total:
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Total amount lost = $5 (lost) - $11 (won) + $16.50 (lost) = $10.50.

Since there were 3 races, the average amount lost is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so the sum of the shares of the three people is equal to 1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Since the team worked 3/8 of a day each day, the total hours worked by the team in 21 days is:
21 days * (3/8) * 24 hours/day = 21 * 3 * 3 hours = 189 hours.

Now, divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters:
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

Combine like terms:
2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over 3 years (from 2007 to 2010). 

The formula for exponential decay is:

Given values are:
P = $20000 (initial price)
r = 21% or 0.21 (rate of decay)
t = 3 years

Plugging in the values, we get:
A = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
A = 20000 * (0.79)^3
A = 20000 * 0.493039
A ≈ 9867.80

Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt.

Given the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required by dividing the total area by the area of each tile:

Total tiles required = Total area / Area of each tile
Total tiles required = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total tiles required = 200

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles required by the cost of each tile:

Total cost = Total tiles required * Cost of each tile

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. 15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so the number of BMX bikes is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. The rest of the bikes were MTB type, so the number of MTB bikes is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB ($500 / 2 = $250), and a Trekking bike is $450. Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250"
"To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the difference between the number of bales made by the farmer and the number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The number of bales left in the field is the difference between the number of bales made and the number of bales picked up: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in class and the extra learning time on weekends.

1. Time spent in class per day: 
   6 periods (normal) + 2 extra periods = 8 periods
   Each period is 40 minutes long, so time spent in class per day = 8 * 40 = 320 minutes

2. Time spent in class per week:
   Time spent in class per day = 320 minutes
   Time spent in class per week = 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes

3. Extra learning time on weekends:
   John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on each Saturday and Sunday.
   Total weekly minutes = 60 * 24 * 7 = 10080 minutes
   Extra learning time per weekend day = (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes
   Total extra learning time per week = 630 * 2 = 1260 minutes

4. Total time spent learning per week:
   Time spent in class per week = 1600 minutes
   Total extra learning time per week = 1260 minutes
   Total time spent learning per week = 1600 + 1260 = 2860 minutes

5. Convert total time spent learning per week to hours:
   Total time spent learning per week = 2860 minutes
   Total time spent learning per week in hours = 2860 / 60 = 47.67 hours

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child:
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child:
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To find the total earnings, we need to first find the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. So, the velociraptors left 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex left 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of 12 gallons of paint is 12 * $12 = $144.

"To find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas, with 3 still shaken. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas, with 2 still shaken.

Now, the probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of remaining sodas
= 2 / 8
= 0.25

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Probability (percentage) = 0.25 * 100

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

Total distance = 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the number of days Billy helps people, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days. So the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

So, Billy helps people for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people he helps is 6 * 40 = 240.

"To find the total time of lunches and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks. 

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
2 15-minute breaks add up to 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 
So, the total time for lunch and breaks per day is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time for lunch and breaks per day is 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

To find the total time after 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we'll need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we'll assume she wants to save enough to cover her desired annual retirement income for 20 years. We'll also assume a 0% return on investment for simplicity.

Retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Now, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of every paycheck and her annual salary is $100,000, we can calculate her annual savings as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

To determine how many years Lauren needs to work to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide her retirement savings goal by her annual savings:

Number of years to reach goal = Retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we'll assume she's been working for some time. However, to provide a numerical answer, we'll assume she's just starting her career. Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is 40 years.

However, the question asks for how many more years she needs to work. Since we don't know how long she's been working, we can't provide an exact answer. But if we assume she's just starting her career, the answer would be:

Total miles to be hiked = 9,300 miles
Total days available = 30 days

Miles to be hiked per day = Total miles / Total days
Miles to be hiked per day = 9,300 miles / 30 days
Miles to be hiked per day = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is planning to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, the total miles she plans to hike per day is:
125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we subtract the planned miles per day from the required miles per day:

"Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

Additionally, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

We can substitute C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30 to solve for S:
(S + 12) + S = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

We also know that the total number of eggs painted is 56, so A + M + C + S = 56.
Since A = M, we can rewrite this as 2A + C + S = 56.
Substitute C = 21 and S = 9:
2A + 21 + 9 = 56
Combine like terms:
2A + 30 = 56
Subtract 30 from both sides:
2A = 26
Divide both sides by 2:
A = 13

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and the number of eggs Arnold painted:
C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

"To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately and then add them together.

Weight of crayons: 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces
Weight of boxes: Since Nik has 200 crayons and he puts them into groups of 8, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. 
Weight of boxes: 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Total weight in ounces: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, we find out how much of the tree can be used to make logs: 
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price of each plank to find the total amount John makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

Time spent on the beach = Distance / Speed
Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes (given)
2 / x = 40 / 60 (converting 40 minutes to hours)
x = 3 miles / hour

Now, we know the speed on the beach is 3 miles per hour. The speed on the sidewalk is twice that, which is 6 miles per hour.

Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (6 miles / 60 minutes) = 1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute) = 10 minutes

Total time spent on the walk = Time spent on the beach + Time spent on the sidewalk
Total time spent on the walk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is:
$4 * 8 = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week:
$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the temperature of the second mug. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as 'x'. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the total amount of water becomes 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total heat of the mixture is the sum of the heat of the two components. 

(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees) = 5 ounces * 40 degrees

Now, let's solve for x:

132 + x = 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x = 68

Number of chickens added per day: 10
Number of days in three weeks: 21

Total cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Total chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Total number of animals after three weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount.

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

The 10% discount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

Now, we can find the cost of each single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

It takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. 
Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
So, Gomer ate 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will eat in 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester will eat in 60 days is:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14.

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84, so we can set up a proportion to find the number of women:

9/14 = x/84

Cross-multiplying, we get:
9 * 84 = 14x
756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14
x = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus initially.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women who remained on the bus is:

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per sunflower:

$26 ÷ $2 = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:

13 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can divide the total earnings by the cost per bouquet:

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets per day is:

7 bouquets/day × 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets is:

84 sunflowers/day × 3 days = 252 sunflowers

Now, we can add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:

39 sunflowers + 252 sunflowers = 291 sunflowers

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -$3

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
   Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home.
   The number of 20 dollar bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   Half of 40 is 40 / 2 = 20. 
   The number of 20 dollar bills remaining is 40 - 20 = 20.

4. The total amount of money Thomas has is 20 * 20 = $400.

5. Thomas then triples his money.
   The new amount of money Thomas has is 400 * 3 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.
   The number of 5 dollar bills is 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch of chalk per day.

However, since the teacher only has 2.75 inches of chalk left, we need to calculate how many days this will last. 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk and recycles it when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to get to 2 inches.

If the teacher uses 1 inch of chalk per day, and he has 2.75 inches left, he will use 0.75 inches on the third day. 
2.75 - 0.75 = 2 inches.

So, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the 3rd day.

The teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk, and then he will have to recycle it on the 3rd day.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had the bandages they already had plus the 100 new bandages minus the 25 used, which equals 78. 

Let's call the number of bandages they had at the start of the third day 'x'. Then, x + 100 - 25 = 78. Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 100 + 25 = 3.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, at the end of the second day, they had the bandages they had at the start of the second day minus the 28 used. Since they had 3 bandages at the start of the third day and they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages on the first day, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the end of the first day.

Now, let's call the number of bandages they started with on the first day 'y'. Then, y - 38 + 50 = 31. Solving for y, we get y = 31 - 50 + 38 = 19.

For the first 5 years, the cost per visit is $2. Since Pauline visits 3 times a year, the annual cost is 2 * 3 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of $2, which is 2 * (150/100) = $3. Then, we add this to the original cost: $2 + $3 = $5. The new annual cost for Pauline is 5 * 3 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find the total number of students participating, we need to multiply the number of grades by the number of students per grade. 

There are 4 grades (4-7) and 10 students per grade. 
Total students = 4 * 10 = 40 students

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups.
Number of groups = 40 / 8 = 5 groups

Each group uses 45 minutes, so we multiply the number of groups by the time per group to find the total time.
Total time = 5 * 45 = 225 minutes

The answer is: 225"

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and after the cut, it will be divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x), we can find the length of the longer piece (4x):

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will use. 

Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total pounds of meat = Total meatballs / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat = 5

Now that we know Aiden will use 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he will need. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total seasoning = Total pounds of meat * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning = 5 * 2
Total seasoning = 10

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

b = 3c - 2

Since each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write:

c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost, first, calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to first find out how many paintings Shelley has. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the equation:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = Shelley's paintings - 12

To find Shelley's paintings, we add 12 to both sides of the equation:

Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, and Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, we can set up another equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = Kim's paintings + 8

To find Kim's paintings, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of popped kernels:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

"To make 4 gallons of regular lemonade, Tim will need 4 cups of lemon juice (1 cup per gallon). Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need 4 * 6 = 24 lemons for the regular lemonade.

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, he will need 2 cups of lemon juice (twice the amount of 1 cup per gallon). Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need 2 * 6 = 12 lemons for the extra gallon.

In total, Tim will need 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to determine the number of yellow blocks. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we know the total number of blocks in the tower is 32. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of blocks:

Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks + Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks
4 + 8 + Number of red blocks = 32

Combine the constants on the left side:
12 + Number of red blocks = 32

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the number of red blocks:
Number of red blocks = 32 - 12
Number of red blocks = 20

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to find the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies. 

There are 54 red candies. 
There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies. 
There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189 candies.

Since the bag has 232 pieces of candies in total, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow) = 43.

Line needed to buy = 600 - 6
Line needed to buy = 594

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total cost of the meals and wine for each reservation. 

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. 
Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount they make per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount they make a week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to find the cost price of each watermelon and then calculate the selling price.

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Profit percentage = 25%
Profit on each watermelon = 25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Selling price of each watermelon = Cost price + Profit = $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine his current age. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had James when he was 19 years old, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges in an hour.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. So, Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges in an hour.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5.

"To find the cost of the radiator at 80% off, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320
Discount = $320
Price at junk shop = Original price - Discount = $400 - $320 = $80

The cost of the mechanic's labor is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Total cost = Price at junk shop + Labor cost = $80 + $150 = $230

"Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. Since there are 20 animals in total, we can write the equation:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

2c + 4w = 70

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). To share the slices equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

Answer: 14"
