"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Number of eggs laid per day: 16
Number of eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
Number of eggs used for baking muffins: 4
Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7
Number of eggs sold: 16 - 7 = 9

Price per egg: $2
Total amount made per day: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, this is the value of the house before repairs. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

The selling price of the house is $200,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to find out the total amount of feed needed for the day. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total amount of feed needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide them into pairs (first and second glass). There will be 8 pairs of glasses.

The cost of each pair is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

The cost of 8 pairs is 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to find the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download 200 GB is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he was in standstill traffic, so he didn't move.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drove at 30 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drove at 80 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

However, we also need to consider the distance he traveled before turning around. He drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). 

The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons (7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year).

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63

Since the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108) in year 6, we need to calculate for year 7 and year 8.

Year 7: Total cost = $108 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $111, Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5
Year 8: Total cost = $111 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $114, Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84
Year 9: Total cost = $114 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $117, Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5
Year 10: Total cost = $117 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $120, Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105
Year 11: Total cost = $120 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $123, Total revenue = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5
Year 12: Total cost = $123 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $126, Total revenue = $10.5 * 12 = $126

However, in year 12, the total revenue ($126) is still not more than the total cost ($126). We need to calculate for year 13.

Year 13: Total cost = $126 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $129, Total revenue = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5

In year 13, the total revenue ($136.5) is more than the total cost ($129). Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She sold 2 more to the red house. 
Then she sold half of what was left at the orange house. 

The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is x - x/3 = 2x/3. 
The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is 2x/3 - 2. 
The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
x/3 - 1 = 5

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides:
x/3 = 6

Then we multiply both sides by 3:
x = 18

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching.

As a teacher, she earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:

As a coach, she earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Her total annual salary is the sum of her earnings from teaching and coaching:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To find the total number of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to find out how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Now, to find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs). 
84 / 12 = 7.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. She has 6 miles left to walk.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend the money from all 13 lego sets. The amount he didn't spend is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel in 2 hours while running is 2 * 6 = 12 miles.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the time it takes to write an article (4 hours).

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number she had initially and the number she had remaining.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so she had (80 + x) - 220 Post-it notes remaining.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, so we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to find the number of blue ties and the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, the number of blue ties is 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of a red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is 200 + 600 = $800.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. This means she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. 

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know the car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find the total miles Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the mpg by the total capacity of the tank.

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to find the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of pet dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes (since 64 / 2 = 32).

Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16 to get the number of cans: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to get the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. 

90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using a variable to represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Let's call this number x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, the number of cookies he meant to bake this year is 2x.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

He then drops 5 cookies, so the total number of cookies he has left is (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are told that this number is equal to 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 50

So Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Cashback amount = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
Cashback amount = $0.20 * 10

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many feet Julia rowed to reach the shore and then divide that by 10 to find out how many 10-foot intervals she rowed. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how many feet she rows per second by dividing 20 feet by 16 seconds. 

20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can multiply the time by the speed to find the total distance.

1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now we can divide the total distance by 10 to find the number of 10-foot intervals.

80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals

Since the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can multiply the number of intervals by 2 to find the total amount of water.

8 intervals * 2 liters/interval = 16 liters

1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone
Brittany's phone = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone = 300

Now, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. 
Let's denote the number of birds as x.
Brittany's phone = 50 * x

"To find the profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

Cost price of 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards = 10 * $10 = $100
Cost price of 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards = 5 * $16 = $80
Total cost price = $100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.

Selling price of 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards = 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150
Selling price of 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards = 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120
Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

Since there are twice as many babies as queens, B = 2Q.

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, W = 2B.

We also know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q into the equation, we get:
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
Combine like terms:
7Q = 700
Divide by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W:
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200
W = 2B = 2(200) = 400

The number of worker bees is 400.

"To find the total expenses, we need to calculate the cost of supplies for all 8 clients (3 current and 5 potential). 

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, so the cost of bleach per client is 2 * $2 = $4. 
Each client also needs a pack of cloths at $5. 
The total cost per client is $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9. 
For 8 clients, the total cost is 8 * $9 = $72.

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income: 
Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses 
Profit = $92 - $72 
Profit = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"To find the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to break down the information given.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees returned, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours left the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. At this point, the total number of bees that left the hive and hadn't returned is 30 (from the first 6 hours) - 15 (that returned) + 60 (that left in the next 6 hours) = 75 bees.
5. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before and hadn't already returned came back to the hive, which is 75 bees.

The number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 75."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.
The total cost of the tickets is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost of the tickets to find out how much she gave the cashier.

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:
James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find out how long the winner will be waiting, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find the total amount Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

- 5 people with bicycles had 2 tires each inflated, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
- 3 people with tricycles had 3 tires each inflated, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
- 1 person with a unicycle had 1 tire inflated.

Total tires inflated = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Cost per tire is 25 cents, so the total amount made is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"Let's denote the original number of french fries as x.

Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining number of fries is x - 14.

The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining number of fries is x - 14 - 7 = x - 21.

The three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. The remaining number of fries is x - 21 - 9 = x - 30.

The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so the number of fries the raccoon stole is 2/3 * (x - 30). The remaining number of fries is 1/3 * (x - 30).

The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, 1/3 * (x - 30) = 5 + 1 = 6.

Now, we can solve for x:
1/3 * (x - 30) = 6
x - 30 = 6 * 3
x - 30 = 18
x = 18 + 30
x = 48

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the hours spent per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, the total hours for these days are 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, the total hours for these days are 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Total hours per week = 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours spent attending classes in a semester = 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the number of votes the winner got. 

The winner got 3/4 of the votes, and the total number of students who voted was 80. 

So, the number of votes the winner got is 3/4 * 80 = 60.

Since there are only two candidates, the number of votes the loser got is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner got. 

So, the number of votes the loser got is 80 - 60 = 20.

"To find the number of red roses Sandra ordered, we first need to find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Then the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. 

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. The number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. 

Number of red roses = 4x

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From statement 2, two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14. Mark was 5 years older than that, so Mark's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19.

Since that was two years ago, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

From statement 1, Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team and then find the difference.

The well-rounded team has all members running at 55 seconds each. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running at 60 seconds, the second runner at 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner at 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner at 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time taken by this team is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of favorable outcomes. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we first need to determine the probability of rolling an even number. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. 

The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. Since the die is rolled twice, we need to multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed in total, and 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by subtracting the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and the hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

We know that there are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5.

The selling price per bag is $30.

The profit per bag is the selling price minus the total cost per bag: $30 - $22 = $8.

The total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net gain is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year. After 10 years, he has planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees and chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees. The net gain is 100 - 20 = 80 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom has 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees. 

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

The amount spent in the first year is $15,000.

The amount spent in the second year is one-third of the amount spent in the first year, which is:
$15,000 / 3 = $5,000

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is:
$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours, so his total cost is:
$30/hour * 3 hours = $90

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours, so his total cost is:
$18/hour * 5 hours = $90

Now, we add the costs together to find the total:
$90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus and the number of days for the return trip by car.

The trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days.

Since it takes half as many days to travel by car, the return trip will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (to Rochester by bus) + 3 (return by car) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to find the total number of cards and the number of water type cards after the changes.

Initially, James had 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

New total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Now, the probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards.
Probability = 32 / 96 ≈ 0.3333

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100.
Percentage chance = 0.3333 * 100 ≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To find out how many hours it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to first find out how many minutes it will take. 

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute. 

Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. 

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, it will take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons that were ready at each stage and subtract them from the total.

Initially, 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. 
3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, Ashlyn harvested 63 more watermelons, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so for 12 cars, it's 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate his weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, his weekly consumption is:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. So, their combined weekly consumption is:

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines

So, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their combined weekly consumption.

"To find out how many more candies John has than James, we need to first find out how many candies Robert and James have.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, we can find out how many more candies John has than James by subtracting James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

"To find the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that to hours.

Mike is pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people. 
Each person sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind, so he writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. 
Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week. 
He also receives 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long, so he reads 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week, but we are only concerned with the pages he writes.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes. 
To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to work backwards. 

Griffin started with 24 fries. 
Kyle took 5, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left. 
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. 
Now Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left. 
Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 
Now Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left. 
Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

"To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we need to first find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. 

The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the equation: 
2 * (number of fish in each aquarium) * 2 = 28 (since there are 2 aquariums with the same number of fish)

Combine like terms and solve for the number of fish in each aquarium:
4 * (number of fish in each aquarium) = 28
number of fish in each aquarium = 28 / 4
number of fish in each aquarium = 7

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to find out how many cookies each of them ate.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies each of them ate:
Sue's sister: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by each of them are:

Since there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys and girls is 60 / 2 = 30 each.

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since there are 30 girls in the school, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed x cougars. Then, he killed 3x wolves. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

So, today Rick killed 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls (not 10, as the problem states 20 stalls in the second part). So, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the weight after the termites ate 30% of the tree.

"To find the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

Total weight of flagstones = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight of flagstones = 80 * 75
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and 3 trucks can only carry 3 * 2000 = 6000 pounds, which is exactly the weight of the flagstones, the answer is:

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane and then use the formula time = distance / speed.

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour. So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance of 480 miles.

time = distance / speed
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
time = 16 hours

"To find the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to first find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars and then subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars will be shared equally among them. So, each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we subtract that from the total time: 
3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 10: 
150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval: 
15 * $5 = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to calculate the points for each player first.

Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike and Tony have over 20 points, so they each get 1 extra point. Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points for each player after the extra points have been distributed:
Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
Jim: 18 points (no change)
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

The total points for all three players after the extra points have been distributed is: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

"To find the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus given to the driver per year.

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 60 miles
Total miles driven per week = 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
Total miles driven per year = 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

Total cost per year for miles driven = 15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000
Total bonus per year = $150 per month * 12 months = $1,800

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them up as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a straightforward manner. But in this case, the pages are arranged in a specific way, with page 1 on the left back and page 32 on the right back. This arrangement implies that the pages are paired in a way that requires 8 pieces of paper for the front and 8 pieces of paper for the back, but these are the same 8 pieces of paper, just viewed from different sides.

So, the correct calculation is:

Number of pieces of paper = 8 (for the front and back)

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to find out how many books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, so she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300$.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours per week. 
He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500 per week.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. 
There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so Watson's total earnings from his hourly wage are $500 * 4 = $2000. 
His total bonus for the month is $300 * 4 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings for the month are $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so in a week, he loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks (8 pounds), we need to divide the total weight by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, to lose 8 pounds, it will take her 8 / 2 * 4 = 16 weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of players on each team. 

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. 
Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. 
Since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so we can set up the equation:
15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time spent.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, the total number of hours she spends running the stand is: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu as follows:

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * Number of messages to Ms. Thompson
= 1/3 * 66
= 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages:

Total number of messages = Number of messages to Ms. Thompson + Number of messages to Mr. Yu
= 66 + 22

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to find the total parts in the ratio and divide the total number of popsicles by the total parts.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, so the total parts is 5 + 6 = 11.

Now, we divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of 1 part: 
165 / 11 = 15.

Since Betty has 5 parts, she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.

Since Sam has 6 parts, he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30.
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600.
The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he made from selling his cards. Since he spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, he must have made $150.

We know that he sold his cards for $1.5 each, so we can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find the number of cards he sold:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, this is the number of cards he sold, not the number he started with. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100, so we can solve for x:

2/3x = 100
x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To determine the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs requested.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who could have two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests. So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 + 18 = 54.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26. 

Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is short one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

   - Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
   - 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Apply the 20% discount:
   Discount amount: 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to first find out how many gallons were in each container, then find 1/4 of that amount, and finally convert it to pints.

There were 15 gallons of gas divided into 5 containers. 
15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container.

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which is 1/4 * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, 
0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to first determine how much money he spent on chips and then subtract that from the total amount he spent.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips.

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of $5. To find 99% of $5, we multiply $5 by 0.99, which is $4.95. We convert this to cents: $4.95 x 100 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on chips (120 cents) from the total amount spent (495 cents): 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the remaining amount spent (375 cents) by the cost of a candy bar (75 cents): 375 / 75 = 5.

George bought 5 candy bars."

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake. 

First, we need to find the weight of each piece. Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces, we divide the total weight by the number of pieces:

20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces in total. The weight of the eaten cake is:

2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the eaten cake from the total weight:

20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 
Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Since they are sharing the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8 people.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges everyone will get.
Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7.

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

The difference in their travel times is 16 - 4 = 12 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 12 + 5 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to know the length and width of the room in feet. We are given the length in yards, so we need to convert it to feet first. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We are also given the area of the room, which is 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads, for a total of 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.

Since each pack contains 20 beads, we multiply the number of packs by 20 to find the total number of beads:
Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.
Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number:

- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
- 10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
- 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' time for the run:
- James' total time: 180 minutes
- James' swim and bike time: 36 + 85 = 121 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is, we need to first convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. 

The shark is 10 feet long, which is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 inches. 

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiplying by 100:

(12 / 120) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to determine what fraction of the students do not have desktop computers and then use that information to calculate the total.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, and this represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's represent the total number of students as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to break in the shoes and then divide the total walking time by that number.

Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes. Since he can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he has is:
3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Now, we divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the total number of days (12):
240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

"To find out how many books Sarah bought, we need to divide the total amount she spent ($300) by the cost of each book ($15).

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we need to divide the total number of books by 4.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.2 * $1500 = $300.
So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.
For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the cost of the plane tickets plus the cost of the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, Uncle Ben needs 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 8 razors. 

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor:

$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

We also know that D = B/2 (David found half of what Bodhi found).
We are also given that L + D + B = 43 (Together they collected 43 insects).

Substituting D = B/2 into L = D + 7, we get L = B/2 + 7.

Now, we can substitute L and D in terms of B into the equation L + D + B = 43:
(B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

Combine like terms:
2B/2 + 7 = 43
B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
B = 36

Now that we know B, we can find D:
D = B/2
D = 36/2
D = 18

Now that we know D, we can find L:

36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.

For the blue tulips, Jackson can fit 8 tulips in a row. He buys 24 blue tulips. To find the number of rows, we divide the total number of tulips by the number of tulips per row:
24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
6 rows (red) + 3 rows (blue) = 9 rows.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she will use for the cookies. Since she is dividing the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will use 1/3 of the raisins for the cookies.

1/3 of 27 cups is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we can divide 9 by 3/4.

9 / (3/4) = 9 * 4 / 3 = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts/hour
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts/hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh):
Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:
Weekly cost before: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly cost after: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:
$3528 - $3024 = $504

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since painting a whole house is twice as much work as painting half a house).

2. If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then one person can paint a whole house in 10 * 24 = 240 hours (since there are 24 hours in a day).

3. If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 / 5 = 48 hours (since 5 people can do the same amount of work in 1/5 the time).

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first find the number of chairs each person has.

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost. 

The total cost of the CD and the headphone set is $48. The cost of the CD is $4. 

So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. 

Since each CD costs $4, we can divide $44 by $4 to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought: $44 / $4 = 11.

So, Tom could have bought 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphone set. Since he already bought 1 CD, he could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the usual 4 hours, the weeks with 5 hours, and the week with 6 hours.

Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks (since 2 weeks were 5 hours and 1 week was 6 hours). 
So, the total hours spent in those 5 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

For the 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, the total hours spent is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

For the week where he spent 6 hours, the total hours spent is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, we add up the hours spent in all the weeks: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

Total hours spent working out: 36"
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to calculate step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

On the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus. Now the total number of passengers is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

On the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus. Now the total number of passengers is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

The number of passengers after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22.

2. In 8 years, Jame's age will be 22 + 8 = 30.

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60. So, Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

4. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47.

5. The difference in their current ages is 47 - 22 = 25.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. The total cost of the computer and printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

To find the cost of 2 monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first find the total number of seashells brought by the boys and the girls.

Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 x 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 x 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 3000 / 10 = 300.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to find out how much he needs to save each day in the first half.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

Let's assume Elvis saves 'x' dollars per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. The total savings should be equal to his target of $1125.

Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
1125 = 15x + 15(2x)

Combine like terms:
1125 = 15x + 30x
1125 = 45x

Now, divide both sides by 45:
x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day in the second half.

"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

However, the question asks about a hot day, not a warm day. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we will assume that the time for warm water is the same as the time for hot water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes. So, 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he can buy with his money.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, he can buy $10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day for 4 days. The total number of wooden action figures he can buy is 2 * 4 = 8.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, he can buy $10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day for 3 days. The total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 5 * 3 = 15.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

The total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Ford grows 40 roses per week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, let's subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature: 450
Actual temperature: 468
Difference: 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set her oven to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees, given that it's off by 4%.

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know that the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520

To find 4% of x, multiply x by 0.04:
x + 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:
1.04x = 520

Divide both sides by 1.04:
x = 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the total time for the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, the total time for the first movie is:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the hours to minutes:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, the total time for the second movie is:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time for both movies:

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils:

Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts and then divide it by the total number of contacts.

1 box of contacts costs $100.00, but it's 10% off, so the discount is $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00. 
The cost of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.
The cost of 2 boxes is $90.00 * 2 = $180.00.

Since 1 box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes will contain 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Now, we can calculate the cost of each pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost of each pair of contacts is:
$1.00 * 2 = $2.00

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories she burns and then divide that by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie increments she burned. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories doing aerobics.

She spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, we divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie increments she burned. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, she needs to drink 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Since the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B. The jar also contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now we can find the number of red jelly beans (0.99B) and the number of green jelly beans (1.01B):

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't consume any meat.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used and multiply it by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7.

"To find James' commission, we need to calculate the profit made by the company on each car and then find the total profit. 

The selling price of each car is $25,000. 
The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars, so the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

The profit on each car is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to find 5% of his current salary and add it to his current salary.

5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Since the bonus is half a month's salary, the bonus will be:
Bonus = $21,000 / 2 = $10,500

Total monthly income (including bonus) for 12 months would be:
$21,000 * 12 = $252,000
However, the bonus is only given once, so we need to subtract 11 months of the bonus from the total.
$252,000 - (11 * $10,500) = $252,000 - $115,500 = $136,500 + $10,500 = $147,000

Alternatively, we can calculate the total income as:
$21,000 * 12 = $252,000
Bonus for the year = $10,500
Total income for the year = $252,000 - $10,500 + $10,500 = $252,000 

However, the correct way to calculate this is

4S + 2G = 70

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads can be represented as:
S + G = 20

We can solve these equations by first multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G the same:
2S + 2G = 40

Now, subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:
(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:
S = 15

The number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and add the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 
20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1.
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 days. He uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so he buys 7 pounds of coffee.
The cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"To find the total number of hours John spends in the class, we multiply the number of times the class meets per week, the number of hours per class, and the number of weeks.

Number of hours per week: 4 times/week * 2 hours/time = 8 hours/week
Total hours: 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Since John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, we divide the total hours by 1.5 to find the number of recipes he learns.

Number of recipes: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we first need to determine the total number of good days in the first 30 days. We know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.

We also know that her first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days plus the next 3 days is 12 (initial good days) + 2 (additional good days) = 14.

However, we are asked about the good days left in the month after the first 30 days. Since we already know the total good days in the first 30 days (12), we subtract the good days in the first 30 days from the total good days including the next 3 days. But we actually need to subtract the good days in the first 30 days from the good days in the first 30 days plus the next 3 days, and then subtract the good days in the first 30 days from that result. 

So, the good days left in the month are 14 (total good days including the next 3 days) - 12 (initial good days) = 2."

Now, we need to find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches).

600 - 240 = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days.

Initially, James had 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means the number of dogs doubled. So, the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.

However, 3 dogs left, so we subtract 3 from the total number of dogs: 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 1.5 times the original length (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 times the original). 

So, the length after extension is 1.5x. 

She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length is 140cm. So, we can set up the equation:

"Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation:

T = t + 7

We know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation:

2T + 3t = 44

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

2(t + 7) + 3t = 44

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

2t + 14 + 3t = 44

Combine like terms:

5t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

5t = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

t = 6

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin:

T = t + 7
T = 6 + 7

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation:
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

"To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we need to calculate how many sets of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free) she can afford with $6.00.

Each set of 3 scoops costs 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. 

Now, let's divide the total amount Erin has ($6.00) by the cost of each set ($3.00): 
$6.00 / $3.00 = 2 sets.

Since each set has 3 scoops, Erin can buy 2 sets * 3 scoops = 6 scoops.

However, she can only pay for 2 sets of 2 scoops (4 scoops) with $6.00. The 2 free scoops are included in the 6 scoops. 

So, Erin can buy 4 scoops and get 2 scoops free.

When her arms are raised, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot. Since she does this for 2 minutes, the total taps with arms raised is:
2 minutes * 200 taps/minute * 2 feet = 800 taps

When her arms are at her sides, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps with arms at her sides is:
3 minutes * (300 taps/minute + 250 taps/minute) = 3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

The combined total number of taps is the sum of the taps with arms raised and the taps with arms at her sides:

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, let's use the given information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. 

Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x. Then, the equation becomes:

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for 9 large buttons (since 3 small stickers = 1 large button).

3. Now she has 3 small stickers left and 9 large buttons.

4. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. Now she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 20 large stickers left.

6. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

7. Now she has 3 small stickers, 29 large buttons, and 60 small buttons.

8. She also had 9 large buttons from step 2, so she has 29 + 9 = 38 large buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either in favor or against. Therefore, the total number of votes is equal to the sum of votes in favor and against, which is 2x + x = 3x.

Since the total number of council members is 33, we can set up the equation 3x = 33.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 33 / 3
x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:
Votes in favor = 2x
Votes in favor = 2 * 11
Votes in favor = 22

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as x. 
Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the second house needs 2x. 
The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2x.

Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent playing soccer:

We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x.

Since 2x - 3 = 17 - x, we can solve for x.

2x - 3 = 17 - x
2x + x = 17 + 3
3x = 20
x = 20 / 3
x = 6.67

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, we need to round down to the nearest whole number that would make the total number of fish Bob bought an integer. If x = 6, then the number of orange fish he bought is 2x - 3 = 2 * 6 - 3 = 9. The total number of fish he bought is 6 + 9 = 15, which is less than 17.

If x = 7, then the number of orange fish he bought is 2x - 3 = 2 * 7 - 3 = 11. The total number of fish he bought is 7 + 11 = 18, which is more than 17.

However, if x = 6 and he bought 11 orange fish, that would be a total of 17 fish. So, the number of white fish he bought is 6.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately, then add them together.

Number of students per class: 25
Number of classes: 40

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Number of teachers per class: 3
Number of classes: 40
Total number of teachers: 3 * 40 = 120
Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all of her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Total hours required for the achievement = 30 hours.

Hours Kris still needs to play = 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340.
The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40.
The pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
The pass rate of the fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders, so it is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

The total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.
The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips. So, he has a total of 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, Milo can cover 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we need to divide the total square inches by the height to find the length. 

So, the length will be 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea they consumed is:
16 * 2 = 32 quarts

The total amount of tea consumed is:
6 + 32 = 38 quarts

Adding the remaining amount of tea (10 quarts) to the total amount consumed, we get:

Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21

Now, let's subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag.

Marshmallows left = 35 (initial) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
   Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
   Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

5. Total number of socks and dishes they have together = Total socks + Total dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

"To find the number of students good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students good at both math and English can be found by subtracting the students good at math only and English only from the total number of students.

Students good at both math and English = Total students - (Students good at math only + Students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, we add the students good at math only and those good at both math and English to find the total number of students good at math.

Students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances and the time taken by each group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time available for performances is 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to perform (including getting on and off the stage).

Now, we can divide the total time available for performances by the time taken by each group: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year will be the same: $225.

Total interest earned in 3 years = $225 * 3 = $675.

Total amount after 3 years = Original amount + Total interest earned
= $300 + $675

"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. 
So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. However, we get a $2 discount for each basket of red food, so the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The cost of 3 baskets of red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food baskets and the cost of the red food baskets: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to find out how many rooms that is. Since there are 90 rooms, one-half of the rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so the total time to clean 45 rooms is 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build 96 new homes in the third year, not that the total will be 96. The correct total is the sum of the homes built in the first two years (48) and the homes built in the third year (96), which is 48 + 96 = 144.

"Let's denote the brother's age as B, the sister's age as S, and your age as Y. 

Since you are three years younger than your brother, we can write an equation:
Y = B - 3

Since you are 2 years older than your sister, we can write another equation:
Y = S + 2

We also know that your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age. Let's denote your mom's age as M:
M = 3B - 1

When you add all your ages, you get 87. So, we can write the equation:
B + Y + S + M = 87

Substituting the expressions for Y and M from the previous equations, we get:
B + (B - 3) + (Y - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Since Y = B - 3, we can substitute this expression for Y in the equation above:
B + (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
B + B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87

Combine like terms again:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will try both 19 and 20 to see which one works.

If B = 19:
Y = B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16
S = Y - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14
M = 3B - 1 = 3(19) - 1 = 56

B + Y + S + M = 19 + 16 + 14 + 56 = 105 (not 87)

If B = 20:
Y = B - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
S = Y - 2 = 17 - 2 = 15
M = 3B - 1 = 3(20) - 1 = 59

B + Y + S + M = 20 + 17 + 15 + 35 = 87 (this works)

So, your age is 17.

Number of indoor plants = 1/4 * 100 = 25

Remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75

Number of outdoor plants = 2/3 * 75 = 50

Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to find the speed of the thingamabob first. 

Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Speed of whatchamacallit = 121 meters per second
Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now, we know that the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob. So, we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5 to find the speed of the whirligig.

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once for $6, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's add up the money she made from mowing lawns: $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 last month. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the money she made from mowing lawns from the total: $80 - $54 = $26.

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Duncan's current age be D and Adam's current age be A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52.

We are also given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides, we get:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

Substituting L from equation 2 into equation 3:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute P and L from the above equations into equation 1:

"To find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 * 6 = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars left

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars left

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends:
5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now he has:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars left

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of a pen:
100 / 25 = 4

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word. 
Craig's total letters = 20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters.

Since Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to Craig's total letters to find the brother's total letters.
Brother's total letters = 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled is the sum of Craig's total letters and his brother's total letters.
Total letters = 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we need to calculate the total number of bottles she gets from the coupons and subtract the number of bottles she gives to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

She gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gives away is:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, subtract the number of bottles given away from the total number of bottles:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To find the total charge, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the visit charge and the cost of parts.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we round up to the nearest hour, which is 3 hours. 

Labor cost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, we add the labor cost to the visit charge and the cost of parts:

Total charge = Visit charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he got them for, and the amount he sold 5 of them for.

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, he paid 60% of the total cost. 
60% of $150 is 0.6 * $150 = $90.

He sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got $40 back.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid:

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + D = 45.

Also, since B = D + 10, we can substitute D = B - 10 in the equation A + (A + 20) + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + (A + 20 - 10) = 45.

Combine like terms to get 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers (or 100 pages) to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book (1.5 inches) to find the total number of pages in the book.

Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

"To find the total minutes Kim slept, we first need to find the total minutes she would have slept if she hadn't woken up early and if she hadn't sleepwalked. 

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She also sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. We subtract those 23 minutes from the total: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept 452 minutes on her bed that day.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first calculate the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds, then calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks, and finally subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 
Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
Number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can set up the equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

Distance traveled north in the second leg = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Distance traveled south in the third leg = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled north in the second leg, we subtract this distance from the total distance traveled south:
Net distance = Distance traveled south in the first leg + Distance traveled south in the third leg - Distance traveled north in the second leg
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

In total, Sunny sold 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

In total, Sunny sold 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pie.

Now, we multiply the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie by their respective costs:

3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 2, we know that when Emil is 24, his dad's age will be 24 * 2 = 48.

Since Emil is 19 now, 5 years will pass before he turns 24. So, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43.

From point 3, we know that when Emil is 24, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12.

Since Emil is 19 now, 5 years will pass before he turns 24. So, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines for all 5 baskets.

Each basket has 3 petunias, so for 5 baskets, Katherine will need 3 * 5 = 15 petunias. 
The cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Each basket has 2 sweet potato vines, so for 5 baskets, Katherine will need 2 * 5 = 10 sweet potato vines. 
The cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

The total cost is $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply it by 12.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck, which is:
$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00 per month

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to cook the shrimp separately, then add them together.

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To saute 90 shrimp, it will take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

The total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. 
Temperature change on low: 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour.
Temperature change on high: 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

Total cooling: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Afterward, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour.
Temperature increase: 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

Net temperature change: 18 degrees (cooling) - 4 degrees (warming) = 14 degrees

"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time, and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of the three wolves' howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to first find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. 

The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children: 
Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. 
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

We know the ages of Akbar (3 years old) and Alessandro (4 years old). We also know Helene's age (10 years old). We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of the other three children from the total age:
Wilfred's age = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17

Total number of cookies = 1500

Number of cookies given to the church = 1/2 * Total number of cookies
Number of cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500
Number of cookies given to the church = 750

Now, we can find the number of people in the church next door by dividing the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

Number of people in the church next door = Number of cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
Number of people in the church next door = 750 / 15

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine the total number of slices and the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults. Since there are 4 kids and 2 adults, the total number of slices is 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

The number of slices each adult gets is 2x. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

1. There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.
3. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework:
50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to find out how many seats are available for friends and family. 

Total seats available = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats available for friends and family = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. However, the number of graduates is not given. Since 950 seats are reserved for graduates, we can assume that the number of graduates is 950.

Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950

Her total pay is $15 per day for 3 days, so she earns 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses are $3 per day for 3 days, so she spends 3 * 3 = $9 on parking.

Now, subtract her expenses from her pay: $45 - $9 = $36.

Finally, divide her pay after expenses by the total hours worked: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

Total amount Jim needs to earn: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To calculate the time it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:

The bed is 6 feet long, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer, so the length of the fabric is 6 + 2 = 8 feet. 

The bed is 8 feet wide, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet wider, so the width of the fabric is 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we calculate the area of one piece and then multiply by 2. 

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Total amount lost = $5 (lost) - $11 (won) + $16.50 (lost) = $10.50.

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

Combine like terms:
2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is 10."

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day. 
The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is 45 bananas, and the first and second monkeys eat 24 bananas in a day. 
So, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to determine the cost of the roses and the amount of change she receives.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 more roses at $2 each. 

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 * $5 = $25. 

The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the change is given in quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, the number of quarters she receives is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks needed.
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by the friend from the original price. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid:
$2000 - $1800 = $200

To find the percentage discount, divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:
($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The distance from home to the store is 4 miles. Since James walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance he walked before reaching the store again is:

- 2 miles (halfway to the store) + 2 miles (back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles

Now, we can divide the total distance by James' walking speed (4 miles per hour) to find the total time:

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

The cost of buying the bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.

The cost of buying the bananas in bunches is 10 * $3.00 = $30.

The amount of money Jenny saved is $32 - $30 = $2.

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB ($500 / 2 = $250), and a Trekking bike is $450. 

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, we need to add the class time and extra learning time. However, we can calculate the extra learning time as a fraction of the total weekly minutes, which includes both class time and extra learning time. Let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x.

We know that the class time is 1600 minutes, and the extra learning time is (1/16)x. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours:

Total hours per week = x / 60
Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to get the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, and her brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas.

The number of shaken sodas left is 3 - 1 = 2.
The number of unshaken sodas left is 9 - 1 - 2 = 6.

The total number of sodas left is 2 + 6 = 8.

The probability of choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he takes off is 20% of 50, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

The number of days Billy works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how many years it will take her to reach that goal.

Lauren's retirement savings goal is to live on 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years. 40% of $100,000 is $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she will need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Since Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, and assuming she gets paid bi-weekly (26 pay periods per year), her annual savings is:

$100,000 per year * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

Since Lauren wants to retire in 20 years, she needs to work for 40 years to reach her goal, but she has already worked for some years (the problem doesn't specify how many). However, we can calculate the number of years she has already worked by assuming she started saving from the beginning of her career. 

Assuming she has been working for x years, she has already saved:

$20,000 per year * x years = $20,000x

We know that she needs to work for 40 years to reach her goal, so the amount she has already saved plus the amount she will save in the next 20 years should equal her retirement savings goal:

$20,000x + $20,000 * 20 = $800,000

Simplifying the equation:

$20,000x + $400,000 = $800,000

Subtracting $400,000 from both sides:

$20,000x = $400,000

Dividing both sides by $20,000:

x = 20

This means Lauren has already worked for 20 years. However, this is not possible since she wants to retire in 20 years. This calculation is incorrect, and we need to re-evaluate the problem.

A more realistic approach is to assume Lauren has been working for some years, but we don't know how many. Let's assume she has already worked for x years and has already saved some amount. We know that she needs to save a total of $800,000 and she saves $20,000 per year.

The amount she has already saved is:

$20,000x

The amount she will save in the next 20 years is:

$20,000 * 20 = $400,000

The total amount she will save is the sum of the amount she has already saved and the amount she will save in the next 20 years:

$20,000x + $400,000 = $800,000

Subtracting $400,000 from both sides:

$20,000x = $400,000

Dividing both sides by $20,000:

x = 20

This means Lauren has already saved $400,000. However, this is not the question. The question is how many more years she needs to work.

Since Lauren needs to save a total of $800,000 and she has already saved $400,000, she needs to save an additional:

$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000

Since she saves $20,000 per year, she needs to work for:

$400,000 / $20,000 per year = 20 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save the remaining amount, not the number of years she needs to work from now.

Since she has already worked for some years and has already saved $400,000, and she needs to work for 20 years to save the remaining amount, and she wants to retire in 20 years, the number of years she needs to work from now is equal to the number of years she needs to work to save the remaining amount.

First, subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature: 
2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

Then, add the temperature increase: 
-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius

The final answer is: -3"
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to add the money he initially had to the money he saved, then subtract the money he spent.

Initial money: $21
Money saved: $11
Total money: $21 + $11 = $32
Money spent on comic book: $5
Money spent on puzzle: $19
Total money spent: $5 + $19 = $24
Money left: $32 - $24 = $8

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. 

Anna started with a budget of $16 and had $2 left after buying the books. This means she spent $16 - $2 = $14.

However, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the books. So, the amount she spent on the books is $14 - $4 = $10.

Since Anna bought 2 books for the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount she spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of 50 and add it to 50.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Now, add 10 to 50:
50 + 10 = 60

"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to determine the rate at which it blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times at a rate of 51 blinks per minute. 
We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute: 
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial number of fishes and the number of fishes Tate bought.

Initial male fishes: 4 (guppies) + 3 (goldfishes) = 7
Initial female fishes: 7 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 12

Tate bought: 
Male fishes: 2 (guppies) + 2 (goldfishes) = 4
Female fishes: 1 (guppy) + 3 (goldfishes) = 4

Total male fishes: 7 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 11
Total female fishes: 12 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes:
16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chore. 

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn. 
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog. 
Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their chore: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

"To find the total miles driven per month, we need to calculate the distance of the round trip and multiply it by the number of visits per month.

Distance = Speed * Time
Since it's a round trip, we'll multiply the time by 2.
Time for round trip = 2 * 2 hours = 4 hours

Distance for round trip = 70 mph * 4 hours = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total miles driven per month is:
280 miles * 2 = 560 miles

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to first determine how many miles Sofie will walk in seven days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, she will walk a total of 10 * 7 = 70 miles in seven days.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks. Therefore, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in seven days.

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so in 10 hours, they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so in 10 hours, they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift. This means that the total number of toys produced in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of Elijah's dogs first. 

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog is 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs: 
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds
Total weight: 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

"To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards.

Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. Since Luis used half of the stickers, Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to first find out the total number of M&M's he has. 

He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, so the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces. 

Since an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

Now, if he puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is 900 / 10 = 90.

"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference and then divide it by Alfie's daily flying distance.

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, divide the half circumference by Alfie's daily flying distance:
20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
The average car can go 120 miles per hour. 
So, the 2nd fastest car can go 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 
So, the fastest car can go 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

"To find Vince's current age, we need to determine his age two years ago and then add 2 years to it.

Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

Now, we add 2 years to Vince's age two years ago to find his current age: 7 + 2 = 9.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 

21 - 13 = 8"
"To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately and then add them together.

Weight of crayons: 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces
Weight of boxes: Since Nik has 200 crayons and he puts them into groups of 8, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. 
Weight of boxes: 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Total weight in ounces: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert the total weight to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

Then, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes. We can use this information to find her speed on the beach:

Speed = Distance / Time
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we know that Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of '2x' miles per minute. We can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / (2 * 1/20 miles per minute)
Time = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the sum of the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk:

Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far and how much more she needs to save.

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

She wants to save a total of $60, so she still needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she still needs to save by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can use the concept of weighted averages to solve this problem. The total weight of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug).

The weighted average temperature of the mixture is:
(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
4 * 33 + x ≥ 200
132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:
x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230

With a 10% discount, the cost is $40.00 - (10% of $40.00) = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost of each single bagel: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 
23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops.
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop to find out how many potatoes he ate.
18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester will need for 60 days is:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12:

9/14 = x/84

Cross-multiplying, we get:

756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
$26 / $2 = 13 individual sunflowers per day

Since the question asks for the total number of sunflowers after 3 days, we multiply the number of individual sunflowers per day by 3:
13 * 3 = 39 individual sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:
7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day

For 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in bouquets is:

Since he buys 20 rocks, his total cost is:

20 rocks * $5 = $100

Now, he sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7, so his total revenue is:

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to add the days for each type of scene. However, this would assume she works on one type of scene exclusively until it's done. A more efficient approach would be to work on the scenes in a way that minimizes the total number of days.

One way to do this is to work on the scenes with the largest remainder first. However, in this case, we can simply add the days for each type of scene and then check if there's a more efficient way.

9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days

However, Lauren can work on different scenes in a single day, so we can try to combine the days. 

One possible combination is:
- 6 days for medium-sized scenes
- 7 days for small-sized scenes
- During the 6 days for medium-sized scenes, she can also work on 6 * 5 = 30 large-sized scenes (leaving 15 large-sized scenes)
- During the 7 days for small-sized scenes, she can also work on 7 * 5 = 35 large-sized scenes, but she only needs 15 more, so she can finish the large-sized scenes in 3 of those 7 days.

So, the total number of days is 6 days for medium-sized scenes + 7 days for small-sized scenes, but 3 of those days overlap with the large-sized scenes, so we subtract 3 from the total:
6 + 7 - 3 = 10 days for medium and small-sized scenes, and the remaining 3 days for the large-sized scenes that were already done, plus the 3 days that were overlapped, plus 6 more days for the large-sized scenes that were done in the first 6 days, is not the correct way to calculate this. 
A better way to calculate this is to realize that she can do 5 large-sized scenes, 6 medium-sized scenes, and 7 small-sized scenes in 6 days, 1 day, and 7 days respectively. 
So, she can do 30 large-sized scenes, 36 medium-sized scenes, and 42 small-sized scenes in 6 days. 
Then she can do the remaining 15 large-sized scenes in 3 days, and the remaining 7 small-sized scenes in 1 day.

So, the total number of days is 6 + 3 + 1 = 10 days, but she can do the last 7 small-sized scenes in the 3 days that she is doing the last 15 large-sized scenes, so the total number of days is 6 + 3 =

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
20% * 60% = 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first find out how many seashells they collected in total.

Jim collected 27 seashells. 
Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, so Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
Carrey collected half of what Carlos collected, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

The total number of seashells collected is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

They divided the seashells equally between themselves, so each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, for a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices. The cost of each device is $20, so the total cost is 6 * $20 = $120.

He sells each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40 per device. The total selling price is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost: $240 - $120 = $120.

"To determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs. 

Since 1 bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy needs, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs.

Now, to satisfy 100% of 2300 people's daily energy needs, we need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day, the number of additional bottles needed is 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies

All blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2.

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the combined total is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
Since the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Divide by 6:
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. Then Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -$3

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

Non-yellow paint (red, white, purple) = 12 - 6 = 6 pints

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
   Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home.
   The number of 20 dollar bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

4. The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.

5. Thomas then triples his money.
   Tripling 400 dollars gives 400 * 3 = 1200 dollars.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.
   The number of 5 dollar bills is 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day (if the chalk was full). However, since the chalk is not full, we will use the remaining length to calculate the number of days.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the original 5 inches, we can calculate the number of days as follows:
2.75 inches / 1 inch per day = 2.75 days.

However, the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, so he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the number of days until the chalk is less than 2 inches:
The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches after the first day.
1.75 - 1 = 0.75 inches after the second day.

Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after the second day of using 20% of the original chalk length per day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk. Therefore, the answer is 2 days before he has to recycle the chalk on the third day.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that had passed the expiry date.

Total gallons of milk sold = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5 = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk.
2/5 * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons of sour milk by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount.
Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount he spends ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500), then multiply by 100.

Total books = ($27000 / $500) * 100
Total books = 54 * 100
Total books = 5400

Now, to find out how many books he can buy per school, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools (3).

Books per school = Total books / 3
Books per school = 5400 / 3
Books per school = 1800

"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Kate's 6 friends will eat 6 cheese slices each, so they will eat 6 x 6 = 36 cheese slices in total. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni slices each, so they will eat 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni slices in total. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, for a total of 6 pizzas.

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay gains snowballs is the rate at which he builds them minus the rate at which they melt: 
1/3 - 2/15 = (5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate to find the time it will take: 
60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference. Since John is 28 now and was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can start by finding John's age 20 years ago.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4

Now, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To find out how many bandages they started with, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

However, it's given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Now, we know that they had 3 bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day. This 3 bandages is the sum of the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) and the bandages left at the end of the second day (12 - 28 = -16, but they can't have negative bandages, so they must have used all 12 and 16 more from the first day's order isn't possible, so they must have had more bandages at the start of the first day). Since they used 28 bandages on the second day and only had 12 left from the first day, they must have had 28 - 12 = 16 more bandages at the start of the second day. This means they had 16 more bandages at the start of the first day.

So, the total bandages they had at the start of the first day is 50 (from the bulk pack) + 12 (left at the end of the first day) + 16 (extra bandages) = 78.

16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two amounts:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3c - 2.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, which is c + (3c - 2). Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

Now, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide by 4: c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost, first, calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 
20% of $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 
So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost is the cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

Price in January: $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with the veteran.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie earns $80 per hour. He has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate, so he earns:
4 x $80 = $320

For the lessons with the veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. This means he earns 75% of his standard rate, which is:
$80 x 0.75 = $60 per hour
He has 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran, so he earns:
2 x $60 = $120

"To find the distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total hours he traveled and then multiply it by his average speed.

There are 24 hours in a day. Since Michael traveled for 3 days, the total hours he traveled is:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we will divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning and divide it by the total time available.

Total classrooms = 80
Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Total time spent cleaning = 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes

Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by 5:
1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day

Now, we need to convert the total time available per day from hours to minutes:

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the total number of books one bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books (110) by the number of books one bookcase can hold (55). 

110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it is 54 * 2 = 108.
The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we add the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus rides separately, then add them together.

The cost of the hotel stay is 3 nights * $80 per night = $240.

The cost of one bus ride is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8. Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is 7 * $8 = $56.

The total cost of Helen's trip is $240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
