"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The number of eggs she sells is 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes every day at the farmers' market is 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, this is the value of the house before repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, we can set up an equation to find the new value after repairs:

New value = Original value + (150% of Original value)
New value = $80,000 + (150% of $80,000)
New value = $80,000 + (1.5 * $80,000)
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

But we know the repairs cost $50,000, so the new value after repairs is actually $200,000 + $50,000 = $250,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $250,000 - $130,000 = $120,000.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed is:

3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total amount of feed given so far is:

15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed:

60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

"To find the total cost of the glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass, the cost of the second glass, and then the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The first glass costs $5.
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, the pattern of costs will be: $5, $3, $5, $3, and so on.

There are 8 pairs of glasses in 16 glasses. The cost of each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

The total cost of 8 pairs of glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file before the restart. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. 

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file again. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it took for the Windows update. 

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (update) + 100 minutes (re-download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during those 4 hours.

First, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he turned around, he is now 180 miles away from home.

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled during the 4 hours trying to get home:
- He spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't move.
- He spent 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph: Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles
- He spent the remaining time driving at 80 mph. The remaining time is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Total distance traveled during the 4 hours = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Since he was 180 miles away from home initially, and he traveled 135 miles towards home, the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours is:
Distance = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can add the downloads for each month to find the total: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50.

Let's calculate the total cost and revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.50
Year 2: Total cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Total revenue = $10.50 + $10.50 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Total revenue = $21 + $10.50 = $31.50
Year 4: Total cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Total revenue = $31.50 + $10.50 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Total revenue = $42 + $10.50 = $52.50
Year 6: Total cost = $105 + $3 = $108, Total revenue = $52.50 + $10.50 = $63

We can see that the total revenue is still less than the total cost in the first 5 years. However, in the 6th year, the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108), but in the 7th year, the total revenue will be $63 + $10.50 = $73.50 and the total cost will be $108 + $3 = $111, and in the 8th year, the total revenue will be $73.50 + $10.50 = $84 and the total cost will be $111 + $3 = $114, and in the 9th year, the total revenue will be $84 + $10.50 = $94.50 and the total cost will be $114 + $3 = $117, and in the 10th year, the total revenue will be $94.50 + $10.50 = $105 and the total cost will be $117 + $3 = $120, and in the 11th year, the total revenue will be $105 + $10.50 = $115.50 and the total cost will be $120 + $3 = $123, and in the 12th year, the total revenue will be $115.50 + $10.50 = $126 and the total cost will be $123 + $3 = $126.

However, in the 12th year, the total revenue ($126) is equal to the total cost ($126), but in the 13th year, the total revenue will be $126 + $10.50 = $136.50 and the total cost will be $126 + $3 = $129.

So, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She sold 2 more to the red house. 
Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. 
She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. 
Now, she has (x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left. 
We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks and then convert that to dozens.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the entire 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165. 
$165 / $15 = 11.

So, he sold 11 lego sets.

"To find the distance Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the new throwing distance and then subtract the dragon's reach.

Polly's original throwing distance is 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw three times farther, so the new distance is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find the distance outside of the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from Polly's new throwing distance: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. 
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories.
200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it takes to write each article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

The total number of articles written in the three days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. So, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The answer is: 163"
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we first need to determine the number of blue ties he bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can find the number of red ties by multiplying the number of blue ties by 2.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of a blue tie and add it to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4:
120 units * 3/4 = 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
120 units - 90 units = 30 units

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight of toys to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.

The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

However, since the problem doesn't mention any drawn games, we can assume that the team either won or lost each game. Therefore, the total number of games is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost.

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write an equation:

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of vacations is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt is its own quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations, which is 44.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
The 10% increase is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60.
So, her new monthly salary after the increase is $600 + $60 = $660.

Since this increase happens every year for the next three years, we need to calculate the increase for each year.

Year 1: $660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $660 + $66 = $726
Year 2: $726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 3: $798.60 + 10% of $798.60 = $798.60 + 0.1 * $798.60 = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Now, we multiply the final monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary.

Annual salary = $878.46 * 12 = $10,541.52

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is given as 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 8,000

The number of copies Harald sold is x.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to show up. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, she expects 3/4 of the invited guests to show up.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests expected to show up = 16 * (3/4) = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, the total number of gift bags she needs is:
Total gift bags = 12 * 0.75 = 9

The cost of each gift bag is $2, so the total cost will be:
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each, and there are 20 adults. 
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Children eat half as much as adults, so they eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs each. 
There are 5 children, so 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad needed for adults and children.
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

"To find Jackson's age, we need to determine the ages of the other children first. 

Since James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

Jackson is 4 years old."
"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's original time: 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he now runs 90% of his original time. To find 90% of his original time, we multiply his original time by 0.9.

Gerald's improved time: 40 * 0.9 = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to find the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16 to get the number of cans: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to get the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12.

Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes is:
30 - 5 - 20 = 5

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit is not included in the 5. The 5 is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants initially. She also received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of plants she has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 plants.

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doorbell rings:

Total pages = 39

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total pages to find out how many pages he still needs to read.

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read
Remaining pages = 39 - 15
Remaining pages = 24

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks 1 glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days (since he has soda on the other day), so we add 1 more glass to the total. Therefore, he drinks 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week: 20 + 7 = 27.

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

The inner volume of each box is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. 

90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using a variable to represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Let's call this number x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, the number of cookies he meant to bake this year is 2x.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we know it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the total distance she rowed, we need to find the distance she rows per second and multiply it by the total time it took her to reach the shore.

Distance per second = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second
Total time to reach the shore = 64 seconds
Total distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. To find the total amount of water taken on, we divide the total distance by 10 and multiply by 2.

Total water taken on = (80 feet / 10 feet) * 2 liters = 16 liters

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = x + (0.3 * x)
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769. Since her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume the same percentage increase (40%) for her as well.

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"To find the profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total cost of the doctors and the total revenue from the patients.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes:
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

The cost of the doctors to the hospital is:
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The revenue from the patients is:
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit the hospital makes is the difference between the revenue and the cost:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000
Profit = $10,000

"To find the number of elves left, we need to subtract the elves who quit from the total number of elves.

First, a third of the elves quit. Since there are 60 elves, a third of them is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

So, after the first group quits, there are 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Then, 10 more elves quit. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to calculate his expenditure for June and then add it to his expenditure for May.

Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less, so his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add his expenditure for May and June: $500 + $440 = $940.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides and multiply it by the cost per ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam) + 6 (Fred) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 
So, his total mileage for Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

We are given that his total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. 
To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total mileage for Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday: 
41 - 28 = 13 miles.

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into Q + B + W = 700, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W: W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

1 person with a unicycle had 1 tire inflated.

Total tires inflated = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Cost per tire is 25 cents, so the total amount made is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.

2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. The total number of fries eaten so far is 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
5. The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which means 1/3 of the fries remained. Let's call the total number of fries x. Then, the number of fries remaining after the raccoon is x - 30 (since 30 fries were eaten already).
6. We know that the raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so the number of fries remaining after the raccoon is 1/3 of the total remaining fries. This can be written as: (x - 30) * 1/3 = 5 + 1 (since the ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 behind).
7. Simplifying the equation, we get: (x - 30) * 1/3 = 6.
8. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: x - 30 = 18.
9. Adding 30 to both sides, we get: x = 48.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the age of each bird. 

We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: 
8 (Sally Four) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the total minimum payment and then the total payment with the 50% increase.

Minimum payment:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we calculate the increase:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add the increase to the minimum payment:
Total payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
Yearly payment: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut a potato, we need to add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to cut. 

Time to peel a potato: 1 minute 30 seconds = 1.5 minutes
Time to cut a potato: 5 seconds = 0.0833 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel and cut a potato: 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the total time per potato by 60:

Total time to peel and cut 60 potatoes: 1.5833 * 60 = 95 minutes

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards. 

First, let's find out the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can divide this by the profit per gallon to find out how many gallons they made: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now, we know that they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so the total cost of lemons is 5 * $3 = $15.

Zaid's salary is 6000$. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$

Total spent so far: 1500 + 2000 = 3500$

Remaining amount: 6000 - 3500 = 2500$

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$

Remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$

Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

Loser's votes = Total number of votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

"To find the number of red roses Sandra ordered, we first need to find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. 

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.

Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

From statement 1, Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4x400 meter relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So, the times for each runner are:
60, 57, 54, 51 seconds

The total time taken by this team is:

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. There are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling an even number on the second roll. 

There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 or 1/2. Since the die is rolled twice, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 0.25.

Now, we need to find the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage. 

The difference in probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. This will give us the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats: 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by 6 to find the total number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, to find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the total number of rats by 3: 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

The selling price per bag is $30.

The profit per bag is the selling price minus the total cost per bag, which is $30 - $22 = $8.

The total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

8x = 400

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags.

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net gain is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year. After 10 years, he has planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees and chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees. The net gain is 100 - 20 = 80 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom has 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees. 

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The number of red chickens Jerry has is 4."
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

On the first day, she counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers she counted on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

In the last 4 minutes, both pools lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now we know that the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8 gallons

Total cost = $352.00

Now, we'll divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:

Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours = 44

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, which is the initial amount borrowed plus 10% of that amount.

Initial amount borrowed: $2000
Additional amount (10% of $2000): $2000 * 0.10 = $200
Total amount owed: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Since Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months:

Total amount paid: $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed to find the remaining balance:

Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:
Total flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total flowers = 4 + 11
Total flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 times Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. 
Adrian's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years.
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats. So, their combined weekly consumption is:

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine per week:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens.

When the ink runs low, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, after using the initial 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens, which can be mixed to make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, Ram has 5 new pens and 0 empty pens. When the ink runs low in these 5 pens, he will have 5 empty pens, which can be mixed to make 5 / 5 = 1 new pen.

Now, Ram has 1 new pen and 0 empty pens. When the ink runs low in this 1 pen, he will have 1 empty pen, which is not enough to make a new pen (since 5 empty pens are required to make 1 new pen).

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is the sum of the initial pens and the new pens he made: 25 (initial pens) + 5 (first set of new pens) + 1 (second set of new pen) = 31.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes in a week.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page. So, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the total time Mike spends writing a week is 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying by 400 pounds.

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the weight after the termites ate 30% of the tree.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's count the total number of fruits:
Andrea's apples: 52
Andrea's bananas: 24

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so she's making 36 + 30 = 66 cookies in total.

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide 66 by 12 to get the total number of dozens: 66 / 12 = 5.5.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to get the total amount of flour needed: 5.5 * 2 = 11.

"To find the total time, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.
2. It takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. 
   To find 40% of 20 minutes, we multiply 20 by 0.4, which is 8 minutes. 
   So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

3. The total time to warm up the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes.
4. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. 
   So, the time to cook is 48 - 5 = 43 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time to warm up the oil and the time to cook.
Total time = 48 minutes (warming up) + 43 minutes (cooking) = 91 minutes.

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a way that each piece of paper has a front and back. But in the given arrangement, page 1 is on the left back and page 32 is on the right back, which means that the first and last pages are on the same side of the paper. This implies that the pages are arranged in a way that each piece of paper has two front pages and two back pages.

In this case, we can still divide the total number of pages by 4 to find the number of pieces of paper used, since each piece of paper has 4 pages (2 front and 2 back).

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 4
= 32 / 4
= 8

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
She also spent an additional $10 for rides, so the total amount spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine the number of books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year and there are 50 unsold books left. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200. 

Since she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

Now, we know that the total number of books sold is 200, and she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the third year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonuses.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours per week. Since he earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500 per week.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so his total bonus for the month is 4 * $300 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings for the month are his hourly wage earnings for the month plus his bonuses. His hourly wage earnings for the month are 4 * $500 = $2000. Adding his bonuses, his total earnings for the month are $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks and then multiply by 4.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.
8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

For the ice cream, the original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we are buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses and subtract that from his total budget, then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of a business suit is $100. 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit, so the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total expenses: 
$600 (business suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000. 
So, the amount he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners is: 
$6000 (total budget) - $1950 (total expenses) - $2000 (savings) = $2050

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also told that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera was 40 years old six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

Now, we are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Finally, we are told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60,000 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D', the number of players on the offense as 'O', and the number of players on the special teams as 'S'. 

We know that O = 2D (twice as many players on the offense as on the defense) and S = D/2 (half the number of players on the special teams as on the defense).

We also know that the total number of players is 105, so O + D + S = 105.

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D, we get:
2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(4D + 2D + D)/2 = 105
(7D)/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2:
7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:
D = 30

Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, we need to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B.
$11 (Juice Box C) - $9 (Juice Box B) = $2

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies eaten by her son and her husband, then subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies eaten by her son and her husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

"To find the percentage increase in daily earnings, we need to calculate the difference in daily earnings and then divide it by the original daily earnings.

Original daily earnings (tractors) = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
Current daily earnings (silos) = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Difference in daily earnings = $1100 - $1000 = $100
Percentage increase = (Difference / Original daily earnings) * 100

The monthly cost of treats is $20.

The monthly cost of medicine is $100.

The total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number of plant pots she bought.

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. They need twice as many for the roses, so they need 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Total plant pots needed = 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90

April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought:

"To find the total time John spent sightseeing, we first need to find the total time he spent on all activities. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 
So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so the total time spent on all activities is 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so the time spent sightseeing is 50 * 0.4 = 20 hours.

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much she has earned and add it to her initial savings.

At her first job, Annabelle earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200.

At her second job, Annabelle earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

In total, Annabelle earns 200 + 75 = $275 from her jobs.

Adding this to her initial savings of $80, Annabelle now has 275 + 80 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, Annabelle still needs to save 400 - 355 = $45.

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $.05 each. So, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * .05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must have been 2 * 2 = $4.

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is 10 - 4 = $6.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is 6 / 1.5 = 4.

"To find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. 

The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

Number of days = 18,000 / 900 = 20

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

2. A number equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

   So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

   So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for these three reasons:
3 (masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31

So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is $20 * 0.8 = $16.

The total cost of his new streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Now, let's compare this to his old cable package, which cost $60 a month.

The amount of money Tim saves is $60 (old cable package) - $26 (new streaming services) = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first calculate the total time she spent on the song.

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent editing:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time spent) * 100
= (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she had initially and then subtract the cards she passed out, and add the cards she received.

Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so she had:
20 (cards she made) + 2 * 15 (cards from her dad) = 20 + 30 = 50

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she passed out a total of:
24 + 5 = 29

Now, subtract the cards she passed out from the total cards she had:
50 - 29 = 21

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so add those to the cards she has left:
21 + 17 = 38

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices and Jenny's portion.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices (12 * 1/3 = 4).

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices (12 * 1/4 = 3).

So, Bill and Mark have 4 + 3 = 7 slices in total.

Jenny eats 2 slices.

Now, subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark, and Jenny's portion from the total number of slices: 12 - 7 - 2 = 3.

"To find out how many days Mark has to save his money, we need to calculate the total amount he still needs to save and then divide it by his daily earnings.

Mark already has $50 in his bank account, and he wants to buy a bike that costs $300. So, the amount he still needs to save is:

$300 (bike cost) - $50 (initial savings) = $250

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the amount he needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10) to find out how many days he needs to save:

$250 / $10 = 25 days

"To determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark will need:
- 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups of flour
- 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need:
- 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need:
- 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days at the original usage and the reduced usage.

Original usage: 900 watts * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day
Since there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, we can convert this to kilowatt-hours (kWh): 7200 watt-hours / 1000 = 7.2 kWh/day
In 30 days, the original usage would be: 7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh

Reduced usage: 900 watts * 3 hours/day (since 8 - 5 = 3) = 2700 watt-hours/day
Converting to kWh: 2700 watt-hours / 1000 = 2.7 kWh/day
In 30 days, the reduced usage would be: 2.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 81 kWh

Now, we can find the energy saved by subtracting the reduced usage from the original usage: 216 kWh - 81 kWh = 135 kWh

"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to first determine the number of corns and cannolis he has.

Initially, Allan has 40 cannolis. Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the total number of cannolis he has now is 40 + 60 = 100.

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, which means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

The total number of corns he has now is 80 + 60 = 140.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140 + 100 = 240.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before the jog, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps taken.

Now, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before the jog and after the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000.

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, so the time it takes him to read the book is:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport, and it takes 10 minutes to get there, so the time he has available to read is:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30.
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600.
The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

Next, let's find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. 5% of the more dangerous candles (which are the ones that can explode) will smell like wet dog. Since 500 candles can explode, 5% of these will smell like wet dog.

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = 5% of 500

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price per blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
3. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as x.

Now, let's consider her sister's gathering:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
2. She gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
3. She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

(45 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 350."
"Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation: 
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute the value of 'c' into the first equation to find 'd':

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (36 / 2 = 18) able to have two hotdogs. This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who could have two, and 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests. So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 + 18 = 54.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs requested is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26.

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we first need to determine how much money he spent on chips and how much he had left to spend on candy bars.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, we subtract the money spent on chips from the total money spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the money spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of lollipops he shared. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

He shared the 20 lollipops equally among his 4 friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the total number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake. 

First, we need to find the weight of one piece of cake. Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we divide the total weight by 8:
20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces in total. The weight of the two pieces eaten is:
2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake:
20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. The total number of oranges is 34 + 22 = 56.

Since they are sharing the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 / 8 = 7.

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find the difference in their travel times and add the extra 5 minutes Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

The difference in their travel times is 16 - 4 = 12 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 12 + 5 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:
3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = length * width) to find the width:
360 square feet = 9 feet * width
width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)) to find the perimeter:
Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads (red)
2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads (clear)
Total beads Elizabeth has: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads (blue)
4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads (red)
Total beads Margareth has: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:
Difference in beads = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike ride) + 50 minutes (run) 
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, James' swim time = 40 - (10% of 40) 
James' swim time = 40 - 4 
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, so James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 
James' bike ride time = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes 
James' total time = 170 + 10 
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time. 
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike ride time 
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85 
James' run time = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

Movie A = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours at 32MPH:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 32MPH x 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Cost = Total hay x Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails x $3/bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

$5 x 6 = $30

Now, we can calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

Change = Total money - Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The total cost of the sneakers is $576.

On Monday, the salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The rest of the sneakers sold to the department store is:
48 - 17 = 31 sneakers

The revenue from selling the rest of the sneakers is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from selling the rest of the sneakers:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket option and the regular ticket option.

The super ticket option costs $20 (movie ticket) + $1 (popcorn and soda) = $21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket option must be $21 - $2 = $19.

The regular ticket option costs $12 (movie ticket) + $3 (soda) + x (popcorn). We know the total cost is $19, so we can set up the equation:

$12 + $3 + x = $19

Combine the constants:
$15 + x = $19

Subtract $15 from both sides:
x = $4

The regular price of popcorn is $4.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to calculate the additional cost. 
20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300.
So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the plane tickets and the hotel cost: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, so Jasper has half as many, which is 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, so Jasper has three times as many, which is 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint Jasper has: 2 + 9 = 11.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny first. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 + 48
Combined weight = 84

"To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we first need to determine how many songs each of them can add.

Gabriel has 20 songs and can store up to 100 songs. So, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which is 3 * 20 = 60 songs. He can store up to 100 songs, so he can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

"To find the total hours James runs a week, we need to first find the total miles he runs a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs 10 miles an hour, we can find the total hours he runs a week by dividing the total miles by his speed: 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in five days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats consumed in 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats consumed by the weight of each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have a total of 8 razors. 

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor:

$2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.25 * 100 = 25 cents

The cost for the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost for the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want the costs to be equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, the number of insects David found as D, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David).
We also know that D = B/2 (David found half of what Bodhi found).
We are also given that L + D + B = 43 (Together they collected 43 insects).

Substituting D = B/2 into L = D + 7, we get L = B/2 + 7.

Now, we can substitute L and D in terms of B into the equation L + D + B = 43:
(B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

Combine like terms:
2B/2 + B = 43 - 7
B + B = 36
2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
B = 18

Now that we know B, we can find D:
D = B/2
D = 18/2
D = 9

Now that we know D, we can find L:
L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

Ada's initial daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
Ada's new daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
Initial daily consumption: 12 kWh/h * 24 h = 288 kWh

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it takes for one person to paint half a house:

5 days * 24 hours/day = 120 hours

Since one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, it would take the same person 240 hours to paint a whole house (twice the time).

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the total time it would take to paint a whole house would be:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first find the number of chairs each person has. 

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs each person has. 
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost. 

The total cost of the CD and the headphone set is $48. The cost of the CD is $4. 

So, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. 

Since each CD costs $4, we can divide $44 by $4 to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought: $44 / $4 = 11.

So, Tom could have bought 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphone set. Since he already bought 1 CD, he could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the usual 4-hour routine, and add the hours spent in the weeks with the 5-hour and 6-hour routines.

Josh had a 4-hour routine for 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks (since 2 weeks had a 5-hour routine and 1 week had a 6-hour routine). 
The total hours spent in the 5 weeks with the 4-hour routine is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

The total hours spent in the 2 weeks with the 5-hour routine is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

The total hours spent in the week with the 6-hour routine is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

The total number of hours Josh spent working out is 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to calculate the changes at each stop.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on compared to the number who got off. Since 21 people got off, 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

2. In 8 years, Jame's age will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will be 2 * 30 - 5 = 55 years.

4. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

5. The difference in their current ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We also know the cost of the computer and the printer. So, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is half the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to find out how many seashells the boys brought in total and then calculate the total number of seashells the girls brought. 

Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells the boys brought is 10 * 60 = 600 shells.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is 3000 / 10 = 300.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to find out his total savings for the first half and the second half.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half, let's assume the daily savings in the first half is 'x'. Then, the daily savings in the second half will be '2x'.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

The total savings for the first half will be 15x, and the total savings for the second half will be 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total savings for the month should be $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:
45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:
x = 25

Since Elvis saves '2x' in the second half, his daily savings in the second half will be 2 * 25 = 50.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

However, the question asks about a hot day, not a warm day. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water, we will assume that the time for warm water is the same as the time for hot water, which is 34 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day and a hot day. On a cold day, it takes him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. On a hot day, it takes him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she will withdraw in 2 years and subtract it from the initial amount.

Katina removes $100 from the account every month. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, she will remove:
$100/month * 12 months/year * 2 years = $100 * 12 * 2 = $2400

Now, let's subtract the total amount she will withdraw from the initial amount:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:
10 x $7.00 = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

The total cost is:
$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayon muffins she can make and then multiply that by the selling price.

First, let's find out how many small pieces of crayons Kate has in total. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so:
3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since each crayon is worn down to small pieces, we'll assume each crayon can be broken down into the same number of small pieces. However, the exact number of small pieces per crayon is not given. For the sake of calculation, let's assume each crayon can be broken down into 8 small pieces (this is a reasonable assumption given that 8 small pieces are used to make one muffin crayon). 
So, the total number of small pieces is:
192 crayons * 8 small pieces/crayon = 1536 small pieces

Now, let's find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make:
1536 small pieces / 8 small pieces/muffin = 192 muffins

Finally, let's calculate how much money Kate can make:
192 muffins * $1.50/muffin = $288

"To find the total cost of replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal of the old carpet, and installation of the new carpet.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

"To find the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we need to first find out how many cards the brother has. 

The brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has: 
5 (boy's cards) - 3 = 2

Now we know the brother has 2 cards. To find the total number of cards, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has:
5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature: 450
Actual temperature: 468
Difference: 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set her oven to, so that it reaches 520 degrees. Since the oven is off by 4%, we can set up the following equation:

Actual temperature = Set temperature + (Set temperature * 0.04)
520 = Set temperature + (Set temperature * 0.04)
520 = Set temperature * 1.04

To find the set temperature, we can divide both sides by 1.04:

Set temperature = 520 / 1.04
Set temperature = 500

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding 30 minutes to this gives us:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time in the same way:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding 5 minutes to this gives us:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we can add the time of the two movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

Total time: 215"

"To find the total number of utensils, we first need to determine the number of cups and dishes each person brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils by adding the cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:
Judy's cups: 12
Judy's dishes: 24
Friend's cups: 40
Friend's dishes: 44

Total utensils = 12 + 24 + 40 + 44 = 120

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts and then divide it by the total number of contacts.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 boxes of contacts with a 10% discount:
Original price of 1 box = $100
Discount = 10% of $100 = 0.1 * $100 = $10
Price of 1 box with discount = $100 - $10 = $90
Price of 2 boxes with discount = 2 * $90 = $180

Now, let's calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes:
Number of contacts in 1 box = 90
Number of contacts in 2 boxes = 2 * 90 = 180

Now, let's calculate the cost of each pair of contacts:
Cost of each pair of contacts = Total cost of 2 boxes / Total number of contacts

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each of them and then multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings. Jill's total earnings is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total earnings is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times 200 calories fit into 1600 calories. 

1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the result by 100 ml to find out how many ml of water she needs to drink.

8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Since the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B. The jar also contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now we can find the number of red jelly beans (0.99B) and the number of green jelly beans (1.01B):

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

Day 2: 8 feet (doubled from 4 feet)
Day 3: 16 feet (doubled from 8 feet)
Day 4: 32 feet (doubled from 16 feet)

Since the window is 20 feet off the ground, the beanstalk needs to be at least 21 feet tall to be taller than the window. On Day 3, the beanstalk is 16 feet, and on Day 4, it is 32 feet, which is taller than the window.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:
3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Now, we can calculate the grams of protein John gets per day:
200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the grams of protein per day by 7:
6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:
10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the discount and subtract it from the initial $50.

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
30% of $60 is 0.3 * $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included in the final cost, we don't need to add anything else. Now, we subtract the final cost from the initial $50 to find out how much money Joe will have left: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find the total amount of butter needed, we need to calculate the amount of butter needed per day and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed per day is:
4 dozen * (1/4 pound/dozen) = 4 * 0.25 = 1 pound per day

Since Juan wants to make croissants for a week, which has 7 days, the total amount of butter needed is:
1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost to repave Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

To find the cost of repaving Monica's street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial funding, which is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month. 50% more than this is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't consume any meat.

Total ounces of meat consumed: 30"
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of posts per day and then multiply it by the number of days in March.

Assuming a non-leap year, March has 31 days.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used and multiply it by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height at the end of each week.

In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so its height became 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so its height became 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells per day and then divide the weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat per hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

The bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat, we divide the weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

750kg / 150kg per day = 5 days

"To find the number of students, we need to first find the total number of seats and then subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

Total number of seats = 4 rows * 18 seats per row = 72 seats

Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights. 

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we subtract the 20 non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights to find the number of functioning street lights: 96 - 20 = 76.

DVD 2 has been played 135 times, so it has 1000 - 135 = 865 plays left.

Now, we add the remaining number of plays for both DVDs: 644 + 865 = 1509.

"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, twice a week, for 2 hours each time. So, the total number of hours per week is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. 

Since he went for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125. Therefore, the total cost is 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7.

The number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to perform a few conversions.

First, we know that 1 Mb has 1000 kb. So, we can convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per second to Mb per second by dividing by 1000.

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Next, we need to convert the time unit from seconds to hours. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we can multiply Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour.

0.02 Mb/s × 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately, then add them together.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

In the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

"To find James' commission, we first need to calculate the profit made by the company on each car. 

The selling price of each car is $25,000. 
The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars, so the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500.

The profit made by the company on each car is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit made by the company is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply the total number of riders (100) by 0.25.

Total riders who can stay upright = 100 * 0.25 = 25

Next, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply the total number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 0.6.

Number of women who can stay upright = 25 * 0.6 = 15

Finally, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright
= 25 - 15
= 10

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels based on the given information.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, so:
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so:
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding their individual prices:
Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of truck stamps and rose stamps.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them.

First, we need to find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed:

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative speed

We know the distance between them is 75 miles, and the relative speed is 15 mph:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

The total number of customers they process daily is 50 + 100 = 150.

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's total. 

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost per orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
5 apples = 5 x $1.30 = $6.50
5 oranges = 5 x $1.10 = $5.50

The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third of the king cab upgrade cost is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500
6. Towing package: The cost of the towing package is not given, so we cannot include it in the calculation.

Total cost = Base price + King cab upgrade + Leather seats + Running boards + Upgraded exterior light package
Total cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to find 5% of his current salary and add it to his current salary. 

5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000.

New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Total monthly income (including bonus) = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500.

However, the bonus is only given once a year, so we need to calculate the total yearly income by multiplying the new monthly salary by 12 and adding the bonus.

Total yearly income = ($21,000 * 12) + $10,500 = $252,000 + $10,500 = $262,500.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to first find the total amount she made from selling green hats. Since her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can calculate the total amount from green hats as follows:

Total amount from green hats = 2 * Total amount from red hats
Total amount from green hats = 2 * $400
Total amount from green hats = $800

Now, we can find the total amount she made in the first month by adding the total amount from red hats and green hats:

Total amount in the first month = Total amount from red hats + Total amount from green hats
Total amount in the first month = $400 + $800
Total amount in the first month = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate the total amount she made in the second month as follows:

Total amount in the second month = 3/4 * Total amount in the first month
Total amount in the second month = 3/4 * $1200
Total amount in the second month = $900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months by adding the total amount she made in the first month and the second month:

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means the number of dogs doubled. So, the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.

However, 3 dogs left, so we subtract 3 from the total number of dogs: 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs a total of 21 toys."
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to first calculate the amount invested by Dylan and Frances.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

The amount remaining after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

This remaining amount is Skyler's investment.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first determine how many signatures they already have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44. The total number of signatures they have is 20 + 44 = 64.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. To find out how many signatures they need to collect, we subtract the total number of signatures they already have from their goal.

100 (goal) - 64 (current signatures) = 36

The sisters need to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, she works a total of 2 * 3 = 6 hours in two days.

Now, we can calculate Karen's total earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

Katarina has 68 cookies. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can add up the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298 cookies.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

She then adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20. 

We are given that the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 
1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:
1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 80

The original length of the dress is 80cm."
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took for each half and then add them together.

In turtle mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. So, to mow half the lawn in turtle mode, it would take him 60 / 2 = 30 minutes.

In rabbit mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode, it would take him 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time it took for each half: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation: T = t + 7.

We know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44. Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get: 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin using the first equation: T = t + 7. Substituting t = 6, we get: T = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that 5 lollipops cost $0.40 each, so 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 
Since 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, 4 candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 
So, one candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. 
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00. 
So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate the number of coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.
Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, and the dog needs 2 vaccines, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. Then, the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out the total number of chairs she currently has and the total number of chairs she needs.

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48.

The total number of people attending the function is 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57.

Since each person needs a chair, Mia needs 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs she needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs she currently has from the total number of chairs she needs: 57 (total chairs needed) - 48 (chairs she currently has) = 9.

When Helga raises her arms, both feet tap at 200 taps per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised, the total taps in this case is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

The combined total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of not fixing it.

The cost of not fixing the pothole is $450 (the damage to Ron's car).

The cost of fixing the pothole includes:
- The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75
- The fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
Total cost of fixing the pothole: $75 + $120 = $195

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole:
$450 (cost of not fixing) - $195 (cost of fixing) = $255

Chairs sent for repair:
Normal chairs = 20
Baby chairs = 13
Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13 = 33

Now, subtract the total chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:

"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the number of slices eaten and subtract it from the total number of slices.

There are 5 pizzas in total, each with 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 * (2/3) * 12 = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42.

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18.

"To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we first need to find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. 

Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes 
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time the two take to eat the sausages. 

Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2 
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 
Average time = 50 / 2 
Average time = 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as x. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90.

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10.

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, by 16:00, a total of 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000 people had voted.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day. 
In 30 days, he will chew 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to calculate each of their ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
= 2 * 15 + 8

= 38 years

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
So, Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4

Now, we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age

2. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

4. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

5. She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. She trades these for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

6. In total, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons.

Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons to get the total. Since a large button is worth 3 small buttons, 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

"To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find Ahmed's total.

Ezra read 300 books. 
Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so Ezra's new total is 300 + 150 = 450 books.

The total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600 books.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold. 

20 (vanilla scents) - 16 (fruity scents) = 4

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is:
20 * $3 = $60

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make:
$135 - $60 = $75

This means Bennet needs to make $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn:
$75 / 25 = $3

"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to find the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time remaining after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Time remaining after reading - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, to find the percentage of time spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:

Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Time spent driving back home is the same as the time spent driving to the museum, which is 2 hours.

Time spent at the museum = 6 hours

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of movie separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these movies is 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie
The total cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $1.67 = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these movies are older movies, which is:
400 * 0.4 = 160 movies

The cost of these older movies is $5 each, so the total cost is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are:
400 - 160 = 240 movies

The cost of these movies is $10 each, so the total cost is:
240 * $10 = $2400

Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 
Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
Their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Distance hiked = Speed * Time = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Total distance to the vacation spot = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies and collects 'y' berries. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. Also, Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points for enemies: 
Emma: 10x
Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Points for berries:
Emma: 5y
Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7:

"To find the number of additional students, we first need to calculate the total number of students at the end of May. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:
- Beginning of the year (January): 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:
Additional students = Total students at the end of May - Initial students
Additional students = 320 - 10
Additional students = 310

Total branches climbed = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by 7.

Average branches climbed per day = Total branches climbed / 7
Average branches climbed per day = 420 / 7
Average branches climbed per day = 60

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first determine the total number of marshmallows left. 

Initially, there were 35 marshmallows in the bag. John and DeSean used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows to make S'mores. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

So, the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21.

Now, subtract the total number of marshmallows used or dropped from the initial number of marshmallows: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 2 kids, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. This friend will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of zest as 'x'. Then the amount of fragrance is also 'x'. The amount of salt is 2x, and the amount of sugar is also 2x. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so it's 2 * 2x = 4x.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10

Combine like terms:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10
10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 1

Now that we know x is 1, we can find the amount of oil (4x):

4 * 1 = 4

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of cards each person has. Let's say PJ has x cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

Smendrick has 3x = 3(47) = 141 cards

And we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards

The cost of 3 baskets of red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food baskets and the cost of the red food baskets: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 * 20 = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 / 60 = 15 hours

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this number gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build double the amount they have built so far, not double the amount they have built in the first two years and then add it to the first two years. So, the correct calculation for the third year is 2 * 48 = 96, but this is the total amount they will have built, not the amount they will build in the third year. The amount they will build in the third year is 96 - 48 = 48.

Now, we can add the number of homes built in each year to find the total number of homes built over the next three years: 12 + 36 + 48 = 96.

"Let's denote my age as 'A', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as:
A = B - 3

I am 2 years older than my sister, so:
A = S + 2

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. Let's denote my mom's age as 'M'. 
M = 3B - 1

When you add all our ages, you get 87. 
A + B + S + M = 87

Now, let's substitute the expressions for A and M into the equation:
(B - 3) + B + (A - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 + 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
(B - 3) + B + (B - 1) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine like terms:
6B - 6 = 87
6B = 93
B = 15.5

Since B must be a whole number, we'll round it to the nearest whole number. However, we'll try both 15 and 16 to see which one works.

If B = 15:
A = B - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12
S = A - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10
M = 3B - 1 = 3(15) - 1 = 44
A + B + S + M = 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81 (not 87)

If B = 16:
A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
S = A - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11
M = 3B - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 47
A + B + S + M = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87

So, the correct answer is:

Day 2: 70 people are infected. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 70 * 6 = 420. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 2 is 70 (previously infected) + 420 (newly infected) = 490.

Day 3: 490 people are infected. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 490 * 6 = 2940. The total number of infected people at the end of Day 3 is 490 (previously infected) + 2940 (newly infected) = 3430.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 6 badges (12 months / 2 months per badge).

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's compare the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year. Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges. To find the difference, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

He plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 per chicken to make a profit of $2000. 
So, the total amount he will make from selling the chickens is the cost price plus the profit.
Let's denote the cost price as x.
Then, the selling price is x + $2000.

The selling price per chicken is $50, so the total selling price for 180 chickens is 180 * $50 = $9000.

Since the selling price is the cost price plus the profit, we can set up the equation:

The cost of the chicken is twice as much as a pack of bacon, so it's $2 x 2 = $4 per packet. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 x $4 = $24.

The cost of the strawberries is $4 per pack, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12.

"To find out how many notebooks Joseph had, we first need to determine how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since Martha bought 5 more notebooks for a total of 7, she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's: 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate the distance rowed by Anis. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:
Distance rowed by Dijana = 50 miles
Distance rowed by Anis = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Distance rowed by Anis = 50 + 10
Distance rowed by Anis = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
Total distance = Distance rowed by Dijana + Distance rowed by Anis
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 5 more than Daniel's 13 pages today. So Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. 

Denise's total pages read = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today.

Daniel's total pages read = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel.

Difference in pages read = Denise's total pages read - Daniel's total pages read

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Duncan's current age be D and Adam's current age be A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8, and Adam's age four years ago was A - 4.

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2:

30 = A

So Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

Time for a normal sudoku puzzle = 45 minutes
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 4 * Time for a normal sudoku puzzle
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 4 * 45 minutes
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 180 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks:
Number of bottles = Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle / 30 minutes
Number of bottles = 180 minutes / 30 minutes

"To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to first determine the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is:

20 red balloons * 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon = 40 pieces of bologna

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total:

58 total pieces - 40 pieces at red balloons = 18 pieces at yellow balloons

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can divide the total number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons:

18 pieces at yellow balloons / 3 pieces per yellow balloon = 6 yellow balloons

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so we can write the equation:

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write the equation:
L = J + 10

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can write the equation:
P = L + J

Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Substituting the expression for P into the first equation, we get:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Now that we know Paul's and John's ages, we can find Peter's age:

29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles she gives away from the total number of bottles she gets:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the visit charge and the cost of parts.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we round up to the nearest hour, which is 3 hours. 

Labor cost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, we add the labor cost to the visit charge and the cost of parts:

Total charge = Visit charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he got them for, and the amount he sold the unwanted CDs for.

The total cost of the CDs is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got the CDs for 40% off, he paid 60% of the total cost. 
60% of $150 is 0.6 * $150 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got $40 back.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid:
$90 - $40 = $50.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 
Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. 
So, the bakery has 490 - 40 loaves of bread.

490 - 40 = 450

"To find Leo's age, we need to first find Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus' age as follows:

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age:

Marcus' age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + D = 45.

Also, since B = D + 10, we can substitute D = B - 10 in the equation A + (A + 20) + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + (A + 20 - 10) = 45.

Combine like terms to get 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to first find the total number of pages per inch, considering that each paper is printed on both sides. Since there are 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, the actual number of pages per inch is 200 (100 pages per inch * 2 sides per paper).

Now, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches to find the total number of pages.

Number of pages per inch: 200 pages/inch
Thickness of the book: 1.5 inches

Total number of pages = Number of pages per inch * Thickness of the book
Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the rate at which he staples reports.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes Vince spent stapling reports is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, so his rate is:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the rate:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total minutes Kim slept, we first need to calculate her total sleep time if she hadn't woken up early. 

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 8 hours by 60 minutes to get 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract those 5 minutes from her total sleep time: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she spent sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. 

So, we subtract the sleepwalking time from her adjusted total sleep time: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has 2 dozen cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups. 

So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the number of measuring cups and the number of measuring spoons. 

Total utensils = 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34.

Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, the total number of occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds
The total number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the third day, and the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

The total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is the difference between the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the total number of holes at the end of the third day. 

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can set up the equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13

Distance traveled in the northerly direction for 2 hours:
Distance2 = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the last 5 hours:
Distance3 = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Total Distance South = Distance1 + Distance3 = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

Since the bird traveled 36 miles in the northerly direction, we subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction:

Since Emil will be 24 when his dad is 48, and Emil is currently 19, we can find the number of years until Emil turns 24 by subtracting his current age from 24: 24 - 19 = 5 years.

Now, we can find the current age of Emil's dad by subtracting 5 years from his age when Emil turns 24: 48 - 5 = 43 years.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Since Emil will be 24 when his brother is 12, and Emil is currently 19, we can find the number of years until Emil turns 24 by subtracting his current age from 24: 24 - 19 = 5 years.

The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.
Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck, which is:
$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00 per month

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them, then add the two times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, we can multiply the time it takes her to sauté 30 shrimp by 3 (since 90 is 3 times 30):

10 minutes * 3 = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté them:

15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on low is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on high is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

"To find the number of flights the first plane makes, we need to determine the number of flights the second plane makes and then double it, since the second plane's flights are half the number of the first plane's flights. 

The second plane makes 44 trips. Since this is half the number of the first plane's flights, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 flights.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between France and Germany. 

So, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

Average age = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The neighbors donated $500, and the online fund collected $1500. So, the total amount collected from these sources is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend also donated $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match, as Walter will tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200.

Since the lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

Three times the total amount collected is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:
1500 cookies * 1/2 = 750 cookies

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find the number of people, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine the total number of slices and the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults. There are 4 kids, so the total number of kid slices is 4x. There are 2 adults, so the total number of adult slices is 2(2x) = 4x.

The total number of slices is 4x + 4x = 8x.

Each adult gets 2x slices, so the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2x / 8x) * 100% = 25%.

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic:

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total number of sessions per month is 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $40 per session * 12 sessions/month = $480.

Total number of babies born in a year = 48 * 30
Total number of babies born in a year = 1440

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the total number of babies born.

"To find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we need to calculate the total amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 + 4125 = 13025 gallons.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation to get the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals as 4(2L) = 8L.

The total earnings from the sales of both large and small stuffed animals is $120, so we can set up the equation:

For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.

For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package will also be $1.50. 

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 from selling his old bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 
50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats for graduates and faculty: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats for friends and family: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the seats for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. However, the number of graduates is not given. Since 950 seats are reserved for graduates, we can assume that the number of graduates is 950.

Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

Now, since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3 to find the number of small beans he can eat. 

So, 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, so she earns 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses are $3 per day for 3 days, so she spends 3 * 3 = $9.

Her earnings after expenses are 45 - 9 = $36.

Since Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

However, since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will only need to move to 7 more bottles. 

Now, we can multiply the number of bottles he needs to move to by the time it takes to move to each bottle:

7 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 35 seconds

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and width.

New length = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
New width = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of the fabric piece by multiplying the new length and width.

Area = length * width = 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2.

Total area = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

The total amount lost is $5 (first race) - $11 (second race, since he won) + $16.50 (third race) = $10.50.

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

Combine like terms:
2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, for a total of:
25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is:
45 - 4 = 41 guests

Since the fee is $125 for a party of 20, and there are 21 additional guests (41 - 20 = 21), the additional cost is:
21 * $6 = $126

The total cost of the party is the initial fee plus the additional cost:
$125 + $126 = $251

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to calculate the amount they spent and subtract it from their initial amount.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 * $60 = $15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * $60 = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money they have left:
Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left
Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left

The total amount of money they have left is $45 + $40 = $85

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to find out the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to get the total number of bananas eaten in a day:
315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is:
10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten in a day:
45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to determine the total cost of the roses and the amount of change she receives.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 more roses at $2 each. 

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 * $5 = $25. 

The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the change is given in quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, the number of quarters she receives is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to break down the arrival and departure times of each train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. It will leave 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after the initial time.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves. So, it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the initial time. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. It will leave 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after the initial time.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves. So, it arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the initial time. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, it arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the initial time.

Since Paul needs to get on the fourth train, he will wait for 145 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks needed.
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 more toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and then compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll calculate the discount amount and then divide it by the original price.

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by the friend
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount amount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 10%

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

The distance from James' home to the store is 4 miles. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the distance he walked before returning home is 4 / 2 = 2 miles. 

After walking 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, he still needs to walk the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the total time it took him to reach the store is the total distance divided by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

"To find the amount of money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually.

First, let's find the total number of bananas: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying the bananas individually is 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.

The cost of buying the bananas in bunches is 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.

The amount of money Jenny saved is $32 - $30 = $2.

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The difference between the number of bales the farmer makes and the number of bales the truck picks up is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To find the extra learning time, we need to calculate the total weekly minutes he spends in class and extra learning time. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, so there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week.

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time, so he spends (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes per week on extra learning time.

The total minutes John spends learning per week is 1600 + 630 = 2230 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 2230 / 60 = 37.17 hours.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he works is 80% of 50 days. 
80% of 50 days = 0.8 * 50 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how many years it will take her to reach that goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's desired annual retirement income. Since she wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Desired annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000
= 0.4 x $100,000
= $40,000

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we can calculate her total retirement savings goal as follows:

Total retirement savings goal = Desired annual retirement income x Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 x 20
= $800,000

Next, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate it as follows:

Annual savings = 20% of $100,000
= 0.2 x $100,000
= $20,000

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal:

Number of years to reach goal = Total retirement savings goal / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can determine the total number of years she needs to work to reach her goal, which is 40 years.

Assuming she has been working for some years already, let's assume she has been working for x years. Then the number of years she needs to work is 40 - x.

However, since we don't know the value of x, we can't provide a numerical answer."

Since Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her current daily total is:

125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her current daily total from the required daily total:

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he had initially and the money he saved, then subtract the money he spent.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11 from his allowance, so the total amount of money he had is $21 + $11 = $32.

He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount of money he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, let's subtract the money he spent from the total amount of money he had: $32 - $24 = $8.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. We know that she had a budget of $16 and spent $4 before buying the books. So, the remaining budget before buying the books was $16 - $4 = $12.

After buying the books, Anna had $2 left. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total cost of the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = $10 / 2 = $5

"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to determine the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times at a rate of 51 blinks per minute. 
We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute: 
459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial number of fishes and the number of fishes Tate bought.

Initial number of male fishes: 4 (male guppies) + 3 (male goldfishes) = 7
Initial number of female fishes: 7 (female guppies) + 5 (female goldfishes) = 12

Number of male fishes Tate bought: 2 (male guppies) + 2 (male goldfishes) = 4
Number of female fishes Tate bought: 1 (female guppy) + 3 (female goldfishes) = 4

Total number of male fishes: 7 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 11
Total number of female fishes: 12 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes:

"To find the total miles driven per month, we need to calculate the distance of the round trip and multiply it by the number of visits per month.

First, we find the distance of the one-way trip. Since distance = speed * time, and the speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours, the distance is 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2: 140 * 2 = 280 miles per visit.

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the distance per visit by 2: 280 * 2 = 560 miles per month.

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we first need to determine how many miles Sofie will walk in seven days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

It is given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. So, we divide the total miles Sofie will walk by 2 to find the miles Brian will walk.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.
Weight of Elijah's second dog = 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight.
Total weight = Weight of Elijah's first dog + Weight of Elijah's second dog + Weight of Kory's dog
Total weight = 15 + 30 + 60

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs painted is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
21 (Camden's eggs) - 13 (Arnold's eggs) = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

The weight of the crayons is 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and can hold 8 crayons, the number of boxes needed is 200 crayons / 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes. The weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

Then, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

Time spent on the beach = 40 minutes
Distance on the beach = 2 miles
Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles per minute

So, 'x' = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now, let's find the time spent on the sidewalk:
Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile
Speed on the sidewalk = 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute
Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes

Total time spent on the walk = Time spent on the beach + Time spent on the sidewalk
Total time spent on the walk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time spent on the walk = 50 minutes

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second mug of water. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug into his water bottle, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can set up an equation based on the concept of heat transfer and the conservation of energy. Since the heat energy is directly proportional to the temperature and the mass (or volume, in this case, assuming the density of water is constant), we can set up a weighted average equation:

(4 oz * 33°F + 1 oz * x°F) / (4 oz + 1 oz) ≥ 40°F

Combine like terms and simplify the equation:

(132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides to isolate x:

x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add them to the initial number of animals.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 21 days, they bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 21 days, they bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Initially, there were 50 cows and 20 chickens. After adding the new animals, the total number of cows is 50 + 420 = 470, and the total number of chickens is 20 + 210 = 230.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700.

So, the total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, to find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. 
To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

Total reports received in the week = 5168
Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

"To find out how much money Abraham will be able to earn, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from selling his land.

Initially, Abraham had 80 square meters of land. 

He sold half of the land (80 / 2 = 40 square meters) for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land (80 / 4 = 20 square meters) for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left.

He sold the remaining 20 square meters of land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

The total amount he earned is $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is 26 / 2 = 13. 

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

13 - 10 = 3

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses per day and then multiply it by 2.

Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. So, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
2 face masks/time * 3 times/day = 6 face masks/day

Now, we multiply the number of face masks he uses per day by 2 to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days:
6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

"To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to first determine the total number of eggs hidden and then subtract the number of eggs found by the children.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden to find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard: 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
400 + 240 = 640 apartments in the last complex.

Now, we add the apartments from all three complexes:
400 + 640 = 1040 apartments in total.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. To find the total payment per week, we multiply the number of apartments by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection:
1040 apartments * 3 collections/week * $.40/collection = 1040 * 3 * 0.40 = 1248

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 3 times the initial amount = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- Year 7: 7 times the initial amount = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 8: Let's denote the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree as x. Then, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 20 times the initial amount = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Since we know that a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree:
x = 1000
x - 200 = 800 fruits

Now, let's add up the number of fruits produced each year:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B and B = Y - 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get:

4B + B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:
B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. Then Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -$3

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided among the remaining colors (red, white, and purple). 

Given that there are 12 pints of paint in total, half of it is yellow, so the yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The remaining half (6 pints) is divided among the three colors (red, white, and purple) in equal amounts. So, each color gets 6 / 3 = 2 pints.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
100 + 20 = 120 pods in the special size box.

Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is 12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide $1 by the cost per pod. 
$1 / $0.1 = 10 cycles.

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
   Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home.
   The number of 20 dollar bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   Half of 40 is 40 / 2 = 20. So, he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

4. The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = $400.

5. Thomas then triples his money.
   Tripling his money means multiplying it by 3. So, he now has 400 * 3 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.
   To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount by 5: 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
- Total goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find 20% of the original 5 inches, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used each day (1 inch), but we also need to consider that the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days. However, since the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to subtract the amount that will be left after 2 days (1 inch) from the total remaining chalk (2.75 inches) and see if it is less than 2 inches. 
2.75 - 2 * 1 = 0.75 inches, which is less than 2 inches but the teacher can still use it for one more day since he will be left with 0.75 - 1 = -0.25 inches which is less than 0 but he can't use it. So he can use it for 2 more days and then he will have to recycle it on the next day.

However, the question asks for the number of days before he has to recycle the chalk. So the answer is 2 days before he has to recycle it on the next day.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to find out the total number of books he can buy with $27000.

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the number of books he can buy per dollar by dividing 100 by 500.

100 books / $500 = 0.2 books per dollar

Now, we can multiply this rate by the total amount Bob has to spend, $27000.

0.2 books per dollar * $27000 = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

However, we know they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means that 78 - 75 = 3 bandages were left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Since they had 3 bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day, and 12 bandages were left at the end of the first day, and 28 bandages were used on the second day, we can set up the equation: 12 - 28 + x = 3, where x is the number of bandages they started with.

Solving for x, we get: x = 3 + 28 - 12 = 19.

So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50. The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer left after all the incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

- On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
- On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
- On the third day, his friend drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, there are 3 guests, plus Fred, making a total of 4 people. 

To find out how much root beer each person can have, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people: 8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons per person.

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be represented as an equation: 
4x + 8 = 40

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. First, subtract 8 from both sides:
4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. First, we need to find the number of remaining fish after subtracting the fish with red stripes. 

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Now, we need to calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish to find the number of fish with blue stripes.

Number of fish with blue stripes = 5/11 * 44
Number of fish with blue stripes = 5 * 4
Number of fish with blue stripes = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes
Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = 22 + 20
Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = 42

"Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, which is 2 * 4 = 8 colors. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, which is 3 * 6 = 18 colors. 

Her sister stole one palette, so Amy lost 4 colors. Now she has 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the palettes. 

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she used 6 / 2 = 3 colors. Now she has 18 - 3 = 15 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy has 4 colors from the palettes and 15 colors from the makeup sets.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to first calculate the total height of the house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

However, this is the height from the ground to the second floor's ceiling. Since we want the height from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor's ceiling, which is the same as the first floor's ceiling, 180 inches, from the total height of the house and then subtract the height of the first floor's ceiling from that result. But since the second floor's ceiling is the same height as the first floor's ceiling, we can just subtract the first floor's ceiling from the total height of the house and then subtract the first floor's ceiling again. 420 - 180 = 240, then 420 - 180 - 180 = 60.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is the sum of the amounts removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to find the capacity of each school and then add them together.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of each of John's classes by multiplying 120 by 1/8.

Capacity of each of John's classes = 120 * 1/8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15 = 30 students.

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's school (which is the same as his class) and the capacity of John's school.

Combined capacity = Capacity of Ali's school + Capacity of John's school

"To find the total volume of the jar, we multiply the base area by the height. The base area is 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches. The volume is 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume occupied by the jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the occupied volume by the volume of a single jelly bean. The total number of jelly beans is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches = 2880 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original price per bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Total cost per bag: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to convert the total cost to cents. 
$15.00 = 1500 cents

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.
Cost per stick = 1500 cents / 30 sticks
Cost per stick = 50 cents

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test and how many questions she needs to get right in total.

On the first test, Audrey got 60% of 70 questions correct. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

The total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.
To pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct.
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since Audrey already got 42 questions correct on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write an equation:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write another equation:

s + b = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know 's', we can find 'b' by substituting 's' into the first equation:

b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

Number of blueberry cubes: 96"

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate each type separately.

There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, so the total number of flashlights is 4. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, so that's 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights. The total number of flashlights is 4 + 16 = 20.

For the candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 candles. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the final answer.

Number of footballs = 40

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is half the number of helmets.
Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.
Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs

Timothy's pens = 54

Now, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. So, we can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

Sarah's pens = 1/2 * Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = 1/2 * 54
Sarah's pens = 27

"To find Jackie's height before the summer, we need to first find Anne's height and then Jackie's current height.

Albert is 36"" tall. 
Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne's height is 2 * 36"" = 72"".

Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie's current height is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, her height before the summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and multiply it by the price per bar.

The company produces 5000 bars per day. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, the company produces:
5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35000 bars/week

In two weeks, the company will produce:
35000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70000 bars

The company sells each bar for $2, so the total amount of money it will receive is:
70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 at the original price of $8 each. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, he pays full price for the first T-shirt ($8) and 50% off for the second T-shirt ($8 * 0.5 = $4). The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discount is $16, so the price Jake pays for the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying ice cream cones.

Ryan's allowance for 3 weeks is $6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 cones at $1.25 each. The total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, subtract the cost of ice cream cones from Ryan's allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

Ryan has $13 left to spend on movie tickets. Each ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, divide the amount of money he has by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he works in 2 weeks and the total number of cars he services.

Josh is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, the total number of cars he services in 10 days is 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks are 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

Total cookies initially = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack (1 of each flavor):
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Total cookies after snack = 8 + 3 + 4 = 15 cookies

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:

"To find out how many holes the dog dug, we multiply the number of holes the dog digs per day by the number of days Nate was on vacation. 

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Now, we need to find out the net number of holes Nate fills in per day. Since the dog digs 6 holes per night, Nate's net holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day.

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes.

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate Butler High School's enrollment as follows:

Butler High School enrollment = 3/4 * Norman High School enrollment
Butler High School enrollment = 3/4 * 4000
Butler High School enrollment = 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in enrollment = Norman High School enrollment - Butler High School enrollment
Difference in enrollment = 4000 - 3000
Difference in enrollment = 1000

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes Igor gathered.

Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so Igor gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so Igor gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + x beakers = 29 items.

We know that Igor gathered the correct number of beakers initially, which is 7. However, he lost some on the way to the lab bench. Let's denote the number of beakers he lost as y.

So, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is 7 - y.

Now, we can set up the equation: 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + (7 - y) beakers = 29 items.

Combine the constants: 8 + 16 + 7 = 31.

Now the equation is: 31 - y = 29.

Subtract 31 from both sides: -y = -2.

Multiply both sides by -1: y = 2.

The final answer is: 2"

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Aaron ran and how long it took Vanessa to run her part of the race.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run half the distance that Vanessa did. So, Aaron ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

We are given that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would have taken twice as long to run the same distance. So, Vanessa would have taken 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

However, we want to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since she takes 32 minutes to run 2 miles, she would take twice as long to run 4 miles. So, Vanessa took 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to run 4 miles.

"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we need to multiply the total feet of dock by 3, since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

Total feet of dock = 200 feet
Feet of line needed per foot of dock = 3 feet

Total feet of line needed = Total feet of dock * Feet of line needed per foot of dock
Total feet of line needed = 200 * 3
Total feet of line needed = 600 feet

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract this from the total feet of line needed to find out how much more he needs to buy.

Feet of line needed to buy = Total feet of line needed - Feet of line already available
Feet of line needed to buy = 600 - 6
Feet of line needed to buy = 594

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine his current age. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had James when he was 19 years old, so the age difference between John and James is 19 years.

Now, we find John's current age. Since James is 18 years old, John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. The age difference between John and his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

The cost of the radiator after the discount is:
$400 - $320 = $80

The cost of the mechanic's labor is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours:

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write the second equation as:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' the same in both equations:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can divide by 2 to find 'w':

w = 15

Now that we know 'w', we can substitute it into the first equation to find 'c':

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, the number of chickens is 5.
