"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The number of eggs she sells is 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes every day at the farmers' market is 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. 
The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, the $50,000 in repairs also contributed to the increased value. To find the selling price, we need to add the $50,000 to the new value of the house, which is $200,000 + $50,000 = $250,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $250,000 - $130,000 = $120,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs 3 * 3 = 9 sprints per week.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance he runs per week is 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to find out the total amount of feed needed for the day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses in pairs, since every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass.

The first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. So, the cost of a pair of glasses is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to get 8 pairs of glasses. The cost of 8 pairs of glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

However, this calculation assumes that the discount applies to every second glass, not just the second glass in each pair. To get the correct answer, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses in a different way.

The first glass costs $5, the second glass costs $3, the third glass costs $5, the fourth glass costs $3, and so on. We can calculate the cost of the glasses as follows:

$5 + $3 = $8 (first pair)
$5 + $3 = $8 (second pair)
$5 + $3 = $8 (third pair)
$5 + $3 = $8 (fourth pair)
$5 + $3 = $8 (fifth pair)
$5 + $3 = $8 (sixth pair)
$5 + $3 = $8 (seventh pair)
$5 + $3 = $8 (eighth pair)

The total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

However, this is still not correct, since the eighth pair only has one glass left, which costs $5. We need to subtract $3 from the total cost to get the correct answer.

$64 - $3 = $61

The final answer is: $61"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to find the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file, which takes 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he was in standstill traffic, so he didn't move.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drove at 30 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drove at 80 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

However, we also need to consider the distance he traveled before turning around. He drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the number of downloads in the third month, we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the total cost and the total earnings.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. Each year, the tree will earn $1.5 * 7 = $10.50 from selling lemons, but it will also cost $3 to water and feed the tree, resulting in a net gain of $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year.

To break even, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of $90. We can divide the initial cost by the net gain per year to find the number of years it will take to break even:

$90 / $7.50 = 12 years

However, this is the number of years it will take to break even, not to start earning money. Since Carlos will start earning money after he breaks even, we need to add 1 year to the result.

12 + 1 = 13 years

"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She sold 2 more to the red house. 
Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. 
She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. 
Now, she has (x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left. 
We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify, multiply both sides by 2:

2(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

(x - x/3 - 2) = 10

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3x - x - 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000, the increase in value is 1.2% of $8,000:
$8,000 * 0.012 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher increase in value, which is the jewelry. The profit would be $125.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching.

As a teacher, she earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, she earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Her total annual salary is the sum of her earnings from teaching and coaching:

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we first need to determine how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs per day, she eats 3 * 28 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 84 by 12 to get 7.

84 / 12 = 7

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

Time left = Total time - Time already taken
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, we can find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. Since 1 liter was spilled, we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his age at the time of his son's birth.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:
Raymond's current age = Samantha's current age + 6 years
Raymond's current age = 31 + 6
Raymond's current age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract his age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at the time of his son's birth
Years ago = 37 - 23

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling the lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - (165 / 15) = 13 - 11 = 2 lego sets less than he had.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had initially and after using some, then subtract the initial number from the total.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. 
She used 220 Post-it notes at work. 
She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let's assume the number of Post-it notes she purchased is 'x'. 
The total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing is 80 + x. 
After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 remaining. 
So, the equation becomes: 
80 + x - 220 = 23

Now, let's solve for 'x': 
80 + x - 220 = 23 
x - 140 = 23 
x = 23 + 140 
x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is 163."
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to first find out how many blue ties he bought and then how many red ties he bought.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

252 / 12 = 21 dozen eggs per day.

Now, let's calculate Lloyd's daily earnings. 
He sells eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 * 2 = $42 per day.

To find out Lloyd's weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. 

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books. So, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight he still needs to remove (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

The total number of pets is the sum of the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the number of boys is 2/5 * 200 = 80. 

The number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120.

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is 2/3 * 120 = 80.

The number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = 40.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes (32 * 2 = 64). 

Since each can is 16 ounces, we divide 64 ounces by 16 ounces per can to find the number of cans: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12.

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = 30
Cars that took the exit = 5
Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Cars that drove through the traffic jam = Total number of cars - Cars that took the exit
= 30 - 5

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants initially. She also received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of plants she has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 plants.

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we can add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell to find the total number of doorbell rings:
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks a glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so that's 1 more glass of water. However, he has a soda with dinner on the other weekend day, so we don't count that one. Therefore, he drinks 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water on weekends.

In total, John drinks 20 + 7 = 27 glasses of water in a week.

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. 
The inner dimensions will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each side for the walls.
The inner dimensions are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The inner volume of each box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. 
On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. 
On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. 
90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since he wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he intended to bake 2x cookies this year. However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

The number of cookies Henry baked last year is 50."

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many feet Julia rowed to reach the shore. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how many feet she rows per second by dividing 20 feet by 16 seconds. 
20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can find out how many feet she rowed by multiplying the time by the speed.
64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. To find out how many 10-foot intervals she rowed, we divide the total feet by 10.
80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we multiply the number of intervals by 2 liters.
8 intervals * 2 liters/interval = 16 liters.

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

It is given that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

So, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

"To find the profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost price and the total selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

Total hours for Tuesday and Wednesday = 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. 
Total hours for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday = 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Since Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, she has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left to run at 5 miles per hour.

Distance at 5 miles per hour = Speed * Time = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into Q + B + W = 700, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W: W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total expenses first. Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, so he's expecting 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.

Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Cost of bottles of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Cost of packs of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 12/3 = 4 harvests in a year.

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:
James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends

"To find out how long the winner will be waiting, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
5. Let's say the total number of fries in the pack initially is x.
6. After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30.
7. The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate (2/3)(x - 30) fries.
8. The remaining fries after the raccoon are (1/3)(x - 30).
9. The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 behind, so (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
10. Now, let's solve for x: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
11. Multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
12. Add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the hours spent per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, the total hours for these days are 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, the total hours for these days are 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Total hours per week = 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours spent attending classes in a semester = 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. 

Let's multiply the number of white carnations by 4 to find the number of red roses:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

Since Jan is 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Mark's current age would be 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age would be 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team and then find the difference.

The well-rounded team has 4 members, each running 400 meters in 55 seconds. 
Total time for the well-rounded team = 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team has 4 members with different running times:
- The first runner runs in 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Now, let's find the difference in time between the two teams:
Difference = Total time for the less well-rounded team - Total time for the well-rounded team
= 222 - 220
= 2 seconds.

However, the question asks how many seconds the faster team will win by. Since the well-rounded team is faster, we need to subtract the total time of the well-rounded team from the total time of the less well-rounded team. But since the well-rounded team is faster, the correct calculation is already done above.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling an even number on the second roll. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 0.25.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage. The difference is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. This will give us the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats: 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we divide the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by 6 to find the total number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, to find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the total number of rats by 3: 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

The selling price per bag is $30.

The profit per bag is the selling price minus the total cost per bag, which is $30 - $22 = $8.

The total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

8x = 400

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags.

The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since the three friends agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3. 
$102 / 3 = $34.

"To find the number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the number of trees he has after 10 years, then subtract the number of trees that die.

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net gain is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year. After 10 years, he has planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees and chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees. The net gain is 100 - 20 = 80 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom has 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees. 

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so he earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Mark earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

However, since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the 5% raise for the entire year. The 5% raise is calculated as:
$2000 per week * 0.05 = $100 per week
So, his new weekly salary is:

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus and the number of days for the return trip by car.

The trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. 
The return trip by car takes half as many days as the bus trip, so it will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (to Rochester by bus) + 3 (return by car) = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to find the total number of cards and the number of water type cards after James loses 8 and buys 14 grass type cards.

Initial number of water type cards: 40
Number of water type cards lost: 8
Number of water type cards remaining: 40 - 8 = 32

Initial number of grass type cards: 20
Number of grass type cards bought: 14
Number of grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Total number of cards initially: 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90
Total number of cards now: 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Now, we can find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To find out how many hours it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle and then convert that to hours.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many, so her mom can add 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

There are 360 pieces in the puzzle. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add per minute:

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we can divide by 60:

60 / 60 = 1 hour

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons that were ready and subtract them from the total.

Initially, 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 melons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, Ashlyn harvested 63 more watermelons, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21.

The tax is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so for 12 cars, it's 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, in a week (7 days), he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes.

His girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats, so she eats 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Together, they eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, to find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes a vine produces per week.

63 / 3 = 21

So, Steve needs 21 vines."

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial pens and the pens he makes by mixing the ink.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens.

When the ink runs low in these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the initial 25 pens.

Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

When the ink runs low in these 30 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, he can make 30 / 5 = 6 new pens from the 30 pens.

Now, he has 30 (previous pens) + 6 (new pens) = 36 pens.

When the ink runs low in these 36 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, he can make 36 / 5 = 7 (with 1 pen left over) new pens from the 36 pens, but since he can't make a full pen with the leftover ink, we'll stop here.

Now, he has 36 (previous pens) + 7 (new pens) = 43 pens.

He is pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people. 
Each of them sends 2 letters a week, and he responds in kind, so he writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week. 
Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes writing a week. 
To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the total stitches for the sleeves can be found by subtracting the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately, then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.
The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are his lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are his lines, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, we add the lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to find the number of cards remaining after subtracting the cards with A, B, and C.

First, find the number of cards with A: 2/5 * 80 = 32

Now, subtract the cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48

Next, find the number of cards with B: 1/2 * 48 = 24

Now, subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24

Then, find the number of cards with C: 5/8 * 24 = 15

Now, subtract the cards with C from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9

The remaining cards have the letter D.

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages and then add those numbers together. Since we know the sum of their current ages is 20, we can add 10 + 10 to that number.

Current sum of ages: 20
Adding 10 years to each: 20 + 10 + 10 = 20 + 20 = 40

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write the equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. We can write the equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Substituting R = 6S into the second equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
S = 6

Sam is 6 years old now."
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

The total amount Peter paid is $5 + $2 = $7.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2 to find the number of spots on a mamba.

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots they all have combined = 4900 / 2 = 2450

"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first need to find out the total number of people. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

Now, we add the team members, coaches, and guests: 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people. 

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3 to find out the number of pizzas needed: 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Now, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza to find out the total cost: 13 * 15 = 195 dollars.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads, we first need to find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each is 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the remaining length by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

"To find the brother's age in 3 years, we first need to find his current age. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we multiply Ann's age by 2.

Brother's current age = 2 * Ann's age
Brother's current age = 2 * 9
Brother's current age = 18

Now, we add 3 years to the brother's current age to find his age in 3 years.

Brother's age in 3 years = Brother's current age + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 21

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents.
She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents.
So, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. 
To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 
145 - 55 = 90 cents.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

3 rows of 8 stars = 3 * 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

76 (total stars) - 36 (stars in 8-star and 6-star rows) = 40 stars

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, divide the total number of stars in 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

40 stars / 5 stars per row = 8 rows

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, so the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance. 

time = distance / speed
time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour

Now, we add Ali's and Izzy's medals to find their total.
Total medals Ali and Izzy have: 22 + 17 = 39

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total medals Ali and Izzy have.

Total medals given out = 10 * 39
Total medals given out = 390

"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to find out the total number of chocolate bars and then subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

4 adults get 6 chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars the adults get is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we subtract that from the total time: 
3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes: 
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 10: 
150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval: 
15 * $5 = $75

"To find the total points of the three players after the extra points, we need to calculate their points after the fourth round.

Mike has 21 points initially. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets 1 extra point. 
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets 1 extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points after the extra points:
Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
Jim: 18 points (no change)
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how long the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of rice consumed per week is:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 2 = 16 pieces of paper

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a specific way. In reality, the pages are arranged in a way that the first and last pages are on the outside, and the middle pages are on the inside. This arrangement is achieved by folding the paper in half, and then folding it in half again.

When the paper is folded in half, the first and last pages are paired, and the middle pages are paired. Since there are 32 pages, the first and last pages are Page 1 and Page 32, and the middle pages are paired as follows:

Page 2 (back) and Page 31 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 30 (front)
...
Page 16 (back) and Page 17 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

However, we need to consider that the first and last pages are also paired, so we need to add 1 to the result.

16 pieces of paper / 2 = 8 pieces of paper (for the middle pages)
+ 1 piece of paper (for the first and last pages)

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to find out how many books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, so she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Since Watson works 5 days a week, he works a total of 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 20 days in a month.

Watson works 10 hours a day, so in a month, he works 10 hours/day * 20 days = 200 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so his total earnings from his hourly wage in a month is 200 hours * $10/hour = $2000.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. In a month, he gets 4 weeks * $300/week = $1200 bonus.

Watson's total earnings in April is $2000 (hourly wage) + $1200 (bonus) = $3200.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks and then multiply by 4.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. 

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is 105, so we can set up the equation:
D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(2D + D) + D/2 = 105
3D + D/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
6D + D = 210
7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:
x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:
3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we can calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs, and chickens have 2 legs.
Total legs = (number of cows * 4) + (number of chickens * 2)
Total legs = (20 * 4) + (40 * 2)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to find the weight of each animal first.

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds. 
Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds
Green toad: 50 pounds
Yellow snake: 60 pounds
Red bird: 30 pounds
Container: 20 pounds

Total weight: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

Now, we need to find the difference in revenue: $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100:

"To find the total time John spent, we need to first calculate the time he spent on each activity. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 
So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so we can set up the equation:
15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time spent.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, the total time spent is 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20

At her second job, Annabelle earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

Adding her earnings from both jobs to her initial savings, Annabelle now has 80 + 200 + 75 = $355.

Since he spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must be $2 * 2 = $4.

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4.

The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of Dasha's tickets and compare it to the cost of David's ride bracelet.

Dasha needs 9 rides, and each ride costs 2 tickets. So, she needs 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. Each ticket costs $2, so the total cost of Dasha's tickets is 18 * $2 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30.

The difference between the cost of Dasha's tickets and David's ride bracelet is $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of gifts (6 + 4 + 2 = 12).

Total gifts = 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts
Total ribbon = 144 inches
Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts = 144 / 12 = 12

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

We can then divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of one part: 165 / 11 = 15.

Since Betty has 5 parts, she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"To find the savings, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and subtract it from the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the total cost is 2 * $10 * 0.8 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

The savings is the difference between the cost of the cable package and the cost of the streaming services: $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first find the total time she spent on the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. 
She spent half of 4 hours recording it, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours. 
She spent 90 minutes editing it, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Total time spent on the song is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of time she spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total time and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find double the number of books that can fit in the shelving system. 

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is 6 * 6 = 36.

Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants 20 more than double the number of books, so she needs 72 + 20 = 92 books.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she had initially and then subtract the cards she passed out, and add the cards she received.

Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so she had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards initially.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out 24 + 5 = 29 cards in total.

Now, we subtract the cards she passed out from the cards she had initially: 50 - 29 = 21.

Then, we add the cards she received: 21 + 17 = 38.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark, then subtract that from the total number of slices and also subtract the slices eaten by Jenny.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices.

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices.

So, Bill and Mark together have 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices.

Now, subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark, and the slices eaten by Jenny from the total number of slices: 12 - 7 - 2 = 3.

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can divide the amount he needs to save by his daily earnings to find out how many days he needs to save.

Amount Mark needs to save: $250
Daily earnings: $10
Number of days Mark needs to save: $250 / $10 = 25

"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the number of days he works in a year and multiply it by his daily wage.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
52 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 312 days/year

However, the problem states that the builder works 4 weeks every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is:
12 months/year * 4 weeks/month = 48 weeks/year

So, the total number of days he works in a year is:
48 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

The builder earns $50 per day, so his total earnings in a year are:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400

For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, Tyson will need to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so for 5 sandwiches, he will need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To find the total number of corns and cannolis, we need to first determine the initial number of corns and cannolis, then add the additional items Allan bought.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, which is 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the initial and additional corns: 80 + 20 = 100 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he took before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps (10,000 / 2 = 5,000) on his walks to and from school. 
He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 
So, the total steps before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000.

Since Elliott had 2,000 steps left after the jog, the total steps he took before and during the jog is 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000.

Now, to find out the steps taken during the jog, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before and during the jog: 
8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000.

"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read the book and then subtract that from the total time he has before leaving for the airport.

The book is 45 pages long, and it averages 200 words per page. So, the total number of words in the book is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find the time it takes him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby needs is:
30 minutes (to read the book) + 10 minutes (to get to the airport) = 40 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the total time he needs from the time he has:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30.
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. So, the total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of Sally's purchases is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, add the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by the number of cookies per recipe:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/recipe = 5 recipes

First, let's find the number of candles that will explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% will explode. 
1% of 50000 candles is 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles.

Next, let's find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. 5% of the candles have this defect.
5% of 50000 candles is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles.

However, we are interested in the intersection of the two events, i.e., the candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the two events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of the two events.

The probability of a candle exploding is 0.01, and the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 0.05. The probability of both events occurring is 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005.

Now, we can multiply this probability by the total number of candles to find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode:

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. She gathered half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 = 45 apples. The total number of apples gathered by her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. The total number of apples gathered by both sisters from the tallest and shortest trees is 45 + 105 = 150 apples.

So, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples. Since Joanne's sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, all 350 apples were gathered by Joanne.

"Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write an equation: 
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can write another equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting 'c' into the first equation:
124 + d = 180

We know that he sold each card for $1.5, so we can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find the number of cards he sold:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, this is the number of cards he sold, not the number he started with.

$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of:
$2 + $16 = $18

Now, we subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (Dora's money) = $1

"To find the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew in sequence.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is (3/4) * 100 = 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is (1/5) * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to first find out how many gallons were in 1/4 of a container. 

15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

1/4 of a container is 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, 3/4 gallon is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to first determine how much money he spent on chips and how much he had left to spend on candy bars.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, we subtract the money spent on chips from the total money spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a candy bar to find out how many candy bars he bought: $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 
Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Since they are sharing the oranges equally with 6 other friends, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8 people.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges everyone will get.
Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find the difference in their travel times and add the extra 5 minutes Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne.

It takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

The difference in their travel times is 16 - 4 = 12 minutes. However, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we add this extra time to the difference.

12 minutes (difference in travel time) + 5 minutes (to arrive before Wayne) = 17 minutes.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards). First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack * 20 beads = 20 beads (red)
2 packs * 20 beads = 40 beads (clear)
Total beads Elizabeth has: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has:
3 packs * 20 beads = 60 beads (blue)
4 packs * 20 beads = 80 beads (red)
Total beads Margareth has: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
- 10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
- 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time:
- James' run time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:
Total hay = Distance * 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, let's calculate the change:
Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the cost.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is 17 * $20 = $340.

He sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to a department store for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The profit is the total revenue minus the cost, so the profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

The regular ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3. Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket with popcorn and soda is $21 - $2 = $19.

Now, subtract the cost of the regular ticket and soda from the total cost to find the regular price of popcorn. 

$19 (total cost) - $12 (regular ticket) - $3 (soda) = $4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost per balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 
Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons 
Cost per balloon = $900 / 20 
Cost per balloon = $45 

After the price increase, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65. 

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. 
Cost of 170 balloons = Number of balloons * New cost per balloon

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is $10,000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15,400.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, so Jasper has half as many, which is 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, so Jasper has three times as many, which is 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint and 9 tubes of yellow paint, so in total, he has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

"To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to calculate three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 3/4 * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in five days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, Uncle Ben needs 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

The original price of 2 packs of razors is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. However, since they are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack, which is $4.00. 

She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the final cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

The cost per razor will be $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want the costs to be equal, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for x:

"Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B, David found as D, and Lily found as L.

We know that L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David).
We also know that D = B/2 (David found half of what Bodhi found).

The total number of insects is 43, so L + D + B = 43.

Substituting the expressions for L and D in terms of B, we get:
(D + 7) + D + B = 43
(B/2 + 7) + B/2 + B = 43

Combine like terms:
B/2 + B/2 + B + 7 = 43
3B/2 + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
3B/2 = 36

Multiply both sides by 2/3:
B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:
D = B/2 = 24/2 = 12

Now that we know David found 12 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:
L = D + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19

Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh):
Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/h * 24 h = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/h * 24 h = 336 kWh

Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the usual 4 hours, the weeks with 5 hours, and the week with 6 hours.

Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks (since 2 weeks were 5 hours and 1 week was 6 hours). 
So, the total hours spent in those 5 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

For the 2 weeks with 5 hours, the total hours spent is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

For the week with 6 hours, the total hours spent is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in all the weeks: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to calculate step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

On the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

On the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Since Jame will be 27 in 5 years, in 8 years, Jame will be 27 + 3 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than this, so Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we can find the difference in their current ages: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We also know the cost of the computer and the printer. So, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is half of the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we first need to find the total number of seashells brought by the boys and the girls. 

Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is 600 + (4 * 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 3000 / 10 = 300.

"To find Anne's age, we need to first find Alyana's age. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, who is 10 years old. 

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now, we know Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. 

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8 years

1. Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. So each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.
2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11.
3. He adds another $10 the following day, making it $11 + $10 = $21.
4. He spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.
5. He triples the amount he had left after spending the $8, making it $13 * 3 = $39.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to find out how much he needs to save in total for the first and second half of the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half, let's assume the daily savings in the first half is x. Then the daily savings in the second half will be 2x.

There are 30 days in April, so the first half will have 15 days and the second half will also have 15 days.

The total savings for the first half will be 15x and the total savings for the second half will be 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total savings for the month should be $1125, so we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

Since the daily savings in the second half is 2x, the daily savings in the second half will be 2 * 25 = 50.

Cost of peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75 = $4.50

Total cost of fruits: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is the difference between $20 and the total cost of the fruits.

Change = $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

Since the question asks about hot and cold days, but the information given is about cold and warm days, we will assume that the time taken on a hot day is the same as the time taken on a warm day.

Now, we need to find the time taken to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray takes 16 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, he will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, he will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

Since each crayon is worn down to small pieces, we'll assume each crayon can be divided into equal small pieces. However, the exact number of small pieces per crayon isn't given. 

We do know that 8 small pieces of crayons are needed to make one muffin crayon. So, we'll divide the total number of small pieces by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons.

We can simply divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons needed to make one muffin crayon (which is 8 small pieces, but we don't know how many small pieces are in one crayon, so we'll divide by the number of crayons that would give us 8 small pieces). 

Since we don't know the exact number of small pieces per crayon, let's assume each crayon can be divided into 'x' small pieces. Then, the number of crayons needed to make one muffin crayon is 8/x.

On day three, he saw 0 birds.
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds.
On day six, he saw 20 birds.
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280

"To find the total number of cards, we need to determine how many cards the brother has and add that to the number of cards the boy has.

The boy has 5 cards. 
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so the brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Difference = Actual temperature - Set temperature
= 468 - 450
= 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will give us an actual temperature of 520 degrees, with the oven being off by 4%.

Let's call the set temperature 'x'. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

Actual temperature = x + (0.04x)
= 1.04x

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so we set up the equation:

1.04x = 520

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 1.04:

x = 520 / 1.04
= 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the total time for the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, the total time for the first movie is:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the hours to minutes:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, the total time for the second movie is:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time for both movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of utensils:
Judy's cups: 12

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes and then divide it by the total number of contacts.

1 box has 90 contacts and lasts 45 days, so 2 boxes will have 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100, but it's 10% off, so the discounted price is:
$100 - (10% of $100) = $100 - $10 = $90 per box.

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90 * 2 = $180.

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180 / 180 contacts = $1 per contact.

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost per pair is:
$1 * 2 = $2 per pair.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned. 

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 ml to find out how many ml of water she needs to drink.

8 * 100 = 800 ml.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Since the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B. The jar also contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now we can find the number of red jelly beans (0.99B) and the number of green jelly beans (1.01B):

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

Now, we can calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms:
200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day

1. Let Jerry's current age be x.
2. Five years ago, Jerry's age was x - 5.
3. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)
4. Simplify the equation: x = 2x - 10
5. Subtract x from both sides: 0 = x - 10
6. Add 10 to both sides: 10 = x

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he bought each year and add the games he received for his birthday and Christmas.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 22 + 29 = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 51 + 53 = 104 games.

"To find the amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour, we divide 120 pounds by 2 hours. 
Ruiz makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. 
However, we need to compare it to Ruiz's hourly production, so we calculate 3/4 of Ruiz's hourly production.
Marissa makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, we calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours.
Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find the number of rotations per mile, we divide the number of rotations by the number of miles: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile.

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the number of rotations per month is:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month.

To find the number of rotations per year, we multiply the number of rotations per month by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year.

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings. 

Since the bottle gives 120 washings with 2 pumps, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

Now, we can find the cost of each pump. The cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is 2400 cents. 

Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = 2400 cents / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = 10 cents

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. The total cost would be 20 * $20 = $400. She got $2 off, so the final price is $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and Sheila bought 20 pomegranates. The total cost would be 20 * $30 = $600. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. The final price is $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to find the sales from green hats. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

Sales from red hats = 1/2 * Sales from green hats
400 = 1/2 * Sales from green hats
Sales from green hats = 400 * 2
Sales from green hats = 800

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

Total amount she made in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
Total amount she made in two months = 1200 + 900

We can solve the second equation for 'g' in terms of 's':
g = 20 - s

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation:

"To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by the students.

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty has 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta has 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls, we multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is the same as 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys per class

"To find the number of slices remaining, let's break down the steps:

1. Mara added 3 slices to the 2 slices already on the plate, so she had 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
2. Mara tripled the number of slices, so she had 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
3. Mara ate 2 slices, so she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
4. Her friend stole 5 slices, so Mara had 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to find the total number of animals and divide it by the number of days in a week.

Total number of animals = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses) = 28

Number of days in a week = 7

Animals groomed per day = Total number of animals / Number of days in a week
Animals groomed per day = 28 / 7

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. 
The original cost per tomato was $.5, so the original daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.
The new cost per tomato is $.4, so the new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is $250 - $200 = $50.
The weekly savings is $50 * 7 = $350.

"To find the number of groups needed, we first need to find the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students and 6 groups, we divide 54 by 6 to get 9 students per group.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we can find the total number of students required by multiplying 9 students per group by 12 groups, which is 108 students. However, we are not asked for the number of students, but rather the number of groups.

Since we already have 6 groups, and we need 12 groups, we subtract 6 from 12 to get the number of additional groups needed.

6 (initial groups) to 12 (required groups) is an increase of 6 groups.

- 100 chairs/day * 2 weekend days = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week = 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

There are 8 weeks in two 4-week months. 
Total chairs rented in 8 weeks = 500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for 9 large buttons (since 3 small stickers = 1 large button).

Now she has 3 small stickers left and 40 large stickers.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 20 large buttons, and 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 20 large buttons, and 60 small buttons.

She also had 9 large buttons from the first trade. So in total, she has 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons.

Since 1 large button = 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons for a total count. 29 large buttons = 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

Adding the 60 small buttons and 3 small stickers (which are worth 3 small buttons), we get 87 + 60 + 3 = 150 small buttons.

Since 1 large button = 3 small buttons, we can convert the total small buttons to large buttons and small buttons. 150 / 3 = 50 large buttons.

However, we already know she has 29 large buttons. The rest are small buttons. 150 - (29 * 3) = 150 - 87 = 63 small buttons.

So she has 29 large buttons and 63 small buttons.

The total number of buttons is 29 (large buttons) + 63 (small buttons) = 92 buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either in favor or against. Therefore, the total number of votes is also 33.

Since the total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, we can write the equation:

Combine like terms:
3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is 2x.

We know that he bought a total of 17 fish, so x + 2x = 17.

Combine like terms: 3x = 17.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 17/3, but since x must be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a fish), we can try x = 5 and 2x = 10, and 5 + 10 = 15, which is close to 17, but not exactly. However, if we try x = 5 and 2x = 10, and add the original 4 white fish and 3 orange fish, we get 9 white fish and 13 orange fish, which is not twice as many orange fish as white fish. 

However, if we try x = 5 and 2x = 10, and add the original 4 white fish and 3 orange fish, and then add 2 more orange fish to make 17, we get 9 white fish and 15 orange fish, which is not twice as many orange fish as white fish. But if we try x = 5 and 2x = 12, and add the original 4 white fish and 3 orange fish, we get 9 white fish and 15 orange fish, which is not twice as many orange fish as white fish. 

However, if we try x = 4 and 2x = 8, and add the original 4 white fish and 3 orange fish, and then add 5 more fish, we get 8 white fish and 11 orange fish, which is not twice as many orange fish as white fish. But if we try x = 4 and 2x = 8, and add the original 4 white fish and 3 orange fish, and then add 5 more orange fish to make 17, we get 8 white fish and 16 orange fish, which is twice as many orange fish as white fish.

However, we can also try x = 5 and 2x = 10, and add the original 4 white fish and 3 orange fish, and then add 2 more orange fish and 5 more fish to make 17, we get 9 white fish and 15 orange fish, which is not twice as many orange fish as white fish. But if we try x = 5 and 2x = 10, and add the original 4 white fish and 3 orange fish, and then add 7 more orange fish to make 17, we get 9 white fish and 20 orange fish, which is more than twice as many orange fish as white fish.

In a week, Andy drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the twenties and the quarters separately, then add them together.

The amount spent from the quarters is 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

The amount spent from the twenties is 3/5 of 10 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount spent from the twenties is:
3/5 * 10 * $20 = 3/5 * $200 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get, we need to calculate the yield from both tomato and eggplant plants.

Tomato plants yield 22 tomatoes each, and Ricardo has 5 plants, so the total number of tomatoes is 22 * 5 = 110.

Eggplant plants yield 4 eggplants each, and Ricardo has 8 plants, so the total number of eggplants is 4 * 8 = 32.

The total number of fruits is the sum of tomatoes and eggplants, which is 110 + 32 = 142.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the total TVs sold are smart TVs. Since they sold 40 TVs, the number of smart TVs sold is 40 * (1/4) = 10.

One-eighth of the total TVs sold are analog TVs. The number of analog TVs sold is 40 * (1/8) = 5.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold. 

Number of OLED TVs sold = Total TVs sold - (Number of smart TVs sold + Number of analog TVs sold)
= 40 - (10 + 5)
= 40 - 15

Cost of the trip: $300
School's contribution: $300 / 2 = $150

Now, we know that John has $50. To find out how much he is missing, we subtract the school's contribution and John's money from the total cost of the trip:

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find out the temperature at night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to at least 32 degrees. 

To find out how many degrees the house needs to be heated, we subtract the temperature at night from the minimum required temperature: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since every log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the total degrees needed by 5 to find out how many logs are required: 20 / 5 = 4.

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Now, we need to find the total number of seashells brought back by the members of these 6 groups. Since each group has 9 members and each member brought back 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group and then by the number of seashells per member.

6 * 9 * 2 = 108

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months. 

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) + 20 (new employees in the second month) + 20 (new employees in the third month)
= 200 + 20 + 20 + 20
= 200 + 60
= 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month is:
260 employees * $4000 per employee
= $1,040,000 per month

Since we need to find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:

Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his salary $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his current salary $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:

(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Half an hour per day for 14 days is 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. 
2 hours per day for 7 days is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours. 
So, Kris still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth graders', so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80%. 
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700
Total number of students who took the test: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students who took the test, multiplied by 100 to convert to a percentage: (700 / 1000) * 100 = 70%

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate how much he has produced in the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production in the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, the production in the fourth week is:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, and costs $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, but the initial installation only includes 4, so she needs 2 additional mirrors. 
She has 2 chandeliers, but the initial installation only includes 1, so she needs 1 additional chandelier.
She has 20 pictures, but the initial installation only includes 10, so she needs 10 additional pictures.

The total number of additional items is 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The total cost is the cost of the initial installation + the cost of the additional items = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay, Kagiyami, and then Naruto can lift a mountain.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To find out how many more liters he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we divide the additional liters needed by the liters per cow: 10 / 5 = 2.

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is used and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. 
1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm used.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. 
1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm used.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the total original length minus the total used length. 
3 * 12 mm = 36 mm (total original length)

We also know that your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age. Let's denote your mom's age as M. 
M = 3B - 1

When you add all your ages, you get 87. 
Y + B + S + M = 87

Now, let's substitute the expressions for Y and M into the last equation: 
(B - 3) + B + (Y - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Since Y = B - 3, we can substitute (B - 3) for Y in the equation (Y - 2):

Combine like terms: 
(B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine B terms:

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Paul initially had 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.25 (since 1/4 = 0.25). 
   80 * 0.25 = 20
   So, he lost 20 marbles.
4. Now, subtract the marbles he lost from the total marbles he had after receiving the gift.
   80 - 20 = 60

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scores in each type of question and then add them up.

Multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points.

True/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points.

Long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correct. Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 300 is (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens.

He plans to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken, so he will make 180 * $50 = $9000.

However, he wants to make a profit of $2000, so the cost price of the chickens must be $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

The original rope is 20 meters long and is sold for $2 per meter. 
The total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the rope is 20 * 2 = $40.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. Since Sarah is buying a new rope of the same length (20 meters), the cost of the new rope is 20 * 1.5 = $30.

The profit Sarah makes from selling the rope is $40, and she spends $30 on the new rope. 
The amount of money she has left over is 40 - 30 = $10.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart.

The 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since the 6 packets of chicken each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. The total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

The 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

The 7 packs of apples each cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. The total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has $65 - $60 = $5 left in her budget.

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, we can assume that's for one mowing. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times, which would be 3 * $6 = $18.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once for $6, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times, which would be 5 * $6 = $30.

Now, let's add up the money she made from mowing lawns: $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54.

He saw 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each, so 8 * $7 = $56.
He had 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost $8 each, so 2 * $8 = $16.
He had 4 boxes of candy, which cost $2 each, so 4 * $2 = $8.

Total money spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

He has $150 for the month, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to get a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) tonight, he will spend $8 + $2 = $10 on snacks. This leaves him with $20 - $10 = $10 for a movie ticket.

Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10, which is exactly what he has left. He can see 1 more movie.

"To find the total calories of the mini pastries, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, which is 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from the blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from all the pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. 
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 * 2 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.
Number of days = 5.

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60.

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the bus: Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles
For the car: Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, let's find the difference in distance:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
= 300 miles - 240 miles
= 60 miles

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and Jean's (also referred to as John) age as J.

We know that:
1. P + L + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old)
2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute L from equation 2 into equation 3:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute P and L from the above equations into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find L:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10
L = 30

Now that we know L and J, we can find P:
P = L + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the number of balloons each person had initially and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Maria's friends had 2 balloons each, and there were 4 friends, so they had 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. 
Maria had 1 balloon. 
So initially, they had 8 + 1 = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There were 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so they received 5 * 3 = 15 more balloons.

The total number of balloons is 9 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 24.

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. 
In 24 hours, it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets.
In 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.
In 24 hours, it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets.
In 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month:
Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets * $6 = $259200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets * $6 = $194400

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

To find the amount of hay needed for the sheep, we first need to find out how much each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. 
Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than that is 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

Now, we multiply the number of sheep by the amount each sheep needs: 
12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the amount needed for the sheep: 
75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

She gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gives away is:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he saved with the discount, and the amount he got back from selling the CDs.

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got a 40% discount, he saved 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He sold 5 CDs for $40, but we need to find out how much he paid for those 5 CDs. Since he paid $90 for 10 CDs, the cost per CD is $90 / 10 = $9. He sold 5 CDs, so he paid 5 * $9 = $45 for them.

He got $40 for the 5 CDs, so he lost $45 - $40 = $5 on those CDs.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + D = 45.

Also, since B = D + 10, we can substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (D + 10) + D = 45.

Now we have two equations: 
A + (A + 20) + D = 45 
A + (D + 10) + D = 45

Simplifying the first equation, we get 2A + D + 20 = 45. 
Simplifying the second equation, we get A + 2D + 10 = 45.

Now we have two simplified equations:
2A + D + 20 = 45 
A + 2D + 10 = 45

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the first equation, we get 2A + D = 25.
Subtracting 10 from both sides of the second equation, we get A + 2D = 35.

Now we have two simplified equations:
2A + D = 25 
A + 2D = 35

Multiplying the second equation by 2, we get 2A + 4D = 70.

Now we have two simplified equations:
2A + D = 25 
2A + 4D = 70

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get 3D = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get D = 15.

Now that we know D, we can substitute D in the equation B = D + 10 to get B = 15 + 10 = 25.

Now that we know B, we can substitute B in the equation B = A + 20 to get 25 = A + 20.

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get A = 5.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to find the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players in Zeke's team + Number of players in Carlton's team
= 20 + 13

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first find out how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the number of oranges she gave away and kept.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away:
4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is:
1/4 * 160 oranges = 40 oranges

So, she sold the rest of the oranges, which is:
160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then subtract the amount he has already saved.

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14, he still needs $39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5).

$25 / $5 = 5 hours

"To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. 

So, Jerry has 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. 

So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes sold for each item and then multiply by the cost.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for each item:
Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
Apple pie: 26 boxes * $15 = $390

Total earnings: $150 + $390 = $540

"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use during her vacation.

She reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day. So, she will use 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.

Since she will be on vacation for 8 days, she will use a total of 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces):

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car: $100
40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40
Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - $40
Price of the red car = $100 - $40
Price of the red car = $60

Total cost of both cars = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost of both cars = $100 + $60
Total cost of both cars = $160

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age at that time will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, and he will be 24 in 5 years, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. This means his brother's age at that time will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, and he will be 24 in 5 years, his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. 
The sum of their ages is 43 + 7 = 50.

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5 = 25

Now, we add Charlie's and Sophie's shoe sizes and divide by 2 to find the average.

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we need to find out how many spaces of 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) plus the width of the flower (12 inches) we can fit in the flower bed. 

The total space required for each plant is 18 inches + 12 inches = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space required for each plant.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6, so Pat will spend:

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on low is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on high is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to first find the age of Helene. 

We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, respectively. 

So, the total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, let's denote the age of Helene as H and the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:

3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:
H + W = 13

We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 20 / 4 = 5.

So, Helene's age is twice the average age, which is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now we know Helene's age, so we can substitute it into the equation H + W = 13:
10 + W = 13

Subtract 10 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice.

Let's assume the total number of slices is 6 (2 adults and 4 kids). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as 'x' and the size of each adult's slice as '2x'.

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Since there are 4 kids and 2 adults, the total size is 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we can find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing the size of each adult's slice (2x) by the total size of the watermelon (8x) and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:

Before that, the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours, so the total loss in those 5 hours is 9% * 5 = 45%. This means that before those 5 hours, the power bank had 49% + 45% = 94% charge.

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for the down payment. 

The down payment is 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10,000. 
20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total hourly income, which is the sum of her wages and tips.
$10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, her weekly income is:
$25 per hour * 40 hours per week = $1,000 per week.

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment:
$2,000 (down payment) / $1,000 (weekly income) = 2 weeks.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

3 peaches at $.5 each = 3 * .5 = $1.5
4 pears at $.5 each = 4 * .5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * 1 = $2
5 apples at $.75 each = 5 * .75 = $3.75

Total cost of fruits purchased = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the amount left for plums is $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price after 3 years is $139.

Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, we can find the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album
Number of selfies = 27

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album

First, let's find the number of easy questions: 
40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
100% - 40% = 60% of the questions are average and difficult.
60% of 60 = 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions.
36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions Aries is sure to get correct:

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since a small stuffed animal costs $4, a large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.

Teresa earned $120 from the sales. The total earnings can be represented as the sum of the earnings from large and small stuffed animals: 12L + 4S = 120.

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get: 12L + 4(2L) = 120.
This simplifies to 12L + 8L = 120, which further simplifies to 20L = 120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we get L = 6.

Since S = 2L, S = 2 * 6 = 12.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days.

"To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%.

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Since the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads for the twin beds (4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads). For the king size bed, he will need to do 1 load.

So, the total number of loads per week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year. To find the total number of loads per year, multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch per weekend and then multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, the total number of movies they watch per weekend is 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers: 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 250.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food Imma's cats eat per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that amount.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, so the total amount of food per cat per day is 60 * 2 = 120 grams. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food eaten per day is 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the total amount of food eaten per day (360 grams):

720 / 360 = 2

Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

Total slices eaten: 31"
"Let's denote Donovan's part as x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part is x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of Donovan's part and Betsy's part, which is x + (x + 18). The total time is given as 98 minutes.

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, Betsy's part is 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 0.7 = 14
Number of pizzas left from the glee club = 20 - 14 = 6

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 0.8 = 32
Number of pizzas left from the football team = 40 - 32 = 8

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we need to find a quarter of 20 trucks. 
A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks were unable to deliver the fertiliser. 
The number of trucks that were able to deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves. So, it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the initial time. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. It will leave 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after the initial time.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves. So, it arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the initial time. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, it arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the initial time.

Since Paul arrives at the initial time (0 minutes), he will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time.

There are 6 periods in a normal day, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To find the extra learning time, we need to calculate 1/16 of his weekly minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends 1/16 of this time on extra learning, which is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes per week.

However, this is the total extra time for both Saturday and Sunday. Since the question states he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday, we need to divide this by 2. So, the extra learning time per week is 630 minutes.

The total time John spends learning is 1600 + 630 = 2230 minutes per week.

Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance, we need to calculate the total amount Sheila spent after returning the item and then subtract the returned amount from the initial charge.

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: -$15.00
New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan and the towels after the discount.

Frying pan: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 (discount)
Frying pan price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Towels: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 (discount)
Towels price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Total new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

New balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

"To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color under UV light, and these are a third of the large jellyfish. So, the total number of large jellyfish is 3 times 6, which is 18.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the total number of jellyfish is 5 times 18, which is 90.

"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, and Chris is 4 years old, Ben's age is 2 * 4 = 8 years.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how many years it will take her to reach that goal.

Lauren's retirement savings goal is to live on 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years. 40% of $100,000 is $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she will need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Since Lauren is saving 20% of her current annual salary, she is saving:

$100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by the amount she is saving per year:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

Since Lauren wants to retire in 20 years, she will need to work for 40 years to reach her retirement savings goal. However, the question asks how many more years she needs to work, so we subtract the number of years she has already worked (which is not given, but we can assume she has worked for some time already). Since we don't have this information, let's assume she has worked for 0 years so far.

40 years - 0 years = 40 years

The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of Elijah's two dogs first. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs: 
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Total weight: 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 pounds

"To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards. 

Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. 

Since Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. 

Luis used half of the stickers, so Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before using half of them.

Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the large bags and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total weight of large bags = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
Total number of M&M's = 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags John can make.

Number of small bags = Total number of M&M's / Number of M&M's per small bag
= 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag
= 90 small bags

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
The average car can go 120 miles per hour. 
So, the 2nd fastest car can go 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 
So, the fastest car can go 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 

21 - 13 = 8"
"To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately and then add them together.

Weight of crayons: 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces
Weight of boxes: Since Nik has 200 crayons and he puts them into groups of 8, the number of boxes is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. 
Weight of boxes: 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Total weight in ounces: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert the total weight to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

Then, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk and add it to the time spent on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

Time spent on the beach = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 2/x minutes
Time spent on the beach is given as 40 minutes, so 2/x = 40
x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles/minute

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk:
Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (2x) miles/minute = 1 / (2 * 1/20) = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes

Total time spent on the walk = Time spent on the beach + Time spent on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

She wants to save a total of $60, so she still needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, the number of weeks she needs to save $28 is:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

The second group of 2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 * 4 = 8.

The final tree had 3 blue birds.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second mug. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the x-degree mug into his water bottle, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up an equation based on the concept of heat transfer, which states that the heat gained by one substance is equal to the heat lost by another substance. 

Since the heat gained or lost is directly proportional to the temperature and the mass (or volume, in this case, since the density of water is constant), we can set up the following equation:

(4 oz * 33°F) + (1 oz * x°F) = (5 oz * 40°F)

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 68 degrees.

Number of days in three weeks: 3 * 7 = 21

Total number of cows added in 21 days: 20 * 21 = 420
Total number of chickens added in 21 days: 10 * 21 = 210

Total number of cows after 21 days: 50 + 420 = 470
Total number of chickens after 21 days: 20 + 210 = 230

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks: 470 + 230 = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

A 10% discount on $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00. 

So, the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, to find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

It takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.

Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day. Since each bouquet costs $8, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
$56 / $8 = 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets per day is:
7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers

The total number of sunflowers sold per day is:

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to add the days for each type of scene. However, this would be incorrect as it assumes she works on one type of scene exclusively until it's done. A better approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days for each type of scene or to find the most efficient way to complete the scenes.

A more efficient way is to calculate the total number of days by finding the maximum number of days for any one type of scene and then checking if the other scenes can be completed within that time frame or less.

However, a simpler approach is to calculate the total number of days by adding the days for each type of scene and then checking if there's any overlap or if the scenes can be completed in less time.

9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days

However, this is not the most efficient way. A more efficient way is to calculate the total number of days by finding the maximum number of days for any one type of scene and then checking if the other scenes can be completed within that time frame or less.

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. 

If Lauren draws 5 large-sized picture scenes per day for 9 days, she will complete 45 large-sized picture scenes in 9 days. In the remaining time of those 9 days, she can draw 6 * 4 = 24 medium-sized picture scenes and 7 * 2 = 14 small-sized picture scenes.

Now, she has 36 - 24 = 12 medium-sized picture scenes and 49 - 14 = 35 small-sized picture scenes left.

She can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, so she will need 12 / 6 = 2 days to complete the remaining medium-sized picture scenes. In those 2 days, she can draw 7 * 2 = 14 small-sized picture scenes.

Now, she has 35 - 14 = 21 small-sized picture scenes left.

She can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day, so she will need 21 / 7 = 3 days to complete the remaining small-sized picture scenes.

So, the total number of days is 9 + 2 + 3 = 14 days.

- 8-year-old tree: Let's denote the fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree as x. Then, the 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.
- 9-year-old tree: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old tree: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we know that the 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. 

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. Then Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -$3

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint that is not yellow. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple. 

The total amount of paint is 12 pints. Half of that is 12 / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint. The remaining half is also 6 pints, which is the total amount of red, white, and purple paint.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

6 / 3 = 2

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. 
Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area:

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is 12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide $1 by the cost per pod.

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
   Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home.
   The number of 20 dollar bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

4. The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = $400.

5. Thomas then triples his money.
   Tripling $400 gives 3 * 400 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.
   The number of 5 dollar bills is 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find 20% of the original 5 inches, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used each day (1 inch), but we also need to consider that the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days. Since the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to get to 2 inches. 
2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches left to use after 2 days. 
0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days, but since the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we round down to 2 days.

However, the teacher can use the chalk on the day it gets to 2 inches, so we add 1 day to the 2 days. 
2 + 1 = 3 days.

The teacher has 3 days before he has to recycle this piece.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay gains snowballs is the rate at which he builds them minus the rate at which they melt: 
1/3 - 2/15 = (5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate to find the time it will take: 
60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4

Now, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age 20 years ago:

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed on each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. 
So, the capacity of each of John's classes is 120 * 1/8 = 15 students.
Since John has 2 classes, the total capacity of his school is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The combined capacity of both schools is 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150 students.

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total amount he owes, including the interest. 

The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6. 

So, the total amount he owes is $300 + $6 = $306.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, which is 11 * 25 = $275.

Now, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month: $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we multiply the base area by the height. 
The base area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. 
The volume is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume of jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we divide the actual volume of jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans. 
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. 
The difference between the true number and the estimated number is 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people already on the bus and subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 
At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. 
So, the total number of people after the first stop is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. 
Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. 
So, the total number of people after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. 
So, the total number of people after the third stop is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the total number of people from the bus's capacity. 
200 (bus capacity) - 180 (total number of people) = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost per visit is $2. Pauline visits 3 times a year, so the cost per year is 2 * 3 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. This means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = 2 + 3 = $5 per visit. Pauline visits 3 times a year, so the cost per year is 5 * 3 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years: 30 + 45 = $75.

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speaking speed after training. 

His new speed is 2.5 times his original speed of 150 WPM. 
New speed = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM.

Since there are 450 words per page, 10 pages would be 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we can find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM.
Time = Total words / Speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

On the first day, there were 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people for the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, we add up the total number of popped kernels: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a week is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to first determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

Total number of eggs: 10 + 20 = 30

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each person and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Sarah raised $300.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each person:
$430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Aaron ran and then determine how long it took Vanessa to run twice that distance.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run half of 4 miles, which is 2 miles.

We know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa would take twice as long to run the same distance. So, if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would run 2 miles in 32 minutes.

However, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since Vanessa runs 2 miles in 32 minutes, she would run 4 miles in 64 minutes.

"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we need to multiply the length of the dock by 3, since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. 

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract that from the total amount of line he needs.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. 
Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since there are 6 reservations per night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to find the cost price of each watermelon and then calculate the selling price.

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Profit percentage = 25%
Profit amount = 25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Selling price of 1 watermelon = Cost price + Profit amount
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

"To find the answer, we need to determine the current age of John's youngest son. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

John was 19 years old when James was born, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges in an hour.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. So, Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges in an hour.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5.

"To find the cost of the radiator, we need to calculate 80% off the original price. 
80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320. 
The discount is $320, so the price Mark paid for the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The cost of the mechanic's labor is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the cost of the radiator plus the cost of the mechanic's labor: $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. So we can write:

2c + 4w = 70

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' by first multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2c + 2w = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get:

2w = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

w = 15

Now we can substitute this value back into the first equation to get:

c + 15 = 20

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

c = 5

So the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Since there are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends), we divide the total slices by 4.

Slices per person = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person
