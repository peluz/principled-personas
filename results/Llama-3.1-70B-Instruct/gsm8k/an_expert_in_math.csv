"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Number of eggs laid per day: 16
Number of eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
Number of eggs used for baking muffins: 4
Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7
Number of eggs sold: 16 - 7 = 9

Price per egg: $2
Total amount made per day: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, the $50,000 in repairs also contributed to the increased value. To find the selling price, we need to add the $50,000 to the new value of the house, which is $200,000 + $50,000 = $250,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $250,000 - $130,000 = $120,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3 sprints * 3 times a week = 3 * 3 = 9 sprints
Distance per sprint: 60 meters
Total meters per week: 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 9 * 60 = 540 meters

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses in pairs, since every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass.

The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of the first pair of glasses is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the cost of 8 pairs of glasses.

The cost of 8 pairs of glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

However, this calculation assumes that the discount applies to every second glass, not just the second glass in each pair. To get the correct answer, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses in a different way.

The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs $3. The third glass costs $5, and the fourth glass costs $3. This pattern continues.

The cost of the first 8 glasses is ($5 + $3) * 4 = $8 * 4 = $32.

The cost of the remaining 8 glasses is also $32.

The total cost is $32 + $32 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to find the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she needs to download the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the initial download time, the restart time, and the time to download the entire file: 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he was in standstill traffic, so he didn't travel any distance.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he traveled at 30 mph, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he traveled at 80 mph, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Total distance traveled in the 4 hours after turning around = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Initially, John drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he was from home when he turned around is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he traveled 135 miles in the 4 hours after turning around, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
Distance = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay separately.

Regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime pay: 5 hours (45 - 40) * 1.2 * $10/hour = 5 * $12 = $60

Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). 

The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons, which is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

Let's assume it takes x years to start earning money. The total cost will be $90 + $3x, and the total revenue will be $10.5x.

Since we want to find out when Carlos starts earning money, we set up the equation:

$10.5x = $90 + $3x

Subtract $3x from both sides:

$7.5x = $90

Divide both sides by $7.5:

x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for the total revenue to equal the total cost. However, this is the break-even point, and Carlos will start earning money after this point. Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She sold 2 more to the red house. 
So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the green and red houses is x - x/3 - 2 = (2x/3) - 2.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is ((2x/3) - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is ((2x/3) - 2) - (x/3 - 1) = x/3 - 1.

We are given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so x/3 - 1 = 5.

Solving for x, we get x/3 = 6, and x = 18.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase rate = 2.5% = 0.025
Increase in value = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
New value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Initial value = $8,000
Increase rate = 1.2% = 0.012
Increase in value = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
New value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the profit from the jewelry ($125) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit.

Profit: $125"

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Jill's total annual salary is the sum of her earnings from teaching and coaching:

"To find the total number of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of eggs she eats per week and then multiply it by 4.

There are 7 days in a week. Since Claire eats 3 eggs per day, she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

84 / 12 = 7

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the entire 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, and we started with 10 liters, but spilled 1 liter, so we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, and we have 15 liters of it. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters."
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. We can write this as:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book is $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered excluding the pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we can find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box. 

Number of boxes of pizza = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

The distance she can travel running is 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

The total number of articles she wrote in the three days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We are given that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. So, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to find the number of blue ties and the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, the number of blue ties is 200 / 40 = 5.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of a red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is 200 + 600 = $800.

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. This means she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. 

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we know the car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find the total miles Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank.

However, since the problem doesn't mention any drawn games, we'll assume they either won or lost all the games. So, W + L = 22.

We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost, so W = L + 8.

We are also given that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, 3/5 of the students are girls.

Total number of students = 200
Number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of canned tomatoes (since 64 / 2 = 32).

Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16 to get the number of cans: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to get the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12.

Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20
Cars that took an exit = 5

Cars that drove through the traffic jam = Total number of cars - Cars that took an exit

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants initially. She also received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of plants she has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 plants.

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we can find the total number of doorbell rings by adding the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

Total pages = 39

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total pages to find the remaining pages.

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read
Remaining pages = 39 - 15
Remaining pages = 24

Now, we need to find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day. He has 4 more days to complete his reading.

Average pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days
Average pages per day = 24 / 4

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box.

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

The inner volume of each box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours. 

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, the number of episodes is 90 / 30 = 3.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

"To find the total amount of water the boat took on, we need to find the total distance Julia rowed and then calculate the amount of water taken on.

First, we find the rate at which Julia rows: 
Distance = 20 feet, Time = 16 seconds
Rate = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Now, we find the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore:
Time to reach shore = 64 seconds
Distance = Rate * Time = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet

Now, we find the amount of water the boat took on:
Water taken on per 10 feet = 2 liters
Total water taken on = (Water taken on per 10 feet) * (Total distance / 10)
Total water taken on = 2 liters * (80 feet / 10)
Total water taken on = 2 liters * 8
Total water taken on = 16 liters

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:

Jamal's phone capacity = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity
1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity

Now, divide both sides by 6 to find Brittany's phone capacity:
Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

It is given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks as 'x'. Then we can set up the equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * x

"To find the profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

Cost price of 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards = 10 * $10 = $100
Cost price of 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards = 5 * $16 = $80
Total cost price = $100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.
Selling price of 10 (2 x 4 x 10) boards = 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150
Selling price of 5 (4 x 4 x 10) boards = 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120
Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270

On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = x + (0.3 * x)
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769. Since her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume her salary also increased by 40% (although the problem doesn't explicitly state this, it's a reasonable assumption given the context).

New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into Q + B + W = 700, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W: W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate the total hours he spends playing video games in a week and multiply it by his hourly wage.

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he spends playing video games in a week is:
2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Since Jordan earns $10 an hour, the total amount of money he would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working is:
14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week

Non-food items:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total cost of non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Applying 10% tax to non-food items:
Tax amount: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1
Total cost of non-food items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Total cost of all items: $5 (food) + $11 (non-food) = $16

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

"To find the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive. 
In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees returned, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after 12 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still outside the hive.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. This is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, the total number of bees outside the hive is 15 (from the first 12 hours) + 60 (from the last 6 hours) = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This means all 75 bees return.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.
The total cost of the tickets is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost of the tickets to find out how much she gave the cashier.

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

"To find the number of Facebook friends James has, we need to first find the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:
James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find out how long the winner will be waiting, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

Waiting time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find the initial number of french fries, let's work backwards from the end.

1. Ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind, so there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants.

2. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so the raccoon stole 2/3 of the total, and 1/3 remained. Let's call the total number of fries before the raccoon 'x'. Then, 1/3 * x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 6 * 3 = 18.

3. Before the raccoon, there were 18 fries. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. So, before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

4. Before the pigeons, a seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, the total hours for these days are 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, the total hours for these days are 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards each way). So, Kelly ran 200 + (34 x 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake ran the most. To find out how much farther Blake ran, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of votes by 3/4.

Total number of votes = 80
Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

Loser's votes = Total number of votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

"To find the number of red roses Sandra ordered, we first need to find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. 

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. We are given that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. 

Number of red roses = 4 * number of white carnations

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

Since Jan is 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Now, Mark's current age would be 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age would be 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4x400 meter relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So, the times for the 4 runners are:
60, 57, 54, 51 seconds

The total time taken by this team is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling an even number on the second roll. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 0.25.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage. The difference is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we can find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by subtracting the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. This is 140 - 50 = 90.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by 6. This is 90 / 6 = 15.

We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. So, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by 3. This is 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The cost price per bag is $20, and the transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

The selling price per bag is $30.

The profit per bag is the selling price minus the total cost per bag, which is $30 - $22 = $8.

The total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 8:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. The amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16, and the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, we can set up the equation:

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first find the total number of cards and the number of water type cards after James loses 8 and buys 14 grass type cards.

Initial number of cards: 
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Total number of cards: 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Now, we can find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
(Water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to first determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Now, we add the number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute: 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute: 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 60 / 60 = 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To find the number of melons not ready for harvest after two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons left after Ashlyn's two visits.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons.

So, Ashlyn took 36 melons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 is (3/4) * 84 = 63 melons.

Ashlyn harvested 63 melons, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 melons.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21.

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate his total weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, his weekly consumption is:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. So, their combined weekly consumption is:

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide their combined weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Ram starts with 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he can make new pens by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens. 

So, from the initial 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

However, the 5 new pens will also run out of ink eventually. When they do, he can make 1 more pen from the 5 empty pens.

So, he now has 30 - 5 (empty pens) + 1 (new pen) = 26 pens.

This process can continue, but the number of new pens he can make will keep decreasing. 

From the 25 initial pens, he can make a total of 25 / 5 = 5 new pens in the first round, then 5 / 5 = 1 new pen in the second round, then 1 / 5 = 0.2 (but he can't make a fraction of a pen, so he can't make any more pens after the second round).

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens in the first round) + 1 (new pen in the second round) = 31 pens.

"To find out how many more candies John has than James, we need to first find out how many candies Robert and James have.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54

where x is the number of candies Robert has.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 27

So Robert has 27 candies.

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, James has:

"To find the number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes.

Initially, Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page. So, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the total time Mike spends writing a week is 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.

Before Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had 29 + 10 = 39 fries.

Kyle took 5 fries, so before Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had 39 + 5 = 44 fries.

Griffin started with 24 fries, so Ginger gave Griffin 44 - 24 = 20 fries.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate a total of 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories Sue consumed: 46 cookies * 200 calories = 9200 calories.

Her sister consumed 18 cookies * 200 calories = 3600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories her sister consumed from the calories Sue consumed: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house, then multiply by the number of houses.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the number of windows in the bedrooms per house is 3 * 2 = 6.

Adding the 4 additional windows in each house, the total number of windows per house is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 10 * 2 = 20.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, and the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches. 
Collar stitches = 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
Rosette stitches = 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the total stitches for the sleeves.
Total stitches for sleeves = 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the stitches for each sleeve.
Stitches for each sleeve = 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are his lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are his lines, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, we add the lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write the equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, substitute R = 6S into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expand the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

Sam is currently 6 years old."

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

76 (total stars) - 36 (stars in 8-star and 6-star rows) = 40 stars

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, divide the total number of stars in 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, the car in the slow lane is traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles, we can find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance by dividing the distance by the speed of the car in the slow lane.

time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

It is given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have.

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 * 39 = 390.

4 adults get 6 chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars the adults get is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so we subtract that from the total time: 
3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes:

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find the total amount of rice consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can divide the total weight of the rice bag (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

Number of pieces of paper = Total number of pages / 2

We know that O = 2D (twice as many players on the offense as on the defense) and S = D/2 (half the number of players on the special teams as on the defense).

The total number of players is 105, so we can set up the equation: O + D + S = 105.

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D, we get: 2D + D + D/2 = 105.

Combine like terms: 2D + D + 0.5D = 105.

Combine the D terms: 3.5D = 105.

Divide both sides by 3.5: D = 30.

The number of players on the defense is 30."
"To find the total number of people who were initially invited, we need to calculate the number of people from each type of family and add them together.

Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24

Now, we need to subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments.
8 people couldn't come due to illness.
1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments: 8 * 1/4 = 2
Total people who couldn't come: 8 + 2 = 10

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Initially, Solomon had 50 marbles in the store. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles becomes 50 + 20 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156.

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (pole) / 3 (wires) = x (poles) / 45 (wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3 * x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

1/4 of the total number of people left, so the number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, we first need to find out how many pencils Jam has in her boxes. We know Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, and a total of 26 pencils. 

Let's subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total to find out how many pencils are in the boxes: 
26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since there are 3 boxes, we can divide the total pencils in the boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold:
24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we know the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have: 
26 (Jam) + 46 (Meg) = 72 pencils.

To find out how many boxes they need, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

Since 5 people left with 7 new records, we divide 7 by 5 to get the average number of new records per person. 7 / 5 = 1.4. 

Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, we multiply the average number of new records per person by 2 to get the average number of old records per person. 1.4 * 2 = 2.8.

Now, we multiply the average number of old records per person by the total number of people to get the total number of old records. 2.8 * 5 = 14.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month. The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people becomes x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people becomes (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. Then, 8 more people got in, making the total number of people x - 2 + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. So, we can set up the equation x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 6 = 14.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 minutes to fully charge.

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of pairs sold each day to find the total number of pairs sold:

40% of the equipment is faulty, so the amount spent on faulty equipment is 40% of $400,000. 
40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Now, to find the amount spent on functioning equipment, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent on equipment.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30.
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600.
The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

For the taffy, Sally bought 2 pounds. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

The total amount Sally spent is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework.

The first package costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, add the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events.

First, let's find the number of candles that will explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% will explode. 

Number of candles that will explode = 1% of 50000
= 0.01 * 50000
= 500

Next, let's find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. 5% of the candles have this defect.

Number of candles that will smell like wet dog = 5% of 50000
= 0.05 * 50000
= 2500

Now, we need to find the intersection of the two events. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities.

Probability of a candle exploding and smelling like wet dog = Probability of a candle exploding * Probability of a candle smelling like wet dog
= 0.01 * 0.05
= 0.0005

Number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode = 0.0005 * 50000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount (30/2 = 15) from the shortest trees.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees (2 * 30 = 60) and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees (3 * 15 = 45).

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x.

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 + 45 = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation:

45 + x + 105 = 500

Combine like terms:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 350."
"Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
c = 124

Now, we can substitute c = 124 into the first equation to find d:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since Bill is signing up for 2 years (24 months), we subtract the introductory period (6 months) and the increased rate period (which we'll calculate later) from the total months. Since 2 years is 24 months, and the introductory period is 6 months, that leaves 24 - 6 = 18 months. However, 8 months of that is at the normal rate, so the remaining months at the increased rate is 18 - 8 = 10 months. The cost of the normal rate period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is 10 months at $14 per month, so the cost is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the three periods:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Since the jogger jeans cost $22 and he saved $2, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.

Since the tattered jeans cost $28 and he saved $4, the original price of the tattered jeans was $28 + $4 = $32.

Since he sold each card for $1.5, the number of cards he sold is $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

We know that Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of his total cards. Let's call the total number of cards 'x'. Then, 2/3 * x = 100.

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2: x = 100 * (3/2) = 150.

When 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed would be 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short would be 80 - 54 = 26.

Since each guest who didn't get a second hotdog would be short one hotdog, the number of guests who didn't get a second hotdog would be 26.

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 for rubies, so she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of the 2 rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds and then divide it by the volume of each bag of potting soil.

The volume of each raised bed is 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.
Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume is 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost is 160 bags * $12 = $1920.

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots:
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100

We are also given that L + D + B = 43 (Together they collected 43 insects).

Substituting D = B/2 into L = D + 7, we get L = B/2 + 7.

Now, substituting L = B/2 + 7 and D = B/2 into L + D + B = 43, we get:

"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to first find the total cost of the other two packs of gum. 

The cost of the grape gum is $2. 
The cost of the green apple gum is half the cost of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in all, the total cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

For 2 x 4 wood: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
For 2 x 8 wood: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

Since 2 x 8 wood gives more sticks per dollar, we'll use that. However, we need to check if Frederick can afford the 2 x 8 wood.

Frederick has $24. The cost of one 2 x 8 piece of wood is $6. The maximum number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy is $24 / $6 = 4.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of sticks he can make: 4 * 400 = 1600.

However, we also need to check if buying 2 x 4 wood would give more sticks. The cost of one 2 x 4 piece of wood is $4. The maximum number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy is $24 / $4 = 6.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of sticks he can make: 6 * 200 = 1200.

Since 1600 is more than 1200, we can confirm that buying 2 x 8 wood gives the most sticks.

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost, we need to determine the number of snowshoes needed and multiply it by the cost per pair. 

Each dog has 4 legs, but each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs. So, each dog needs 2 pairs of snowshoes (4 legs / 2 legs per pair = 2 pairs). 

Mario has 6 dogs, so the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed is 6 dogs * 2 pairs per dog = 12 pairs.

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Multiply the total number of pairs by the cost per pair: 12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, 5 days a week, so the total number of bus trips per week is:
2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is:
10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00

The cost of the weekly bus pass is $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

"To find the total number of animals, we need to determine the number of cows at the zoo and the number of sheep at the farm.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's count the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and zoo combined is 40 + 80 = 120.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to find her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

Daily consumption before adding the new device: 12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after adding the new device: 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Weekly consumption before adding the new device: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after adding the new device: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. We multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt-hour to get the weekly electric bill.

Weekly electric bill before adding the new device: 2016 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3024
Weekly electric bill after adding the new device: 2352 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3528

So, one person can paint half a house in 120 hours.

Since we want to know how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to consider that 5 people can paint 5 times as fast as one person. However, painting a whole house is twice as much work as painting half a house. 

So, if one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, 5 people can paint a whole house in:

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. So, if we let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 400

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 398

The number of toys Jonathan currently has is 398."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of the items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost:
10% of $30 = 0.10 x $30 = $3

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"

"To find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile in warm water, we need to calculate 2 minutes more than twice as long as his time in cold water. 

Twice as long as his time in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 
2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long Ray takes to swim 3 miles in cold and warm water. 

In cold water, Ray takes 16 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, he takes 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile. So, to swim 3 miles, he takes 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

So James needs 4 packs of candles. The total cost will be the number of packs multiplied by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total time she spent reading is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years. 

Shiloh's age in 7 years = 44 + 7 = 51 years

Since Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew in 7 years, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let x be the nephew's age in 7 years.

51 = 3x

To find the nephew's age in 7 years, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3.

x = 51 / 3
x = 17

Now, we need to find the nephew's current age. Since we know the nephew's age in 7 years, we can subtract 7 from this value to find his current age.

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature = 450
Actual temperature = 468
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will give an actual temperature of 520 degrees, with the same 4% error.

Let x be the set temperature. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

Actual temperature = x + (0.04x)

Day 3: 16 feet (doubled from 8 feet)
Day 4: 32 feet (doubled from 16 feet)

Since the window is 20 feet off the ground, the beanstalk needs to be at least 20 feet tall to be taller than the window. On Day 3, the beanstalk is 16 feet, which is still shorter than the window. However, on Day 4, the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is taller than the window.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find the amount of protein John gets per day, we need to calculate the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms and then multiply it by the amount of mushrooms he eats per day.

Protein per gram of mushrooms = 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams/gram
Protein per day = 0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams

To find the amount of protein John gets per week, we multiply the amount of protein he gets per day by 7.

Protein per week = 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:
10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
Adding the extra cost for the porcelain crown, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the largest angle, which is 3x:

3x = 3(30) = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = 345 / 5 = 69

First, we calculate the 50% increase: 
50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

Now, we add the 50% increase to the original weight:
8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, Jamaal uses a weight 2 pounds lighter:
12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he bought each year and add the games he received for his birthday and Christmas.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 22 + 29 = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 51 + 53 = 104 games.

"To find the amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour, we divide 120 pounds by 2 hours. 
Ruiz makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. 
However, we need to compare it to Ruiz's hourly production, so we calculate Marissa's production as 3/4 times Ruiz's hourly production.
Marissa makes (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, we calculate the amount of chocolates they make together in an hour.
Together, they make 60 + 45 = 105 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

To find the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours, we multiply their hourly production by 12.
Total chocolates made = 105 * 12 = 1260 pounds.

The total earnings from the first 4 hours are 60 * $0.50 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
So, in 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups.
The total earnings from the next 2 hours are 20 * $0.60 = $12.

The total earnings from 6 hours are $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find the total number of rotations per month, we need to multiply the number of rotations per 2 miles by the number of 2-mile intervals in 400 miles. 

400 miles / 2 miles = 200 intervals
200 intervals * 725 rotations/interval = 145,000 rotations/month

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per year is:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:
$60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax. The total cost of the outfit is $42.

Now, we subtract the cost of the outfit from Joe's initial $50:

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The cost for the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45) is 50% more than the initial funding per month. To find the cost per month for the remaining months, we need to calculate 50% of the initial funding and add it to the initial funding.

50% of $100,000 is $50,000. Adding this to the initial funding, we get $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month for the remaining months.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend while keeping the cost per class below $10.

Total cost of classes: $60
Maximum cost per class: $10
Total classes: 10

Let's assume Manny attends 'x' classes. The cost per class will be the total cost divided by the number of classes attended.

Cost per class = Total cost / Number of classes attended
$10 = $60 / x

To find the minimum number of classes Manny must attend, we can rearrange the equation:

x = $60 / $10
x = 6

This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class below $10. If he attends 6 classes, the cost per class will be exactly $10.

To find the number of classes Manny can miss, we subtract the number of classes he must attend from the total number of classes:

"To find the total cost of the truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.
The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
The towing package is not given a price, so we will assume it is $0 for this calculation.
The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $0 (towing package) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $43,500.

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. 
3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time for nap = 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 
The total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20. 
So, the cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 
The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.
10 candies cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.
The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to find out how many coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we need to find the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.
Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, and the dog needs 2 vaccines, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

The price of one banana is twice the price of an apple, so it's 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The price of an orange is three times the price of a banana, so it's 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

"To find the total number of chairs needed, we need to add the number of adults and babies. 
Total number of people = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is:
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40

Total number of chairs available = 40 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 48 chairs

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of people:
Number of chairs needed = 57 people - 48 chairs = 9

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students: 
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

Now, we know that the three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds. We also know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds. So, the total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul from the total weight that the three trucks combined can haul: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so her age is 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can calculate the total combined age by adding the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother: 
15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidates A and B got.

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A got 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. 50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C got by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of voters. 

Candidate C's votes = Total voters - (Candidate A's votes + Candidate B's votes)

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for 9 large buttons (since 3 small stickers = 1 large button).

Now she has 3 small stickers left and 40 large stickers.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

She has 20 large stickers left and trades them for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now she has 9 large buttons from the first trade, 20 large buttons from the second trade, and 60 small buttons from the third trade. She also has 3 small stickers left from the beginning.

Since 3 small stickers = 1 large button, we can convert the 3 small stickers to 1 large button. Now she has 9 + 20 + 1 = 30 large buttons and 60 small buttons.

Since 3 small buttons = 1 large button, we can convert the 60 small buttons to 20 large buttons. Now she has 30 + 20 = 50 large buttons.

"To find the difference between their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies and collects 'y' berries. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. Also, Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points for enemies: 
Emma: 10x
Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Points for berries:
Emma: 5y
Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Points for time:
Let's assume Emma finishes the level in 't' seconds. Since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, Ava finishes in 't - 4' seconds. 
Emma: 30t
Ava: 30(t - 4) = 30t - 120

Total points:
Emma: 10x + 5y + 30t
Ava: 10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30t - 120
Ava: 10x + 5y + 30t - 25

The difference between their scores is:
Ava's score - Emma's score = (10x + 5y + 30t - 25) - (10x + 5y + 30t)
= 10x + 5y + 30t - 25 - 10x - 5y - 30t

The difference between their scores is -25."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars (but we are told only two pizzas cost 30 dollars, so this is 30 dollars for two pizzas) 30 dollars.

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars.

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of rides for the 5 usual days and the 2 extra days separately.

For the 5 usual days, they ride 3 times a day, so the total number of rides is:
5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides

For the 2 extra days, they ride twice the usual number of times, which is 2 * 3 = 6 rides per day. The total number of rides for these 2 days is:
2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides

Now, we add the total number of rides for the usual days and the extra days:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

Since there are two people, Chase and Rider, we multiply the total number of rides by 2:
27 rides * 2 = 54 rides

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish as 'o'. We know that o + w = 17 (since he bought 17 fish in total).

Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had 3 + o orange fish and 4 + w white fish. According to the problem, he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so we can set up the equation:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
3 + o = 8 + 2w
o - 2w = 5

We also know that o + w = 17. We can solve these two equations simultaneously. Rearranging the first equation, we get:
o = 2w + 5

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
(2w + 5) + w = 17
3w + 5 = 17
3w = 12
w = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and the total amount of gas he uses.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 2 * 5 = 10 miles per day.

In a week, Andy drives a total distance of 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the twenties and the quarters separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount spent from the quarters. Since there are 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the amount spent from the twenties. Since Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, we need to find 3/5 of 10 twenties:
3/5 * 10 = 6 twenties

Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount spent from the twenties is:
6 * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the total TVs sold are smart TVs. Since they sold 40 TVs, the number of smart TVs sold is 40 * (1/4) = 10.

One-eighth of the total TVs sold are analog TVs. The number of analog TVs sold is 40 * (1/8) = 5.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold. 

Number of OLED TVs sold = Total TVs sold - (Number of smart TVs sold + Number of analog TVs sold)
= 40 - (10 + 5)

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find the temperature at night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to at least 32 degrees. 

To find out how many degrees the house needs to be heated, we subtract the temperature at night from the minimum required temperature: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since every log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the total degrees needed by 5 to find the number of logs: 20 / 5 = 4.

Now, 3/5 of the groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, we multiply the number of groups by 3/5 to get the number of groups that brought seashells.

Number of groups that brought seashells = 10 * (3/5) = 6

Since each group has 9 members and each member brought 2 seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by 9 and then by 2.

Number of seashells = 6 * 9 * 2 = 108

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the total number of employees will be:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) + 20 (new employees in month 2) + 20 (new employees in month 3)

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month is:

260 employees * $4000 per employee
= $1,040,000 per month

Since we want to find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we set up the equation:

(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Total hours played in 2 weeks = 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
Total hours played in a week = 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot before lunch break. 

Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars were added. So, the total number of cars before lunch break is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since 1/2 of the cars left during lunch break, the number of cars that remained is 1/2 of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per cycle and then multiply it by the number of cycles he does in a day.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20, so the total amount he earns per cycle is:
5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6 per cycle

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are:
$6/cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add Sasha's points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:
Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards

"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping and subtract the refund amount from the original cost of the book.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- Cost per pound: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
- Cost per mile: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
- Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

The refund amount is 75% of the original cost of the book:
- Refund amount: 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total loss:

Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate this, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to his savings.

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 * $30

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we can find the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as A, Sofie as S, and Fawn as F. 

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne) 
and A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn).

We also know that A + S + F = 85 (Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books).

Substituting S and A in terms of F in the equation A + S + F = 85, we get:
(F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) + F = 85
(F - 12) + (F + 13) + F = 85
F - 12 + F + 13 + F = 85

"To find out how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to calculate the total number of jello cups he needs and then determine how many boxes of jello he needs to buy.

Each kid will get 4 jello cups, and there are 30 kids, so the total number of jello cups needed is:
30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:
120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

The cost of jello is $1.25 per box, so the total cost will be:

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to find out how many chickens he plans to sell and how much he will make from selling them.

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. 
3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.

He plans to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken and make a profit of $2000. 
So, the total amount he will make from selling the chickens is the cost price plus the profit. 
Let's call the cost price 'x'. 
Then, the selling price is x + $2000.

The selling price per chicken is $50, so the total selling price is 180 * $50 = $9000.

Since the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit, we can set up the equation:
x + $2000 = $9000

Subtracting $2000 from both sides:
x = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

Profit = Length of rope * Price per meter
Profit = 20 * 2
Profit = 40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:
The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. Since we don't know the length of the new rope, we'll assume she buys a rope of the same length (20 meters).

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart.

The 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, so the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

The 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so the total cost of the strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

The 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. The total cost of the apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart:
$10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 
Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 
The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since the problem doesn't specify the amount paid by Kamala and Alba, we will assume that they paid the same amount per mow as Joe. 

So, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
6 (from Joe) + 6 * 3x (from Kamala) + 6 * 5x (from Alba)
= 6 + 18x + 30x
= 6 + 48x

However, we still don't know the value of 'x'. But we do know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade. 

Let's denote the amount she made from lemonade sales as 'y'. 
Then, the total amount she made is the sum of the amount she made from mowing lawns and the amount she made from lemonade sales:
6 + 48x + y = 80

We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, which means she mowed Joe's lawn at least once. 
So, x = 1 (since x cannot be a fraction, as it represents the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn).

Now, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation:
6 + 48 * 1 + y = 80
6 + 48 + y = 80

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he earns $0.20 per package, his total earnings for the day are 320 * 0.20 = 64 dollars.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on the extreme sudoku puzzle and then divide it by the time interval at which he drinks a bottle of water.

First, we find the time it takes to complete the extreme sudoku puzzle: 
Time for normal sudoku = 45 minutes
Time for extreme sudoku = 4 * Time for normal sudoku = 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks:
Number of bottles = Total time / Time interval = 180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6

"To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is:

2 pieces/red balloon * 20 red balloons = 40 pieces

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total:

58 pieces - 40 pieces = 18 pieces

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can divide the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons:

18 pieces / 3 pieces/yellow balloon = 6 yellow balloons

"To find the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a month and then divide that by the number of miles his car can go before needing a tune-up.

Total miles driven in a month = miles driven per day * number of days in the month
Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, divide the total miles driven by the number of miles his car can go before needing a tune-up:
Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven in a month / miles per tune-up
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles
Number of tune-ups = 3

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) is 12 / 2 * $0.5 = $3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they combined their allowance, the total amount they had is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total amount by 2.

$28 / 2 = $14

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of pet:
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

"To find the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells.

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and will stop at 10 years old. So, she has been collecting shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, Martha has been collecting shells for 5 * 12 = 60 months.

Since she collects one shell per month, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we subtract 15 from the total number of cups.

Total cups = 27
Cinnamon tea cups = 15
Chamomile and mint tea cups = Total cups - Cinnamon tea cups
Chamomile and mint tea cups = 27 - 15
Chamomile and mint tea cups = 12

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we divide the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups by 3 and then divide by 2 (since there are two types of tea).

Total cups per row = 12 / 3
Total cups per row = 4
Mint tea cups per row = Total cups per row / 2
Mint tea cups per row = 4 / 2
Mint tea cups per row = 2

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water

Now, we need to subtract the amount of water emptied from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the amount of water emptied will be:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank:

5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left. 

He started with $150. 
He spent $10 * 5 = $50 on Friday/Saturday movies.
He spent $7 * 8 = $56 on other day movies.
He spent $8 * 2 = $16 on popcorn.
He spent $2 * 4 = $8 on candy.

Total spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

He has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since it's a Friday, the ticket will cost $10. He also wants to get a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2), so the total cost for the night will be $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

He can spend all his remaining money, so he can see 1 more movie."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so:
600 * 1/3 = 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll

Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories of the cinnamon rolls are:
200 * 200 = 40,000 calories

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so:
450 * 1/3 = 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin

Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories of the blueberry muffins are:
300 * 150 = 45,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries are the sum of the calories of the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins:

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

"To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply its speed (60 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (5 hours). 

Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply its speed (30 miles per hour) by the time it traveled (8 hours).

Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus to find the difference.

Difference = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and Jean's (also referred to as John) age as J.

We know that P + L + J = 100.

We also know that L = J + 10.

We are also given that P = L + J.

We can substitute L from the second equation into the first equation: 
P + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 
P + 2J + 10 = 100.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 
P + 2J = 90.

Now, substitute P from the third equation into the equation above: 
(L + J) + 2J = 90.

Substitute L from the second equation into the equation above: 
(J + 10) + J + 2J = 90.

Combine like terms: 
4J + 10 = 90.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 
4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: 
J = 20.

Now that we know J, we can find L: 
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Now that we know L and J, we can find P: 
P = L + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

Maria had 1 balloon initially. 
So, the total number of balloons initially was 8 + 1 = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There were 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so they received 5 * 3 = 15 more balloons.

The total number of balloons is 9 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 24.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the total number of tables needed.

Total number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already own 15 tables, we need to subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed to find the number of new tables they need.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

"Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + D = 45.

Also, since B = D + 10, we can substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (D + 10) + D = 45.

Now we have two equations: 
A + (A + 20) + D = 45 
A + (D + 10) + D = 45

Simplifying the first equation, we get 2A + D + 20 = 45. 
Simplifying the second equation, we get A + 2D + 10 = 45.

Now we have two simplified equations:
2A + D + 20 = 45 
A + 2D + 10 = 45

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the first equation, we get 2A + D = 25.
Subtracting 10 from both sides of the second equation, we get A + 2D = 35.

Now we have two simplified equations:
2A + D = 25 
A + 2D = 35

Multiplying the second equation by 2, we get 2A + 4D = 70.

Now we have two simplified equations:
2A + D = 25 
2A + 4D = 70

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get 3D = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get D = 15.

Now that we know D = 15, we can substitute D in the equation B = D + 10 to get B = 15 + 10 = 25.

Now that we know B = 25, we can substitute B in the equation B = A + 20 to get 25 = A + 20.

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get A = 5.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She also woke up and sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. We subtract those 23 minutes from the total: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

"To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to first calculate the number of measuring spoons he has. 

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has 2 dozen cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups. 

So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the number of cups and the number of measuring spoons: 24 + 10 = 34.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we need to first calculate the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds, then calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks, and finally subtract the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 
Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

In 2 weeks, the number of new patients admitted is 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients.

Total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 (initial) + 700 (new patients) = 900 beds
Total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, so the number of emails to family is:
Emails to family = (2/3) * Non-work emails = (2/3) * 9 = 6

The remaining non-work emails are to others (not family). The number of these emails is:
Emails to others = Non-work emails - Emails to family = 9 - 6 = 3

One-third of the emails to others are to her boyfriend. The number of emails to her boyfriend is:
Emails to boyfriend = (1/3) * Emails to others = (1/3) * 3 = 1

"To find the total number of balls, we need to determine how many balls each boy carried. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Now, we can add up the number of balls each boy carried to find the total number of balls: 
Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

Total number of balls: 7"
"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the third day, and then the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

The total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is the difference between the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the total number of holes at the end of the third day. 

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, the number of Pokémon caught by Stan is 4x - 13.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon caught by Alex is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

Stan's Pokémon: 147"

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance1 = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Distance traveled in the northerly direction for 2 hours:
Distance2 = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the last 5 hours:
Distance3 = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Total Distance South = Distance1 + Distance3 = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

Since the bird traveled 36 miles in the northerly direction, we subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Total Distance = Total Distance South - Distance2 = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages:

"To find the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box: 
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 
4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges.

Now, subtract the oranges she gave away from the total: 
240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges: 
1/4 * 160 oranges = 40 oranges.

2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 2, we know that when Emil is 24, his dad's age will be 2 * 24 = 48 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, 5 years will pass before he turns 24. So, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

From point 3, we know that when Emil is 24, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, 5 years will pass before he turns 24. So, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

First, let's calculate the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6.

Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to cook 90 shrimp, we can set up a proportion.

30 shrimp / 10 minutes = 90 shrimp / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to find half of 1500 cookies.

1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine the total number of slices and the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults. There are 4 kids, so the total number of kid slices is 4x. There are 2 adults, so the total number of adult slices is 2(2x) = 4x.

The total number of slices is 4x + 4x = 8x.

Each adult gets 2x slices, so the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2x / 8x) * 100% = (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

"To find the total time spent on rounds and appointments, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required to make the cake: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we subtract the total time from the serving time:

Total number of babies born in a year = 48 * 30
Total number of babies born in a year = 1440

The total number of porcupines after a year is the sum of the initial population and the total number of babies born.

Total number of porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we need to calculate the total gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 9000 = 9000 gallons.

"To find the initial charge of the power bank, we need to work backwards. 

First, let's calculate the charge lost in the last 3 hours when the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. 

Let's assume the total capacity of the power bank is 100%. After 3 hours of losing 7% each hour, the charge remaining would be:
100% - 3 * 7% = 100% - 21% = 79%

However, we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours (5 hours of losing 9% and 3 hours of losing 7%) is 28%. This means that the charge remaining after 5 hours of losing 9% each hour is 28% / 0.79 (since 79% is the charge remaining after 3 hours of losing 7% each hour, which is equivalent to 0.79 as a decimal).

28% / 0.79 = 35.44%

Now, let's calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours when the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour.

Let's assume the initial charge is x. After 5 hours of losing 9% each hour, the charge remaining would be:
x - 5 * 9% = x - 45%

We know that the charge remaining after 5 hours is 35.44%. So we can set up the equation:
x - 45% = 35.44%

To solve for x, we can add 45% to both sides:
x = 35.44% + 45%
x = 80.44%

The final answer is: 80.44"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings and the amount she needs to save.

Janet's total hourly earnings = $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour

The down payment is 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10000. 
20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Now, we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000.

2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of fruits purchased = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the amount left for plums is $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Now, we can find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75 at $0.25 each.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation: 12L + 4(2L) = 120.

Combine like terms: 12L + 8L = 120.

There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%.

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

Since his college degree tripled his income, his new income is 3 times his previous income: 
$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

To find the number of years it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we divide the total amount of money he needs to earn by his new income: 
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the length of the fabric piece will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet.
The width of the fabric piece will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to find the area of one piece and then multiply it by 2.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area of fabric he needs is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day:
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Total amount lost = $5 (lost) - $11 (won) + $16.50 (lost) = $10.50.

Since there were 3 races, the average amount lost is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so the sum of the shares of the three people is equal to 1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Since the team worked 3/8 of a day each day, the total hours worked by the team in 21 days is:
21 days * (3/8) * 24 hours/day = 21 * 3 * 3 hours = 189 hours.

Now, divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters:

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4

Since Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week, and his laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week as follows:

- Twin beds: 4 twin beds / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads
- King size bed: 1 king set per load = 1 load

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the total time it took him to reach the store is the total distance divided by his speed: 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

"To find the amount of money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then find the difference.

Jenny bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, so she bought 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying the bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.

The cost of buying the bananas in bunches is 10 * $3.00 = $30.

The amount of money Jenny saved is $32 - $30 = $2.

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

Answer: 20"
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4 years).

Rate of growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

"To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the difference between the number of bales made by the farmer and the number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find the number of bales left in the field: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, we need to add the class time and extra learning time. However, we can calculate the extra learning time as a fraction of the total weekly minutes, which includes both class time and extra learning time. Let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x.

We know that the class time is 1600 minutes, and the extra learning time is (1/16)x. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to first determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of 12 gallons of paint is 12 * $12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a shaken soda.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas in total.

Out of the 8 remaining sodas, 2 are shaken (since 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas were taken by Ellen's brother) and 6 are unshaken.

The probability of choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas: 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%

"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:

Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he works is 80% of 50 days. 
80% of 50 days is 0.8 * 50 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

Time for the biggest slide = Length of the biggest slide / Speed of the biggest slide
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time for the biggest slide = 5 minutes

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed of the second biggest slide
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide.
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
2 15-minute breaks add up to 2 * 15 = 30 minutes. 
So, the total time for lunch and breaks per day is 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how many years it will take her to reach that goal.

Lauren's retirement savings goal is to live on 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years. 40% of $100,000 is $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she will need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Since Lauren is saving 20% of her current annual salary, she is saving:

$100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by the amount she is saving per year:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

Since Lauren wants to retire in 20 years, she will need to work for 40 years to reach her retirement savings goal. However, the question asks how many more years she needs to work, so we subtract the number of years she has already worked (which is not given, but we can assume she has worked for some time already). Since we don't have the exact number of years she has worked, let's assume she has worked for x years. 

However, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work from now to reach her goal. Since she needs to work for 40 years in total and she wants to retire in 20 years, she has already worked for 40 - 20 = 20 years.

However, we are not given the number of years she has worked, so we can't calculate the exact number of years she has worked. But we can calculate the number of years she needs to work from now to reach her goal.

Total miles to be hiked = 9,300 miles
Total days available = 30 days

Miles to be hiked per day = Total miles / Total days
Miles to be hiked per day = 9,300 miles / 30 days
Miles to be hiked per day = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, the total miles she will cover per day is:
125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we subtract the miles she will cover per day from the required miles per day:
310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

However, since she is walking twice a day, we need to divide the additional miles by 2:

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
Speed of the average car = 120 miles per hour
Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 miles per hour = 600 miles per hour

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
21 (Camden's eggs) - 13 (Arnold's eggs) = 8

"To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes separately, then add them together.

Weight of crayons: 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces
Weight of boxes: Since Nik has 200 crayons and he puts them into groups of 8, the number of boxes is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. 
Weight of boxes: 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Total weight in ounces: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert the total weight to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

Then, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is '2x' miles per minute.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. 

The time spent walking on the beach is given by distance/speed. So, 2 miles / x miles per minute = 40 minutes. This gives us x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk. The time spent walking on the sidewalk is given by distance/speed. So, 1 mile / (2x) miles per minute = 1 mile / (2 * 1/20) miles per minute = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk. So, the total time is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we can set up an equation based on the final temperature of the water in the bottle. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water into his bottle, the total amount of water is 5 ounces. 

The final temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees. We can use the concept of weighted averages to set up an equation:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees + 1 ounce * x degrees) / 5 ounces = 40 degrees

Multiply both sides by 5 ounces to eliminate the fraction:

4 * 33 + x = 5 * 40

132 + x = 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks
Total chickens = 20 + 210
Total chickens = 230

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens
Total animals = 470 + 230
Total animals = 700

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 
With a 10% discount, the cost is $40.00 - (10% of $40.00) = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, we can find the cost of each single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester will eat in 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester will eat in 60 days is:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
$26 (earnings from individual sunflowers) / $2 (cost per sunflower) = 13 sunflowers per day

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:
13 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
$56 (earnings from bouquets) / $8 (cost per bouquet) = 7 bouquets per day

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets per day is:
7 bouquets/day * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers/day

For 3 days, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets is:
84 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Since he buys 20 rocks and sells them for $7 each, the total revenue from selling all the rocks would be:

20 * 7 = 140

However, he only sells 60% of his inventory. To find out how many rocks he sells, we multiply the total number of rocks by 0.6:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks is:

12 * 7 = 84

Now, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost to find the profit or loss. The total cost is $100 (the amount he invested), and the total revenue is $84.

100 - 84 = 16

Since the result is positive, it means Adam loses money. The amount of money he loses is $16.

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided among red, white, and purple.

Total paint used = 12 pints
Yellow paint = 1/2 * 12 = 6 pints
Non-yellow paint (red, white, purple) = 12 - 6 = 6 pints

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the non-yellow paint by 3.

Red paint = 6 / 3 = 2 pints

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"To find the number of pods in the special size box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100.

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the special size box = 100 + 20 = 120

Since the special size box costs $12, the cost per pod is:
$12 / 120 pods = $0.1 per pod

To find the number of cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per pod:
$1 / $0.1 per pod = 10 cycles

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. 
He is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Since each bill is $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400.

Thomas then triples his money, so he now has 3 * 400 = $1200.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. 
Since each bill is $5, the number of 5 dollar bills is 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find 20% of the original 5 inches, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used each day (1 inch) to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days.

However, since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to get to 2 inches. 
The teacher has 2.75 inches left and uses 1 inch per day. 
2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches left to use after 2 days of using 1 inch per day (2 * 1 = 2 inches used).
Since 0.75 inches is less than 1 inch, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the 3rd day.

So, the teacher has 2 full days and part of the 3rd day before he has to recycle the chalk."

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100:

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

Total gallons of milk sold = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5 = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk.
2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons of sour milk by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount.
Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
C = 20

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices each, so they will eat 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni pizza slices in total. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay gains snowballs is the rate at which he builds them minus the rate at which they melt: 
1/3 - 2/15 = (5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate to find the time it will take: 
60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 540 / 0.15 = 3600.

However, the packing efficiency is 80%, so the actual number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 3600 * 0.8 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the true number and the estimated number, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop and then subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus is 90 * 2 = 180.

Now, to find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. So, the cost per year is 2 * 3 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = 2 + 3 = $5. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so the cost per year is 5 * 3 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is 30 + 45 = $75.

There are 4 grades (4-7) and 10 students per grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups. 

40 / 8 = 5 groups.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and after the cut, it will be divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:

b = 3c - 2

Since each person in the class gets 2 treats, the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 2 times the number of people in the class, which is 5. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write:

c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide by 4:

c = 3

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."

A 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and assuming she has 10 fingers, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, we can calculate the distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we will divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people for each day and then add them up.

On the first day, there were 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so there were 2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day, so the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people for each day:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and add them up.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of popped kernels: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

We are given that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would have taken twice as long to run the same distance. So, Vanessa would have taken 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

However, we want to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since she takes 32 minutes to run 2 miles, she would take twice as long to run 4 miles. So, Vanessa took 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to run 4 miles.

"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we need to multiply the length of the dock by 3, since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

Length of dock = 200 feet
Line needed per foot of dock = 3 feet
Total line needed = Length of dock * Line needed per foot of dock
Total line needed = 200 * 3
Total line needed = 600 feet

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract this from the total line needed to find out how much more he needs to buy.

Line needed to buy = Total line needed - Line already available
Line needed to buy = 600 - 6
Line needed to buy = 594

"To find the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total cost of the meals and wine per reservation, then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10.
Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total amount they make per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total amount they make a week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to find the cost price of each watermelon. 

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 
Cost price per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.
Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
Profit per watermelon = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit per watermelon = $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per watermelon = $2.00

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine his current age. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John was 19 years old when James was born, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 / 3 = 20 oranges

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 / 4 = 15 oranges

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:
20 - 15 = 5

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The cost of the radiator is 80% off the original price of $400. 
80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320. 
So, the discount is $320, and the price Mark paid for the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The cost of the mechanic's labor is $50 per hour for 3 hours, which is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. Since there are 20 animals in total, we can write the equation:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

2c + 4w = 70

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). To share the slices equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.

Answer: 14"
