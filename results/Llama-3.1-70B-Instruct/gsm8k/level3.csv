"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to first find out how many eggs she sells. 

She starts with 16 eggs per day. 
She eats 3 for breakfast, so we subtract 3 from 16: 16 - 3 = 13.
She bakes muffins with 4 eggs, so we subtract 4 from 13: 13 - 4 = 9.

Now, we know she sells 9 eggs per day at the farmers' market. 
She sells each egg for $2, so we multiply 9 by 2: 9 * 2 = 18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we multiply 2 by 1/2.

2 * 1/2 = 2 * 0.5 = 1

So, it takes 1 bolt of white fiber. Now, we add the amount of blue fiber and white fiber to find the total.

2 (blue fiber) + 1 (white fiber) = 3

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of the original value: 
150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

The new value of the house is the original value plus the increase in value:
New value = Original value + Increase in value
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

However, Josh also spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost for Josh is the original price of the house plus the cost of repairs:
Total cost = Original price + Cost of repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3 sprints * 3 times a week = 3 * 3 = 9 sprints
Distance per sprint: 60 meters
Total meters per week: 9 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 9 * 60 = 540 meters

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to determine the total amount of feed the chickens need in a day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day and there are 3 meals, the total amount of feed per chicken per day is indeed 3 cups. 

Since there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the full-priced glasses and the discounted glasses separately. 

Since every second glass is discounted, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2. 
- The number of full-priced glasses is 16 / 2 = 8.
- The number of discounted glasses is also 8.

The cost of the full-priced glasses is 8 * $5 = $40.
The cost of the discounted glasses is 8 * ($5 * 0.6) = 8 * $3 = $24.

The total cost is $40 + $24 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep, we need to find the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

"To find the total download time, we first need to calculate the time it took Carla to download 40% of the file before the restart. 

40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. 
Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it took to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download the entire file is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time is the sum of the initial download time, the time for the restart, and the time to download the entire file after the restart: 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 3 hours and then subtract the distance he traveled in the next 4 hours.

Distance traveled in the first 3 hours = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the next 4 hours:
- The first 2 hours were spent in standstill traffic, so the distance traveled is 0 miles.
- The next half-hour (0.5 hours) was spent driving at 30 mph, so the distance traveled is 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
- The remaining time is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours, spent driving at 80 mph, so the distance traveled is 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Total distance traveled in the next 4 hours = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

Now, subtract the distance traveled in the next 4 hours from the distance traveled in the first 3 hours to find the distance from home:
Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay and overtime pay separately.

Regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime pay: 5 hours (45 - 40) * $10/hour * 1.2 = 5 * $12 = $60

Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we add the downloads for each month to find the total: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the break-even point. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total cost of planting and maintaining the tree for 'x' years is the initial cost plus the annual maintenance cost times the number of years: 90 + 3x.

The total revenue from selling lemons for 'x' years is the number of lemons per year times the price per lemon times the number of years: 7 * 1.5 * x = 10.5x.

To find the break-even point, we set the total revenue equal to the total cost and solve for 'x':

10.5x = 90 + 3x

Subtract 3x from both sides:

7.5x = 90

Divide both sides by 7.5:

x = 12

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer is already a whole number.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as 'x'. 

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She sold 2 more to the red house. 
Then she sold half of what was left at the orange house. 

The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is x - x/3 = 2x/3. 
After the red house, she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. 
Then she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners left.

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
x/3 - 1 = 5

To solve for x, we add 1 to both sides:
x/3 = 6

Then we multiply both sides by 3:
x = 18

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance: 
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Remaining students after contemporary dance: 
20 - 4 = 16 students

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance: 
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Remaining students after jazz dance (enrolled in hip-hop dance): 
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase in value = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit from jewelry = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Initial value = $8,000
Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New value = Initial value + Increase in value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit from electronic gadgets = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the option with the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96).

Profit: $125"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distance covered on the first day (westward) to the distance covered on the second day (northward).

Distance covered on the first day: 80 miles
Distance covered on the second day: 150 miles

Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles + 150 miles

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching.

As a teacher, Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. Her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

To find Jill's total annual salary, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to determine how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats a 3-egg omelet every day, she will eat 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we will divide the total number of eggs by 12. 
84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the entire 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, the remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

The time Marissa has left to complete the remaining 6 miles is 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. Since 1 liter was spilled, we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find Raymond's current age and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can find Raymond's age by adding 6 to Samantha's age:
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

We know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:
Years ago = Raymond's current age - age when son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the DVDs sold to each group of customers and add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.
The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so they bought 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add the DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will melt, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns. 

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is 4 hours.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle got a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We can set up the equation as follows: 
0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book is $26."
"To find the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items she purchased. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the other items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of pizza by dividing the total cost of pizza by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Number of boxes of pizza: 2"

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream per night, in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings. 
Each carton has 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will buy is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as B. The cost of one pair of heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. Since the heels together cost $5 less than the boots, we can set up the equation:

B - 5 = $99

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

B = $99 + 5
B = $104

The final answer is: $104"
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's and Allen's ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x
= 11(9)
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10
= 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the guesses of the second and third friends.

The first friend's guess is 80.

The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. 
Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40. 
20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 
25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. 
20 more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have the guesses of all three friends: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add the guesses and divide by the number of friends:
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
240 / 3 = 80

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as 's' and the number of gold coins as 'g'. We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total, so we can write the equation:

s + g = 110

We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so we can write another equation:

g = s + 30

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting 's' into the second equation:

g = 40 + 30
g = 70

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to find out how much money he made from selling the lego sets. We can do this by multiplying the number of lego sets by the price of each set. 

13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Then, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. We can do this by multiplying the number of video games by the price of each game.

8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Now, we know that he has $5 left after buying the video games. So, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he has left to the money he spent on video games.

$160 (money spent on video games) + $5 (money left) = $165

Since John had $195 from selling the lego sets and he had $165 after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he spent on other things or how much he didn't make from selling the lego sets by subtracting the money he had after buying the video games from the money he made from selling the lego sets.

$195 (money made from selling lego sets) - $165 (money had after buying video games) = $30

Now, we can find out how many lego sets he didn't sell by dividing the money he didn't make from selling the lego sets by the price of each lego set.

$30 (money didn't make from selling lego sets) / $15 (price of each lego set) = 2

Since John had 13 lego sets and he didn't sell 2 of them, we can find out how many lego sets he still has by subtracting the number of lego sets he didn't sell from the total number of lego sets.

"To find John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he runs.

Distance = 60 miles per week (given)
Time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) 
Time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 
Time = 6 hours

Speed = Distance / Time 
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours 
Speed = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to find Dana's walking speed and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We are also given that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance she can travel in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours

Distance traveled while running = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, we need to subtract this from the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone to find out how far outside the reach of the flames she can stand.

Distance outside the reach of flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

"To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to first find out the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones had. 

Since she cut each pie into 8 pieces and there were 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 - 14 = 26

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and have already consumed 1800 calories. 
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for the day.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories.
200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the number of hours per article.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let x be the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. After purchasing the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She then used 220 Post-it notes at work, leaving her with 80 + x - 220 Post-it notes.

We are told that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall, so we can set up the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

To solve for x, we can add 220 to both sides of the equation:

80 + x = 23 + 220
80 + x = 243

Subtracting 80 from both sides gives us:

x = 243 - 80
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to find the number of blue ties and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:
Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can find the number of red ties by multiplying the number of blue ties by 2:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we can calculate 50% of the cost of each blue tie and add it to the cost of each blue tie:
Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:
Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total amount spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:
Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total amount spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building and then the number of occupied units.

Total number of units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4.

Number of occupied units = Total number of units * 3/4
Number of occupied units = 120 * 3/4
Number of occupied units = 90

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units - Number of occupied units
Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Number of unoccupied units = 30

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he removed. 

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books. So, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight he still needs to remove (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Now, we know the car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank.

Total distance = mpg * total capacity
Total distance = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons
Total distance = 300 miles

"To find the total hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one week, we need to calculate the hours spent per day and then multiply by 3.

Hours spent watching TV per day: 2 hours
Hours spent reading per day: 2 / 2 = 1 hour (since he reads for half as long as he watches TV)
Total hours spent per day: 2 + 1 = 3 hours
Total hours spent per week: 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week

Now, we multiply the total hours spent per week by 4 to find the total hours spent in 4 weeks:
9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours

"To find the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches from all the schools.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players per school is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 4 * 10 = 40.

Each school has 2 coaches (1 for each team), so the total number of coaches is 4 * 2 = 8.

Now, we add the total number of players and coaches to find the total number of people: 40 + 8 = 48.

Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 * 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, let's add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems.

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280

On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. 
The total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students in a week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount of money she makes in a week is 495 * 15 = 7425.

"To find the average square footage of a level, we first need to find the total square footage of the sandcastle. Since each level has half the square footage as the level below it, we can model this as a geometric series.

The top level has a square footage of 16. The second level will have twice that, or 32. The third level will have twice the second level, or 64. The fourth (bottom) level will have twice the third level, or 128.

The total square footage is the sum of the square footage of each level: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128.

This is a geometric series with the first term (a) equal to 16 and the common ratio (r) equal to 2. The sum of a finite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 16 * (1 - 2^4) / (1 - 2)
S = 16 * (1 - 16) / (-1)
S = 16 * (-15) / (-1)
S = 16 * 15
S = 240

The total square footage is 240. To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

Average square footage = Total square footage / Number of levels
= 240 / 4

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. 
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy will eat 2 cups/day for the rest of the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days.
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, let's add the amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first 180 days and the rest of the year.
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Now, let's divide the total amount of dog food by the amount of dog food in one bag to find out how many bags Cecilia will use in the first year.
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

"To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to first find out how much laundry each of them does.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing 400 by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do by subtracting David's laundry from Raymond's laundry.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry = 200 - 100 = 100

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the unit price of each package.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the unit price is:
$2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.833 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the unit price is:
$1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.833 per flower, the better price is the package of 2 flowers for $1.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
9 packages * $1 per package = $9

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the other price:
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

Combine like terms:

2l + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

Let's denote Amy's age as A, Jackson's age as J, Corey's age as C, and James' age as M (which we already know is 10).

From the information given, we have the following equations:

1. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
2. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
3. M = C - 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)
4. M = 10 (James is 10 years old)

We can substitute the value of M from equation 4 into equation 3 to find C:

Marcell's roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

The total number of roll-ups eaten by both is 48 + 42 = 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups eaten by 2 (the number of people eating). 

Average = 90 / 2 = 45

"To find the total distance Julia rowed, we need to calculate the distance she covered in 64 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can set up a proportion to find the distance she rows in 1 second.

Distance in 16 seconds = 20 feet
Distance in 1 second = 20 / 16 = 1.25 feet

Now, we can find the distance she rows in 64 seconds:
Distance in 64 seconds = 1.25 * 64 = 80 feet

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can set up a proportion to find the total amount of water taken on:
Water taken on in 10 feet = 2 liters
Water taken on in 80 feet = 2 * (80 / 10) = 2 * 8 = 16 liters

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

There are 4 teachers, each with 2 lessons per day, so the total number of lessons per day is 4 * 2 = 8.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, so the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

"Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can write an equation:
Jamal's phone = 6 * Brittany's phone
1800 = 6B

Now, let's solve for B:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

It is given that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. So, we can write another equation:
B = 50D + D (since it's 50 times more, not 50 times as many)
300 = 51D

Now, let's solve for D:
D = 300 / 51
D = 5.88 (round down to the nearest whole number since you can't have a fraction of a duck)
D = 5.88 ≈ 6 (round to the nearest whole number)

Number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo: 6"

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
Original cost: $10 each
Number of boards: 10
Total original cost: 10 * $10 = $100
New price after 50% increase: $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15
Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
Original cost: $16 each
Number of boards: 5
Total original cost: 5 * $16 = $80
New price after 50% increase: $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24
Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $24 = $120

Total original cost: $100 + $80 = $180

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio and then find the value of one part.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 120. Since the ratio is in terms of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, we can set up the equation:

20x = 120

where x is the value of one part.

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 120 / 20
x = 6

Now that we know the value of one part, we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used by multiplying the number of parts of sugar (7) by the value of one part (6):

Number of teaspoonfuls of sugar = 7x
= 7(6)
= 42

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially was 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Now, we know that each container has 5 vehicles. To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we divide the number of vehicles imported on the second day by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = x + (0.3 * x)
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Since Lylah's salary also increased simultaneously, we need to calculate her new salary. However, the problem doesn't specify the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. Assuming her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), we can calculate her new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. 
Total hours for Tuesday and Wednesday = 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. 
Total hours for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday = 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 hours.

Total hours for the week = 8 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 28 (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her run into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two parts:

Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. 
One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20.

Now, we know that Jennie stamped 20 letters. Since there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters now, we subtract the 20 letters she stamped from the current total to find the original number of already-stamped letters.

30 (current total) - 20 (letters stamped) = 10

1 person with a unicycle had 1 tire inflated.

Total tires inflated = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.
Cost per tire = 25 cents = $0.25
Total amount made = 20 * $0.25 = $5

"To find the initial number of french fries, we need to work backwards.

First, we know that ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

Then, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon 'x'. We know that 1/3 of 'x' is 6 (since the raccoon stole 2/3, 1/3 remains). So, x/3 = 6, and x = 6 * 3 = 18.

Before the raccoon, there were 18 fries. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

Then, a seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14/2 = 7 fries. Before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

Finally, Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack. So, the initial number of french fries is 34 + 14 = 48.

"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, the total hours for these days are 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, the total hours for these days are 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

Length of rolls in feet: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet
Length of croissants in feet: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet
Length of baguettes in feet: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

First, we add the number of bananas needed per month: 
200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the total number of bananas needed per month by 2:
700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

"To find the total distance run by each person, we need to calculate the distance for each of their movements.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, each back-and-forth movement is 200 yards (100 yards in one direction and 100 yards back). So, Blake's total distance is 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these movements is 80 yards (40 yards in one direction and 40 yards back). So, Kelly's total distance for these movements is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly's total distance is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

The difference in their distances is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the depth of the water on Tuesday. Since the tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday than on Monday, we add 7 feet to the depth on Monday:
   Depth on Tuesday = Depth on Monday + 7 feet
   Depth on Tuesday = 17 feet + 7 feet
   Depth on Tuesday = 24 feet

2. Now, we need to find the depth of the water on Wednesday, which is two thirds of the depth on Tuesday. To do this, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3:
   Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * Depth on Tuesday
   Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 feet
   Depth on Wednesday = (2 * 24) / 3 feet
   Depth on Wednesday = 48 / 3 feet
   Depth on Wednesday = 16 feet

"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin separately and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

"To calculate the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the number of 2-month periods and then apply the compound interest formula.

36 months / 2 months = 18 periods

The interest rate per period is 20% of the original price, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.

The formula for compound interest is A = P * (1 + r)^n, where A is the final amount, P is the principal (initial) amount, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

However, in this case, the interest rate is a percentage of the original price, not the current price. So, we need to adjust the formula to A = P * (1 + r)^n, where r is the decimal equivalent of the percentage increase, which is 0.20 in this case, but as a percentage of the original price, it is 1.20 (1 + 0.20) times the original price every 2 months.

A = 20 * (1.20)^18 ≈ 20 * 55.9017

A ≈ 1118.034

The final answer is: $1118.03"

We know that one red car costs $4. 
We also know that an action figure costs $5.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the cost of the doll is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work, which is worth $35/hour. So, the total lost income is:
3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant, which is $90.

The difference between the lost income and the accountant's fee is:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. 

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation:
S = 2B

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2 and Seth's age will be S + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:
(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:
B + S + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:
B + S = 24

Now, substitute S = 2B from the first equation into the second equation:
B + 2B = 24

Combine like terms:
3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages:
Sally Two: 19 years old
Granny Red: 16 years old
Sally Four: 8 years old

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation involving profit, cost, and unit pricing. 

Let's denote the number of gallons of lemonade they made as 'x'. 

The cost of making 'x' gallons of lemonade is the cost of lemons plus the cost of sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. So, the total cost is 3x + 2x = 5x.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the total revenue from 'x' gallons is 0.50 * 20 * x = 10x.

The profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is given as $25. So, we can set up the equation:

10x - 5x = 25

Combine like terms:

5x = 25

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 5

Now that we know they made 5 gallons of lemonade, we can find the amount they spent on lemons. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of lemons is 3 * 5 = 15.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes.

Since the events are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25.

Now, we need to find the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage. The difference in probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

So, the neighbors took back 6 flamingos, painted them white, and put them back out on Sue's front yard. 

Now, the total number of flamingos on Sunday morning before adding more pink flamingos is 18 (original pink) - 6 (taken back) + 6 (painted white) = 18. 

Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. 

The total number of pink flamingos is now 18 (original pink) - 6 (taken back) + 18 (newly added) = 30. 

The total number of white flamingos is 6. 

The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months: 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher and then calculate his total earnings.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits x sentences for Publisher B.

We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

So Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

We know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, and Publisher B pays twice that amount, which is 10 cents per sentence.

Mark's earnings from Publisher A are 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

Mark's earnings from Publisher B are 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

Mark's total earnings are 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. 
2 slices/ sandwich * 7 sandwiches = 14 slices

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
3 slices/ omelet * 3 omelets = 9 slices

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese.

Now, we add up Brinley's scores on the first five tests.

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since we want to remove the lowest score (71), we subtract it from the total.

438 - 71 = 367

Now, we add the remaining four scores.

89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

We want a total of 465 for the five highest scores. Since we already have 367 from the four highest scores, we subtract 367 from 465 to find the score she needs on the sixth test.

Each time he rode 25 kilometers, so the total kilometers for the first 4 weeks is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

For the last 3 weeks:
Micheal rode 2 times a week, so in 3 weeks, he rode 2 * 3 = 6 times.
Each time he rode 60 kilometers, so the total kilometers for the last 3 weeks is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Weight of 25 chocolate bars = 25 * 40g = 1000g
Weight of 80 candied apples = 80 * 20g = 1600g

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of one cup as 'x'. Since we are given the cost of twenty dozen cups, we need to convert this to the cost of individual cups. There are 12 cups in a dozen, so twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

The cost of 240 cups is 240x.

We are also given that half a dozen plates cost $6000 each. Half a dozen is 6, so the cost of 6 plates is $6000. 

However, we are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. This means the cost of 6 plates is actually the cost of half a dozen plates, which is $6000. 

The cost of 240 cups is $1200 less than the cost of 6 plates, so we can set up the equation:

240x = 6000 - 1200

Simplifying the equation:

240x = 4800

Now, divide both sides by 240:

x = 4800 / 240
x = 20

"To find out how much money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes, we need to add the cost of the jacket and the cost of the shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 x $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits them 4 times. So, she earns 4 x $5 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's add the money Sara already had and the money she earned from babysitting: $10 + $20 = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes, and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40, we can divide $40 by $4: $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write an equation:

w = r + 2

We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, we can write another equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'w' from the first equation into the second equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we know the distance Gary needs to cover. To find the time, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

Now, we know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. After 4 minutes, the small pool will have x - 4*4 = x - 16 gallons, and the big pool will have 2x - 4*4 = 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it leaks at 4 gallons/minute, it now has:

24 - 16 = 8 gallons

Zack's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan. 

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candies James has and then compare it to the number of candies John has.

Let's start by using the information that John has twice as many candies as Robert. Since John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54

where x is the number of candies Robert has.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 27

So Robert has 27 candies.

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has:

27 + 6 = 33

candies.

Finally, we can compare the number of candies John has (54) to the number of candies James has (33). To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract:

54 - 33 = 21

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of books each person reads.

Dolly has 2 books of her own and reads Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly reads 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora has 1 book of her own and reads Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora reads 1 + 2 = 3 books.

In total, they collectively read 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

However, we counted each book twice (once for each person), so we need to divide the total by 2 to avoid double-counting.

The correct total number of books they collectively read is 3 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 4 books, or alternatively, 6 / 2 = 3 + 1 = 4 books.

"To find the number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert the time it takes to write those pages from minutes to hours.

First, Mike has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals left.

Since each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind, the total number of letters exchanged per week is 2 * 2 * 3 = 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages exchanged per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he writes 60 pages per week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page, so the total time he spends writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls. So, the total minutes used is:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his total plan:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

"To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know Griffin ended up with 27 fries. We also know Colby took 3 less than Kyle, who took 5. So Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Before Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 27 + 2 = 29 fries.

We know Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.

Before Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had 29 + 10 = 39 fries.

Before Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had 39 + 5 = 44 fries.

We know Griffin started with 24 fries. So, Ginger gave Griffin 44 - 24 = 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

We are given that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

2x = 28

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

However, this is the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we need to divide this by 2 to find the number of fish in each aquarium:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium, but the question asks for the number of fish in each aquarium, so the answer is 7.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate, we need to calculate the number of cookies she ate on both days. 

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate a total of 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed is 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

The total calories her sister consumed is 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories her sister consumed from the calories Sue consumed: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school and then the total number of girls in the first two classes. 

Since the school is 50% girls and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60. 
The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

The first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, so the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, we can find the number of girls in the third class by subtracting the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students and 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

We are also told that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now we know that Rick killed 12 cougars today, and 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the animals he killed last night and today:

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we first need to find the total number of cows in all 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, 10 stalls have 20 cows each, so the total number of cows in these 10 stalls is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Since Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls, each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, the 10 stalls that initially had 20 cows each will have 20 + 2 = 22 cows each, and the other 10 stalls will have 2 cows each.

We are asked to find the number of cows in 8 stalls. Since we don't know which stalls are chosen, we will assume the 8 stalls are from the 10 stalls that initially had 20 cows each.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since the tree is 200 feet tall and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height by 10 to find the number of sections: 
200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to find the total weight:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the tree, we need to find 30% of the total weight and subtract it from the total weight. 
30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as 'A' and the number of bananas Jamal has as 'B'. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, the number of apples Andrea has is A + 8. We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so A + 8 = 52.

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so B = A + 4.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is B/2.

Now, we can solve the equation A + 8 = 52 to find the number of apples Jamal has:
A + 8 = 52
A = 52 - 8
A = 44

Now that we know Jamal has 44 apples, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has:
B = A + 4
B = 44 + 4
B = 48

Now that we know Jamal has 48 bananas, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
B/2 = 48/2
B/2 = 24

Now we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas both Andrea and Jamal have:
Total number of fruits = (Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas) + (Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas)

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost is 13 * 15 = 195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads, we first need to find the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each is 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the remaining length by the length of each bead:

17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68

Number of sterling silver beads: 68"
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. The total number of stories in the first week is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120.

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 
Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

The total number of stories in the second week is 40 + 80 + 120 = 240.

"To find out how many cents Kelly has initially, we need to calculate the total value of her coins. 

5 quarters = 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents
2 dimes = 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents
Total cents = 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Kelly has 145 cents initially. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we subtract 55 cents from her total.

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

3 rows of 8 stars = 3 * 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars = 2 * 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, we subtract the total stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows.

76 (total stars) - 36 (stars in 8-star and 6-star rows) = 40 stars

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows.

40 stars / 5 stars per row = 8 rows

"To find the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

Total weight of flagstones = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight of flagstones = 80 * 75
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, divide the total weight of flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck:
Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and 3 trucks can only carry 3 * 2000 = 6000 pounds, which is exactly the weight of the flagstones, the answer is:

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour. 
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we need to multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars per packet. 
8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars.

Since 4 adults get 6 chocolate bars each, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is:
4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars.

Now, we subtract the chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars.

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children to find out how many each child will get:
16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars.

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she spends working. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she takes a 30-minute break. So, the total time she works is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2.5 hours is equal to 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so we need to divide the total minutes worked by 10 to find the number of 10-minute intervals. 
150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 per interval, her total earnings are 15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75.

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the points of each player after 3 rounds:
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

2. Determine the extra points for each player in the fourth round:
   - Mike has 21 points, which is more than 20, so Mike gets 1 extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so Jim gets 0 extra points.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so Tony gets 1 extra point.

3. Calculate the total points of each player after the extra points have been distributed:
   - Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
   - Jim has 18 + 0 = 18 points.
   - Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

4. Calculate the total points of all three players:

Total activities on the first day: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last:
21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks

42 kg / (0.2 kg * 2 * 5) = 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days = 21 / 7 = 3 weeks

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the pattern of page arrangement.

When a piece of paper is folded vertically and unfolded, it creates 4 pages: 2 on the front and 2 on the back. The pages are arranged in a specific order: the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the third page is on the right front, and the fourth page is on the right back.

Since each piece of paper creates 4 pages, we can divide the total number of pages (32) by 4 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 4 pages per piece of paper = 8

So, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 8.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Watson works 5 days a week, so in a month, he works 4 * 5 = 20 days.

Since Watson works 10 hours a day, in a month, he works 20 * 10 = 200 hours.

Watson earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings from his hourly wage in a month is 200 * $10 = $2000.

Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets 4 * $300 = $1200 bonus.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases * $50 each = 3 * 50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The cost of a business suit is $100. 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit is 5 * 100 = $500. 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit, so the flight ticket costs 500 + 700 = $1200.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month. The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to work backwards from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

We know that at the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the net change at the second stop is 8 - 7 = 1.

Now, let's subtract this net change from the total number of people heading to the third stop: 20 - 1 = 19.

This means that before the second stop, there were 19 people on the bus.

We also know that at the first stop, 5 more people got in. So, to find out how many people were on the bus before the first stop (i.e., the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal), we subtract 5 from 19: 19 - 5 = 14.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage points to be charged and then convert the time from minutes to hours.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, it will take 40 * 3 minutes to fully charge.

40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they earned and the total discount they received.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they get $1 off for every $20 spent, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. Each reward is worth $1, so they earned $4 in rewards.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 rewards, so the price is now $43 - $4 = $39.

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's use 'c' to represent the number of cows and 'h' to represent the number of chickens.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
c + h = 60

We also know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write the equation:
h = 2c

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for 'c':
c + 2c = 60
3c = 60
c = 20

Now that we know 'c', we can find 'h':
h = 2c
h = 2(20)
h = 40

Now, we know that cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. So, the total number of legs is:
Total legs = (4 * c) + (2 * h)
Total legs = (4 * 20) + (2 * 40)
Total legs = 80 + 80

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of pairs sold each day to find the total number of pairs sold:
14 + 28 + 8 = 50

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the amount spent on faulty equipment. 

The amount spent on faulty equipment is 40% of $400,000. 
40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on faulty equipment from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on functioning equipment.
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to find the number of apples picked on each day. 

On Monday, Lucy got $56 from selling the apples. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples picked on Monday can be found by dividing the total amount by the price per apple:
$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on each day:
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To find the monthly payment, we first need to calculate the total interest Karan has to pay. 

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given: 
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months = 5/12 years (since the interest rate is annual)

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * (5/12) 
Interest ≈ $152.08

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
Total amount ≈ $3,650 + $152.08 
Total amount ≈ $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, 
Monthly payment = Total amount / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $3,802.08 / 5 
Monthly payment ≈ $760.42

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 
Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver and gold pesos they have:
Total silver pesos = 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 + 120 = 200

Total number of pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find the profit per hour, we need to calculate the total profit and then divide it by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells all the lemonade, the total revenue is: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The total cost is $18.

The total profit is: $36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18.

Since Millie sells 4 cups per hour, the total number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade is: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

The profit per hour is: $18 (total profit) / 9 hours = $2.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"

165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now, we multiply the value of 1 part by the number of parts each person has:
Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 × 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 × 15 = 90 popsicles.

"To find the energy consumption in kilowatts, we first need to calculate the total watt-hours (Wh) saved in 30 days. 

Mel originally used the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, but he reduced the time by 5 hours. So, the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

The original energy consumption per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh.
The new energy consumption per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh.

The energy saved per day is 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh.

Since there are 30 days, the total energy saved is 4500 Wh * 30 = 135,000 Wh.

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000 (since 1 kWh = 1000 Wh).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount (30/2 = 15) from the shortest trees.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees (2 * 30 = 60) and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees (3 * 15 = 45).

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average).

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation:

(30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500

Combine like terms:

Subtract 145 from both sides:

x = 355

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 355.

"Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, and there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations. Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate 'd':
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
2c - c = 124
c = 124

Now that we have the value of 'c', we can substitute it into the first equation to find 'd':
c + d = 180

"To find the total distance traveled, we need to break down the information into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Since this distance is for 2 days, we don't need to divide it by 2.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the total distance traveled:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Total distance traveled: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up a proportion to find Zack's locker size.

Let's denote Zack's locker size as Z. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can write:

5 = (1/4)Z

To find Z, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can set up another proportion:

Z = (1/2)T

where T is Timothy's locker size. We can substitute Z = 20:

20 = (1/2)T

To find T, we can multiply both sides by 2:

T = 20 * 2
T = 40

Stanley's original elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between Oliver's elevation and the elevation of the comb to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many cats were carried away by the boats. Since 4 boats carried away 5 cats each, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

2. Now, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats on the rock: 50 - 20 = 30.

3. Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. Since 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse, we need to calculate 3/5 of 30. To do this, we multiply 30 by 3 and then divide by 5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the normal rate period, and the increased rate period.

1. Introductory period (6 months): 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. Normal rate period (8 months): 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. Increased rate period: Since Bill signed up for 2 years (24 months), and the introductory period and normal rate period together lasted for 14 months, the increased rate period will be 24 - 14 = 10 months. 
   Increased rate period (10 months): 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Let's assume the original price of the tattered jeans is x. Since Cole saved 2/3 of the total savings from the tattered jeans, the amount saved from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * $6 = $4. 

The price of the tattered jeans after the discount is $28, so the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, the amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * $6 = $2.

The price of the jogger jeans after the discount is $22, so the original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans before the discount. The original price of the jogger jeans is $24 and the original price of the tattered jeans is $32. 

The difference in the original prices is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Lillian built 3 bird feeders and bought 3 others. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, while the ones she made attract 10 more birds each, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

The total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.
The total number of birds attracted to the feeders Lillian made is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Now, we add the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 60 + 90 = 150.

The cost of the bagel is $4.
The cost of the soup is 25% more than the bagel. 
25% of $4 is 0.25 * $4 = $1.
So, the cost of the soup is $4 + $1 = $5.

The cost of the cake is half of the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake to find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's say Kenny started with x cards.

Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of the cards. The number of cards he sells is (2/3)x.

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is (2/3)x * $1.5 = $1x.

He uses this money to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left for spending cash. So, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $100 + $50 = $150.

We can set up the equation: $1x = $150

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by $1: x = 150 / 1
x = 100

However, this is the number of dollars, not the number of cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, we need to divide 100 by 1.5 to get the number of cards he sold, then multiply by 3/2 to get the total number of cards he started with.

Number of cards he sold = 100 / 1.5 = 66.67
Since you can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 66.67 * 3/2 = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hotdogs prepared and the total number of hotdogs needed.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them having two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so the caterer prepared 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who might want two, and 18 x 1 = 18 hotdogs for the other 18 guests. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, there is a shortage of 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest who didn't get a second hotdog would have been short one hotdog, the number of guests who didn't get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to find half of the letters in Indras' name and add 4. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 
Adding 4 to this gives 3 + 4 = 7.

So, Indras' sister's name has 7 letters. 
The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

To find the discount, we need to calculate 20% of the total cost before the discount.
The discount is 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

To find the final cost, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount.
The final cost is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

There were 15 gallons of gas divided into 5 containers, so each container had 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so she needed 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, 3/4 gallons is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips and then determine how much he spent on candy bars.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips.

Since George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of $5, which is 0.99 x 500 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on chips from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on candy bars: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find the number of candy bars: 375 / 75 = 5.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten by Rory and her mom from the total weight of the cake.

First, we need to find the weight of each piece. Since the cake is cut into 8 pieces, we divide the total weight by 8:
20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, they ate 2 pieces in total. The weight of the two pieces eaten is:
2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake:

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards). First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width:

360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula (Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)):

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, James' swim time is 90% of Jon's swim time.
James' swim time: 0.9 * 40 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon.
James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Let's denote James' run time as x minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time taken by James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
Total time for James: 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up an equation to find James' run time:
James' swim time + James' bike ride time + James' run time = Total time for James

"To find the total amount Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately, then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans per week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, in a week, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles per week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, in a week, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, we add the amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair of shoes has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the number of pairs by 2.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add the shoes he already had to the new shoes:
200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, so we subtract 180 from 300:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, the total number of cookies he gets is (x/2) + 2.

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we'll first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(x/2) = 5 - 2
(x/2) = 3

Now, we'll multiply both sides by 2 to isolate x:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is, we need to first convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. 

There are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long. So the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the combined length of the remoras is 12 / 12 = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is. 

Percentage = (combined length of remoras / shark's body length) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 0.1 * 100

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing and subtract that from the total number of kids in the class.

Let's use a Venn diagram approach:

- Number of kids allergic to dairy (D) = 9
- Number of kids allergic to peanuts (P) = 6
- Number of kids allergic to both (D ∩ P) = 3

To find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, then subtract the number of kids allergic to both (to avoid double-counting):

Total allergic to at least one thing = (D + P) - (D ∩ P)
= (9 + 6) - 3

20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300.
The price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.
For 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

We know that together they collected 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
L + D + B = 43

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write the equation:
L = D + 7

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write the equation:
D = B/2 or 2D = B

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
(D + 7) + D + B = 43
Combine like terms:
2D + B + 7 = 43
Subtract 7 from both sides:
2D + B = 36

Now we can substitute the third equation into the above equation:
2D + 2D = 36
Combine like terms:
4D = 36
Divide both sides by 4:
D = 9

Now that we know D, we can find B:

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost of her bus trips per day is:
2 trips/day * $2.20/trip = $4.40/day

Since she takes the bus 5 days a week, the total cost of her bus trips per week is:
$4.40/day * 5 days/week = $22.00/week

Now, let's subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

"To find the total number of animals, we need to determine the number of cows at the zoo and the number of sheep at the farm.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo:
- Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals: 40 + 80 = 120

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to first determine the total number of days he has to lose the weight. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 201 days (December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days, March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and 19 days in July).

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds and needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit needed is 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.

To calculate the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 201 days = approximately 522 calories per day.

"To find the total distance Hannah will run, we need to multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap. 

Distance per lap: 0.25 km
Number of laps: 8

Total distance = Distance per lap * Number of laps
Total distance = 0.25 km * 8
Total distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Total distance * Water needed per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

Now, subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate 25% of the remaining money (the amount spent on CDs):

"To solve this problem, let's use a system of linear equations. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can write the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Now, divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x:
3x = 3 * 30,000
= 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * Suzanne's cookies
Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister. 
Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
Remaining money = $160 - $80 = $80

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner.
3/5 of the remaining money = 3/5 * $80 = 3 * $16 = $48
Amount of money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

Rob's time in minutes = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Royce's time = 2 * Rob's time + 40
Royce's time = 2 * 120 + 40
Royce's time = 240 + 40
Royce's time = 280

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour. 
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she will use for the cookies. Since she is dividing the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will use 1/3 of the total raisins for the cookies.

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins for cookies = 27 * 1/3 = 9 cups

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins.

Number of batches = 9 / (3/4) 
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have, and then add the number of sofas they have.

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'c'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3c chairs.

We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas. So, the number of chairs Ophelia has is 20 + 2 = 22.

Now, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has: 3 * 22 = 66.

The total number of chairs is 22 + 66 = 88.

The total number of sofas is 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + (Jenna's sofas). Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

The total number of sofas is 20 + 64 = 84.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 88 + 84 = 172.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find the cost of the headphone set. 

Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as 'x'. Since Tom paid $48 in total and the CD cost $4, we can set up the equation:

4 + x = 48

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

So, the headphone set costs $44. 

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. We can divide $44 by the cost of one CD ($4):

44 / 4 = 11

Since Tom already bought one CD, we need to add that to the number of CDs he could have bought:

11 + 1 = 12

However, the question asks how many more CDs Tom could have bought, so we subtract the one CD he already bought from the total:

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

The new total number of passengers is:

In 8 years, Jame's age will be:
J + 8 = 22 + 8
J + 8 = 30

In 8 years, his cousin's age will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age:
C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5
C + 8 = 2(30) - 5
C + 8 = 55

Now, subtract 8 from both sides to find C:
C = 55 - 8
C = 47

C - J = 47 - 22
C - J = 25

The difference in their ages is 25 years.

So, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

We also know that the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. 

Let's denote the cost of one monitor as 'x'. Then, the total cost can be represented as:

Combine the constants on the left side:
$1,100 + $700 = $1,800

"To find out how many bottles Bill needs in total, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest. 
70 guests * 2 bottles per guest = 140 bottles

Bill already has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each. 
2 cases * 24 bottles per case = 48 bottles

"To find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water, we need to calculate twice the time it takes him to swim in cold water and add 2 minutes. 

Twice the time it takes Ray to swim in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 
Adding 2 minutes to this gives 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Since the question asks about hot and cold days, but the information given is about cold and warm days, we will assume that the time it takes Ray to swim in hot water is the same as in warm water.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm (or hot) water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total time she spent reading is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, her reading speed is 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 pages per minute.

In the first week, Judy read for 105 minutes, so the number of pages she read is 105 * 1.33 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read 100 pages.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna as R, M, and A, respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: R = M + 20
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: R = A + 45
3. Richie scored 80 goals: R = 80

We can substitute R = 80 into the first two equations:
80 = M + 20
80 = A + 45

Now, we can solve for M and A:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have the values for M and A, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide $70 by 7 to find the daily amount he can spend:
$70 ÷ 7 = $10 per day

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. Since he spent $10 per day for 4 days, he spent a total of:
$10 per day * 4 days = $40

The number of wooden action figures he bought is:
$40 ÷ $5 per action figure = 8 wooden action figures

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $70 - $40 = $30 left to spend. Since he wants to spend $10 per day for the remaining 3 days, he can spend the remaining $30. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:
$30 ÷ $2 per action figure = 15 plastic action figures

The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is the sum of wooden and plastic action figures:
8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Actual temperature = 468
Set temperature = 450
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will give an actual temperature of 520 degrees, with the same 4% error.

Let x be the set temperature. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

Actual temperature = x + (0.04x)

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
One of the implants has a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. 
So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work: 
$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the largest angle, which is 3x:

3x = 3(30) = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

8 quarters = 8 * $0.25 = $2.00
6 dimes = 6 * $0.10 = $0.60
14 nickels = 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
15 pennies = 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Total amount of money = $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

Number of gumballs = $3.45 / $0.05 = 69

Ruiz makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4.
Marissa makes (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, we find the amount of chocolates they make together in an hour. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour, and Marissa makes 90 pounds in an hour. 
Together, they make 60 + 90 = 150 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Now, let's divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per month:
10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months

We know that four apples cost $5.20, so we can write the equation:
4a = 5.20

We also know that three oranges cost $3.30, so we can write the equation:

Sales from green hats = $400 * 2
Sales from green hats = $800

Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales for the first month = $400 + $800
Total sales for the first month = $1200

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. 
3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time for nap = 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

Let's denote the cost of one candy as 'c'. Since Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20, we can set up the equation:

5 * 0.40 + 4c = 3.20

First, calculate the cost of 5 lollipops:
5 * 0.40 = 2.00

Now, rewrite the equation:
2.00 + 4c = 3.20

Subtract 2.00 from both sides:
4c = 1.20

Divide both sides by 4:
c = 0.30

Now that we know the cost of one candy ($0.30), we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 * 0.40 + 10 * 0.30 = 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00

"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to find out how many coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we need to find the total number of coins each of them saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.
Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find the total bill, we first need to find the cost of the vaccines. 
2 vaccines at $20 each is 2 * $20 = $40.

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the vaccines are 40% of the total bill. 
Let's call the total bill 'x'. 
40% of x is $40, so 0.4x = $40.
Divide both sides by 0.4 to find x: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

Now we know the total bill is $100. 
John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of all the fruits in the crate.

The price of one banana is twice the price of an apple, so it's 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The price of an orange is three times the price of a banana, so it's 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of all the fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so 14 + 4 = 18
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so 18 + 6 = 24
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so 24 - 12 = 12

Now, let's add the number of squares of each color together: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find the total number of chairs needed, we need to add the number of adults and babies. 
Total number of people = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people.

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is:
5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

The total number of chairs available is the sum of regular chairs and high chairs:
40 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 48 chairs.

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs available from the total number of people:
57 people - 48 chairs = 9 chairs.

"To find out how many points the class is missing, we need to calculate the total points collected by the students. 

First, we know Adam has 50 points. 
Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15. So Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, we add up the points collected by all the students: 
Adam: 50 points
Betty: 65 points
Tom: 35 points
Marta: 105 points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity + Gary's capacity = Total capacity
4,000 + 4,800 + Gary's capacity = 11,600

Combine the constants on the left side:
8,800 + Gary's capacity = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides to isolate Gary's capacity:
Gary's capacity = 11,600 - 8,800
Gary's capacity = 2,800

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to determine the number of dumplings each male ate and then calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings Larry cooked is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females: 32 + 18 = 50.

Speed of turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to find the amount they still need to raise. 

The amount they still need to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they raise per hour by dividing $2100 by 3. 
$2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we can find the number of hours they need to raise the remaining amount by dividing $4200 by $700.
$4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

Since they already fundraised for 3 hours, we need to add the 6 hours to reach their goal.

40% (water used by the city) * 80% (used for industrial purposes) = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:
40% (water used by the city) - 32% (used for industrial purposes) = 40% - 32% = 8%

For the adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 s'mores
Total s'mores needed: 18 s'mores + 6 s'mores = 24 s'mores

Since each sleeve makes 8 s'mores and there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to find out how many sleeves are needed and then convert that to boxes.

Total sleeves needed: 24 s'mores / 8 s'mores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Dora's age is given as 15 years. 
Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidate A and candidate B got.

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A got 20% of 100, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. 50% of 20 votes is 0.5 * 20 = 10 votes. So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C got by subtracting the votes of candidate A and candidate B from the total number of voters. 

Candidate C's votes = Total voters - (Candidate A's votes + Candidate B's votes)

Since there are 50 students in total, the number of students who like to play video games or play music is 50 - 15 = 35.

We also know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students who like to play video games or play music.

80 / 2 = 40 students per class

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls per class

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since a small sticker is worth one small button, but she is trading for large buttons, and a large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. Since a large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. 
She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading 50% of her large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the rest of her large stickers. Since the problem asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert large buttons to small buttons for a uniform count. 
9 large buttons are worth 9 * 3 = 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. 
So, the total number of buttons is 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which is 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies. 
The cost of these movies will be $5 per movie. 
The total cost of these movies will be 160 * $5 = $800.

The remaining movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies. 
The cost of these movies will be $10 per movie. 
The total cost of these movies will be 240 * $10 = $2400.

The total cost of replacing the movies is $334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534.

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to find the distance driven and the distance hiked.

Let's first find the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. The driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so half of that is 25 miles per hour. 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know the hiking speed and the time spent hiking, so we can find the distance hiked. Distance = speed * time. Distance hiked = 20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

We also know the total time spent driving and hiking, which is 6 hours. We know the time spent hiking, which is 1.5 hours. So, the time spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Now, we can find the distance driven. Distance = speed * time. Distance driven = 50 miles per hour * 4.5 hours = 225 miles.

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked. Total distance = 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

"To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as 'e' and the number of berries she collects as 'b'. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies, the number of enemies Ava jumps on is 'e + 8'. Ava collects 3 more berries, so the number of berries Ava collects is 'b + 3'. 

Let's denote the time left on the timer for Emma as 't'. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, the time left on the timer for Ava is 't - 4'.

Now, we can set up the equation for Emma's score: 
Emma's score = 10e + 5b + 30t

And the equation for Ava's score:
Ava's score = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)

Expanding Ava's score equation:
Ava's score = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
Ava's score = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25

Now, we can find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
Difference = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
Difference = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25 - 10e - 5b - 30t
Difference = -25

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas. 

First, we subtract 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 
64 - 30 = 34 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we need to divide the cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the number of times they ride on the other two days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days. 
So, the number of times they ride on the usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. 
So, the number of times they ride on each of these days is 2 * 3 = 6.
The number of times they ride on the other two days is 6 * 2 = 12.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'. We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we can write the equation:

w + o = 17

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Initially, he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After adding the new fish, he had (3 + o) orange fish and (4 + w) white fish. Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write the equation:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'o' into the first equation:

w + (5 + 2w) = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

Divide by 3:

w = 4

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance traveled, the total fuel consumption, and then multiply it by the fuel price.

The one-way distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles. Since he travels to and from work, the total distance per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

He works from Monday to Friday, so the total distance per week is 10 miles * 5 days = 50 miles.

Given his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total fuel consumption per week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon. Therefore, the total fuel cost per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

The amount spent from the quarters is 140 quarters. Since each quarter is $0.25, we multiply 140 by $0.25:
140 * $0.25 = $35

The amount spent from the twenties is 3/5 of 10 twenties. First, we find 3/5 of 10:
3/5 * 10 = (3 * 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6

Since each twenty is $20, we multiply 6 by $20:
6 * $20 = $120

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the combined fraction of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8. 

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8. 
So, we convert 1/4 to 2/8 (multiply numerator and denominator by 2). 

Now, we add 2/8 and 1/8, which is 3/8. 

This means 3/8 of the TVs are either smart or analog. 
To find the fraction of OLED TVs, we subtract 3/8 from 1 (the whole). 
1 can be written as 8/8. 

So, 8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8. 

This means 5/8 of the TVs are OLED TVs. 

Now, we multiply 5/8 by the total number of TVs (40) to find the number of OLED TVs. 
5/8 * 40 = (5 * 40) / 8

3/5 * 10 = (3 * 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6 groups

Now, we know that 6 groups had members bring back seashells. Since each group has 9 members and each member brought back 2 seashells, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of members per group and then by the number of seashells per member.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals she should have for 30% to be a whole number. 

Let's assume the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats is x. 

30% of x is the number of stuffed goats. We can express this as 0.3x.

The number of stuffed animals she already has is 14. After buying goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + number of goats.

We can set up the equation: 0.3x = number of goats
x = 14 + number of goats

Substituting the value of x in the first equation, we get:
0.3(14 + number of goats) = number of goats

Expanding the equation, we get:
4.2 + 0.3(number of goats) = number of goats

Subtracting 0.3(number of goats) from both sides, we get:
4.2 = 0.7(number of goats)

Dividing both sides by 0.7, we get:
number of goats = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many cars Joe has initially, we need to determine that he has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cars Joe gave away or sold: 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away or sold from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first find out the total amount raised by the students. 

The total amount raised is $175,000, and $50,000 comes from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we need to divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. 

$125,000 / 20 students = $6,250.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we need to convert the total time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour. 
So, the total time in minutes is (8 + 4) * 60 = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to calculate the total amount he earns per cycle and then multiply it by the number of cycles he does in a day.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20, so the amount he earns per cycle is:
5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6 per cycle

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are:
$6/cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, but we don't need Julie's score to find Sasha's total.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add Sasha's points in both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of cards Becca has as B, Smendrick has as S, and PJ has as P.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
B + S + P = 341

We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so we can write the equation:
B = S + 12

We know that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so we can write the equation:
S = 3P

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
(S + 12) + S + P = 341

Combine like terms:
2S + P + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S + P = 329

Now, we can substitute the third equation into this equation:
2(3P) + P = 329

Expand and combine like terms:
6P + P = 329
7P = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
P = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
S = 3P
S = 3(47)
S = 141

Now that we know Smendrick has 141 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:
B = S + 12
B = 141 + 12
B = 153

"To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
Weight-based cost: 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
Distance-based cost: 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
Refund amount: 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.00

Milly will lose the difference between the book's original price and the refund amount, minus the shipping cost:

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production in the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To calculate this, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to his savings.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it would take one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours, it would take one kangaroo 3 times as long, or 3 * 18 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that it would take a turtle twice as long to cross the highway as it would a kangaroo. So, it would take one turtle 2 * 54 = 108 hours to cross the highway.

Since there are four turtles, but they are all traveling at the same speed and the question asks for the time it would take them to cross the highway, the number of turtles is irrelevant to the answer. The time it would take four turtles to cross the highway is the same as the time it would take one turtle.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are used. 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used portion is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. 
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

Now, we need to find a common denominator for 6, 3, and 2. The least common multiple of 6, 3, and 2 is 6. 

So, we convert 1/3 and 1/2 to have a denominator of 6: 
1/3 = 2/6 
1/2 = 3/6

Now, we add the used portions: 
5/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 10/6 = 5/3

Since each glue stick is 12 millimeters long, we multiply the total used portion by 12: 
(5/3) * 12 = 20

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the total length of all the glue sticks minus the total length of the glue sticks that are used. 
Since there are 3 glue sticks, the total length of all the glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters.

"Let's denote the brother's age as B, the sister's age as S, and your age as Y. 

Since you are three years younger than your brother, we can write an equation:
Y = B - 3

Since you are 2 years older than your sister, we can write another equation:
Y = S + 2

We also know that your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age. Let's denote your mom's age as M:
M = 3B - 1

When you add all your ages, you get 87. So, the sum of your ages is:
Y + B + S + M = 87

Now, substitute the expressions for Y and M from the first and third equations into the last equation:
(B - 3) + B + (Y - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Since Y = S + 2, we can substitute S with Y - 2 in the equation above. Now, substitute Y with B - 3:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
5B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96

Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number, we'll round it to the nearest whole number. However, we'll check if the ages work out correctly with the given information.

If B = 19, then Y = 19 - 3 = 16, and S = 16 - 2 = 14. Now, M = 3 * 19 - 1 = 56.

The sum of their ages is 19 + 16 + 14 + 56 = 105, which is not equal to 87.

If B = 18, then Y = 18 - 3 = 15, and S = 15 - 2 = 13. Now, M = 3 * 18 - 1 = 53.

The sum of their ages is 18 + 15 + 13 + 53 = 99, which is not equal to 87.

If B = 20, then Y = 20 - 3 = 17, and S = 17 - 2 = 15. Now, M = 3 * 20 - 1 = 59.

The sum of their ages is 20 + 17 + 15 + 59 = 111, which is not equal to 87.

If B = 17, then Y = 17 - 3 = 14, and S = 14 - 2 = 12. Now, M = 3 * 17 - 1 = 50.

The sum of their ages is 17 + 14 + 12 + 50 = 93, which is not equal to 87.

If B = 16, then Y = 16 - 3 = 13, and S = 13 - 2 = 11. Now, M = 3 * 16 - 1 = 47.

"To find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student will get. 

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack. 

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

6.75 packs → 7 packs

"To find the total amount of water passing through the river, we need to calculate the amount after the first increase and then add the additional increase on the third day.

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, we add 6000 to the amount on the second day: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Total amount of water passing through the river: 14000"
"To model this situation, we can use the formula for exponential growth with discrete time steps:

N(t) = N0 * r^t

where:
- N(t) is the number of infected people at time t
- N0 is the initial number of infected people (10 in this case)
- r is the growth rate (7 in this case, since each infected person infects 6 others, making 7 people in total, including the original infected person)
- t is the time step (in days)

We want to find the number of infected people after 3 days, so we'll plug in t = 3:

N(3) = 10 * 7^3
N(3) = 10 * 343
N(3) = 3430

"To find out how much money Rafaela received, we need to multiply the number of customers by the tip amount. 
40 customers * $20 per customer = $800

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. 
10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80
So Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720

To find the total amount of money they received, we need to add the tips received by Rafaela and Julieta.
$800 + $720 = $1520

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 6 badges (12 months / 2 months per badge).

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's compare the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year. The difference is 36 (Wendy's badges) - 6 (Amber's badges) = 30 badges.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to find the number of silver coins first. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can subtract 30 from the number of gold coins to find the number of silver coins.

Number of gold coins = 70
Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins.

Total number of coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total number of coins = 70 + 40
Total number of coins = 110

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the number of red, green, and blue cars. We can find the total number of these cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations with three variables. Let's denote the number of books each person has as follows:

- Sofie: S
- Anne: A
- Fawn: F

We are given the following information:
1. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can use substitution to solve the system. From equation (2), we can express S in terms of A. From equation (3), we can express A in terms of F.

Substituting equation (3) into equation (2), we get:
S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

Now, substitute S and A in terms of F into equation (1):
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85
Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84
Divide by 3:
F = 28

Fawn has 28 books."

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces were left after the first two days. 
60 - 24 = 36 pieces left after the first day.
36 - 10 = 26 pieces left after the second day.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, we can multiply the cost of 1 bottle of soda by 3 to get the cost of 3 bottles of soda.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

To find the cost of 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of 1 bottle of water. Since 4 bottles cost $8.00, we can divide $8.00 by 4 to get the cost of 1 bottle of water.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x. 
Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times.
In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since the problem doesn't specify the amount paid by Kamala and Alba, let's denote the amount paid by Kamala as K and the amount paid by Alba as A.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts paid by Joe, Kamala, and Alba. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Joe's lawn x times, the amount paid by Kamala is 3 times the amount paid by Joe, which is 3 * 6 = 18. Similarly, the amount paid by Alba is 5 times the amount paid by Joe, which is 5 * 6 = 30.

However, the problem states that the amount paid by Kamala and Alba is for the number of times Tasha mowed their lawns, not the total amount they paid. So, the amount paid by Kamala is 3x * K and the amount paid by Alba is 5x * A.

But we already know that the amount paid by Kamala is 3 times the amount paid by Joe, which is 18, and the amount paid by Alba is 5 times the amount paid by Joe, which is 30. Since Joe paid $6 for x times, the amount paid by Kamala is 3x * K = 18 and the amount paid by Alba is 5x * A = 30.

Since we know that Joe paid $6 for x times, we can set up the equation 6 = x * 6, which simplifies to x = 1.

Now we can find the amount paid by Kamala and Alba. The amount paid by Kamala is 3x * K = 3 * 1 * K = 3K = 18, so K = 6. The amount paid by Alba is 5x * A = 5 * 1 * A = 5A = 30, so A = 6.

Now we know that the amount paid by Joe is $6, the amount paid by Kamala is $18, and the amount paid by Alba is $30. The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 5 more than Daniel's 13 pages today. So Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. 
Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today. 
Daniel's total pages = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel.
Difference = Denise's total pages - Daniel's total pages = 28 - 13 = 15

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after dinner.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating dinner, that's 2 adults and 2 children. 

2 adults will eat 2 bowls of soup. 
2 children will eat 2 bowls of soup.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls are equivalent to 3 adult bowls (2 adult bowls + 1 adult bowl equivalent to 2 child bowls), 1 adult bowl of soup will be left.

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the leftover soup can fill 2 child bowls.

Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup 1 time."

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for small masks and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
To make 20 small masks, she will need (20/4) * 2 yards of material = 10 yards of material.

For large masks: 
Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, she will need (8/3) * 2.25 yards of material = 6 yards of material.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on activities = 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking) = 19 hours.

Now, let's subtract the total hours spent on activities from the total hours in a day to find the free time:
24 (total hours) - 19 (hours spent on activities) = 5

"To find the number of blue shoe boxes left, we need to subtract the number of blue shoe boxes used from the total number of blue shoe boxes. 
7 (total blue shoe boxes) - 3 (blue shoe boxes used) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

To find the number of red shoe boxes used, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes. 
1/3 * 9 (total red shoe boxes) = 3 red shoe boxes used.

Now, we subtract the number of red shoe boxes used from the total number of red shoe boxes. 
9 (total red shoe boxes) - 3 (red shoe boxes used) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

To find the total number of shoe boxes left, we add the number of blue shoe boxes left and the number of red shoe boxes left. 
4 (blue shoe boxes left) + 6 (red shoe boxes left) = 10 shoe boxes left.

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so D = 60.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was D - 8, and Adam's age four years ago was A - 4. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can write the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides of the equation, we get:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

A = 30

So Adam's current age is 30. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = A + 8
= 30 + 8
= 38

"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Since Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, we can calculate it as follows:

Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm: 2 * 200 = 400 acres
Farmer Smith's farm: 400 + 100 = 500 acres

Now, we can find the total number of acres by adding the sizes of both farms:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500
Total acres = 700

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's use 'r' to represent the number of red balloons and 'y' to represent the number of yellow balloons.

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon, and he threw a total of 58 pieces. This can be represented by the equation:

2r + 3y = 58

We also know that there were 20 red balloons, so we can write the equation:

r = 20

Now, we can substitute the value of 'r' into the first equation:

2(20) + 3y = 58

Expanding the equation, we get:

40 + 3y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

y = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a month and then divide that by the number of miles his car can go before needing a tune-up.

Total miles driven in a month = miles driven per day * number of days in the month
Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, divide the total miles driven by the number of miles his car can go before needing a tune-up:
Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / miles per tune-up
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles
Number of tune-ups = 3

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and will stop at 10 years old. So, she has been collecting shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 
5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the number of months:

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we subtract 15 from the total number of cups.

Total cups = 27
Cinnamon tea cups = 15
Remaining cups for chamomile and mint tea = 27 - 15 = 12

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we divide the remaining cups by 2 (for chamomile and mint) and then by 3 (for the number of rows).

Cups of chamomile and mint tea = 12
Equal cups of chamomile and mint tea = 12 / 2 = 6
Cups of mint tea in each row = 6 / 3 = 2

"To find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to first determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate it as follows:

Initial amount of water in the pool = 10000 gallons
Initial amount of water in the tank = 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

Now, we need to find the amount of water emptied from the tank in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so:

Amount of water emptied in 6 days = 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Finally, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount:

Amount of water remaining in the tank = Initial amount of water in the tank - Amount of water emptied

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has spent so far and subtract that from the total amount his parents gave him.

Colby saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, which cost $10 each, so he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those movies. He saw 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each, so he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those movies. He had 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost $8 each, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn. He had 4 boxes of candy, which cost $2 each, so he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy.

Total money spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

Colby's parents gave him $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket will cost $10. He also wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost $8 + $2 = $10. So, the total cost for the night will be $10 + $10 = $20.

"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the calories in a mini cinnamon roll. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we multiply the calories of a normal cinnamon roll by 1/3:
600 * 1/3 = 600 / 3 = 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll.

Now, let's find the calories in a mini blueberry muffin:
450 * 1/3 = 450 / 3 = 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin.

Now, we multiply the number of mini cinnamon rolls by their calories and the number of mini blueberry muffins by their calories:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

"To solve this problem, let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and Jean's (also referred to as John's) age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. P + L + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old)
2. L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute the second equation into the first and third equations to simplify the system.

Substituting L = J + 10 into the first equation:
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Substituting L = J + 10 into the third equation:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now we have two equations:
1. P + 2J + 10 = 100
2. P = 2J + 10

Substituting P = 2J + 10 into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + 2J + 10 = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find L and P:
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 50

The age of Peter is 50."

They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the total number of tables needed.

"To find the amount of hay each sheep needs, we need to calculate twice the amount each goat needs and subtract 3 pounds. 
Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than that, so 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. 
15 goats * 5 pounds per goat = 15 * 5 = 75 pounds for the goats.
12 sheep * 7 pounds per sheep = 12 * 7 = 84 pounds for the sheep.

Labor cost: 2.25 hours, but since it's $35 per hour or part thereof, we round up to 3 hours. Labor cost = 3 * $35 = $105
Parts cost: $60

Total cost = Visit charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total cost = $40 + $105 + $60
Total cost = $205

"To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs, the amount he saved with the discount, the amount he got from selling the CDs, and then find the difference.

The total cost of the CDs without discount is 10 * $15 = $150.
The discount is 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.
So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He sold 5 CDs for $40, but we need to find out how much he paid for those 5 CDs. Since he paid $90 for 10 CDs, the cost per CD is $90 / 10 = $9. So, he paid $9 * 5 = $45 for the 5 CDs he sold.

Now, let's calculate how much money James was out: 
He paid $90 for the CDs and got $40 from selling 5 of them. The CDs he sold cost him $45, so he lost $45 - $40 = $5 on those CDs. 
He still has 5 CDs that cost him $45 (5 * $9). 
So, in total, James was out $5 (loss on sold CDs) + $45 (cost of remaining CDs) - $40 (amount received from selling CDs) = $10.

"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of root crop and then add them together.

The cost of 6 yams at $1.5 each is 6 * $1.5 = $9.
The cost of 10 sweet potatoes at $2 each is 10 * $2 = $20.
The cost of 4 carrots at $1.25 each is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's add the total cost of each type of root crop together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

"To find the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, we need to find the distance James swam initially. Since he swam 60% of the 20-mile lake, we can calculate the distance as follows:
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

Now, we can find the initial swimming time:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

Next, we need to find the resting time. Since James rested for half as long as the swimming time, we can calculate the resting time as follows:
Resting Time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Now, we need to find the remaining distance James needs to swim:
Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Distance Swum
Remaining Distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

Since James swims at half the speed for the remaining distance, his new rate is:
New Rate = 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour

Now, we can find the final swimming time:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

Finally, we can find the total time it took James to get across the lake:
Total Time = Initial Swimming Time + Resting Time + Final Swimming Time
Total Time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 
Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. 
So, the bakery has 490 - 40 loaves of bread.

"Let's denote Marcus' age as M, Leo's age as L, and Deanna's age as D. We are given the following information:

1. Marcus is half of Leo's age: M = 0.5L
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: M = D - 5
3. Deanna is 26 years old: D = 26

We can substitute D = 26 into the second equation to find Marcus' age:
M = 26 - 5
M = 21

Now, we can substitute M = 21 into the first equation to find Leo's age:
21 = 0.5L
L = 21 / 0.5
L = 42

Leo's age is 42."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D respectively. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that B + A + D = 45.

We can rewrite the first two equations as A = B - 20 and D = B - 10. 

Substituting these into the third equation, we get B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3B - 30 = 45.

Add 30 to both sides: 3B = 75.

Divide by 3: B = 25.

Now that we know B, we can find A: A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5.

Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to first find the total number of pages per inch, considering that each paper is printed on both sides. Since there are 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, the actual number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches to find the total number of pages. 

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time Vince spent stapling and then multiply it by his rate.

First, let's convert the time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM to minutes. 
8:00 AM to 12:00 PM is 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours, which is 11 * 60 = 660 minutes.
Total time spent stapling is 240 + 660 = 900 minutes.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, his rate is 30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports per minute.

Now, multiply the total time spent stapling by his rate:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports.

"To find the total minutes Kim slept, we first need to find the total time she was supposed to sleep and then subtract the time she was awake.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. that day. 

The total time she was supposed to sleep is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 + 55 = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was awake. She was awake from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes, and she was also awake for the 5 minutes before waking up. So, the total time she was awake is 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

Now, subtracting the time she was awake from the total time she was supposed to sleep, we get 475 - 28 = 447 minutes.

= 2 * 8
= 16

So, Jonathan initially has 24 measuring cups and 16 measuring spoons, for a total of 40 utensils.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has:
24 measuring cups (no change)
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining = 24 + 10

"To find the number of unoccupied beds, we first need to find the number of occupied beds initially and then the number of beds occupied after 2 weeks.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 
1/5 of 1000 is 1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds occupied initially.

The number of unoccupied beds initially is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks, the number of days is 14. 
So, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 200 + 700 = 900.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 1000 - 900 = 100.

2. Two-thirds of the remainder (9 emails) are to family. To find two-thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2/3. 
   9 * (2/3) = 18/3 = 6 emails to family.

3. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after removing the work emails and the emails to family. 
   9 - 6 = 3 emails.

4. One-third of the remaining emails (3 emails) are to her boyfriend. To find one-third of 3, we multiply 3 by 1/3.

Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, we know Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. We multiply Shawna's age by 5 to find Shawna's father's age.

The total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.

Since the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, the number of Pokémon caught by Stan is 4x - 13.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon caught by Alex is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. So, we can write the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon caught by Stan:

Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches/foot.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we need to find the total space each plant will occupy, including the space between plants. Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between each plant. 

12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space) = 30 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant occupies.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants (because the last plant would not have enough space). However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we subtract those from the total.

44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants

Each plant costs $6, so we multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost per plant.

27 plants * $6/plant = $162

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the total soil used from the total amount of soil they have:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, in a year she will have 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost of each pair of shoes.
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté the shrimp, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:

Time to peel = Total shrimp / Rate of peeling
Time to peel = 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute
Time to peel = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the rate at which she sautés the shrimp, we divide the number of shrimp by the time:

Rate of sautéing = Number of shrimp / Time
Rate of sautéing = 30 shrimp / 10 minutes
Rate of sautéing = 3 shrimp/minute

Now, we can find the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp:

Time to sauté = Total shrimp / Rate of sautéing
Time to sauté = 90 shrimp / 3 shrimp/minute
Time to sauté = 30 minutes

Finally, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to sauté the shrimp to find the total time:

Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté
Total time = 15 minutes + 30 minutes
Total time = 45 minutes

"To find the final temperature change, we need to calculate the temperature change for each period and add them together.

1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at 2 degrees per hour. 
   Temperature change = 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees

2. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at 3 degrees per hour.
   Temperature change = 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees

3. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour.
   Temperature change = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees (this is a warming, so it's positive, but since we're calculating the net cooling, we'll consider it negative) = -4 degrees

Now, let's add the temperature changes together:
6 degrees + 12 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. 

Let's set up an equation to represent this relationship:

2x = 44

where x is the number of trips the first plane makes.

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 44 / 2
x = 22 * 2
x = 88 / 2
x = 44

However, the correct equation should be x = 44 * 2, since 44 is half the number of trips the first plane makes.

x = 44 * 2
x = 88

So, the first plane makes 88 trips in a day. 

Now, we know that three-quarters of the flights are to Greece, and the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. 

The number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * 88 = 66.

The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that the total age of the children is 20. We know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, so we can subtract their ages from the total to find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred.

Let's denote the age of Helene as H and the age of Wilfred as W. We know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, so the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7.

The total age of the children is 20, so the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Since there are 4 children, the average age is the total age divided by 4, which is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, her age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now we know that Helene's age is 10, and the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13. We can set up an equation to find Wilfred's age:

H + W = 13
10 + W = 13

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

W = 3

1500 cookies * 1/2 = 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies.

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:
750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets and then convert it to a percentage.

Let's assume the total number of slices is 6 (2 adults and 4 kids). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can represent the size of the slices as follows:

Adults: 2x, 2x
Kids: x, x, x, x

The total size of the slices is 2x + 2x + x + x + x + x = 8x

Each adult gets 2x out of 8x, so the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets is 2x/8x = 1/4.

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/4) * 100 = 25%

"To find the time spent on rounds, we multiply the time per inpatient (20 minutes) by the number of inpatients (9). 
9 * 20 minutes = 180 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

To find the time spent on appointments, we multiply the time per appointment (30 minutes) by the number of appointments (10).
10 * 30 minutes = 300 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60.
300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, we add the time spent at the clinic (9 hours), the time spent on rounds (3 hours), and the time spent on appointments (5 hours) to get the total time spent.
However, the time spent at the clinic is the total time available, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the time spent at the clinic.
9 hours - 3 hours - 5 hours = 1 hour

- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours (120 minutes) to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Divide both sides by 8:
x = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to know the total cost and the revenue. However, the question does not provide the revenue per session. Assuming the revenue per session per student is not provided, we can only calculate the cost.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is:

$25 (rent) + $1.50 (cost per student) * 10 (number of students) = 
$25 + $15 = $40 per session

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total cost per week is:
$40 per session * 3 sessions per week = $120 per week

In a month (assuming 4 weeks), the total cost is:
$120 per week * 4 weeks per month = $480 per month

However, without the revenue per session, we cannot calculate the expected earnings."
"To find out how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each of them has by the number of boxes they have.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as 'x' and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as 'y'.

We know that Peter has 4 boxes with 'x' chocolate bars in each, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is 4x. We are given that Peter has 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

4x = 64

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Similarly, we know that Martha has 7 boxes with 'y' chocolate bars in each, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is 7y. We are given that Martha has 56 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

7y = 56

To find 'y', we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

y = 56 / 7
y = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:

Difference = x - y

Now, we know the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is:
Yellow sticks = Blue sticks - 3
Yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Yellow sticks = 11

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

"To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards.

Let's start with the final charge of 28%. Before that, the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours. To find the charge before this period, we can set up an equation:

Charge before 7% loss = 28% / (1 - 0.07)^3
Charge before 7% loss = 28% / (0.93)^3
Charge before 7% loss = 28% / 0.794
Charge before 7% loss = 35.26%

Before this, the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours. To find the charge before this period, we can set up an equation:

Charge before 9% loss = 35.26% / (1 - 0.09)^5
Charge before 9% loss = 35.26% / (0.91)^5
Charge before 9% loss = 35.26% / 0.624

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as 's' and the price of a large stuffed animal as '3s'. We know that 's' is $4. 

The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals sold as 'x' and the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'y'. We know that x = 2y.

The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is 4x and the total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is 12y. The total earnings is $120.

We can write the equation as 4x + 12y = 120.

Substituting x = 2y into the equation, we get 4(2y) + 12y = 120.

This simplifies to 8y + 12y = 120.

Combine like terms: 20y = 120.

Divide both sides by 20: y = 6.

Since x = 2y, x = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To find the amount of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe: 
   Since one dwarf can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, 
   12 pounds/day * 2 = 24 pounds/day.

2. Calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe: 
   Since one dwarf can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, 
   24 pounds/day * 1.5 = 36 pounds/day.

3. Calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine in a month with a steel pickaxe: 
   36 pounds/day * 30 days = 1080 pounds.

4. Calculate the amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with steel pickaxes:

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the unit rate (price per sandwich) of the given packages and then apply it to the package with 8 sandwiches.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the unit rate is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.5 per sandwich.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the unit rate is $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.5 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the unit rate is the same for all packages, which is $1.5 per sandwich.

Now, we can find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the unit rate by the number of sandwiches:
Price = unit rate * number of sandwiches
Price = $1.5 * 8
Price = $12

Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate step by step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.
So, the remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15.

The green balloons remain unchanged at 7.

Then, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.
So, the remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6.

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.
75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

Now, let's add up all the remaining balloons: 
15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 34.

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 1.

1. The probability of having a substitute teacher is 50% or 0.5. In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.

2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.

3. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06.

Now, let's add the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 
0.5 (substitute teacher) + 0.2 (normal teacher with extension) + 0.06 (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 0.76

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 1 - 0.76 = 0.24 or 24%.

"To calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income, we need to calculate both.

The total amount of loans Jim took is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

The amount of income Jim lost while in school is the income he would have earned if he had worked instead of going to college. Since he had a $25,000 per year job before college, the total lost income is:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

The total amount Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

To calculate the time it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

"To find the area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to the length and width of the bed.

Length of fabric = Length of bed + 2 feet
Length of fabric = 6 feet + 2 feet
Length of fabric = 8 feet

Width of fabric = Width of bed + 2 feet
Width of fabric = 8 feet + 2 feet
Width of fabric = 10 feet

Now, we find the area of one piece of fabric by multiplying the length and width.

Area of one piece of fabric = Length of fabric * Width of fabric
Area of one piece of fabric = 8 feet * 10 feet
Area of one piece of fabric = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.

Total area of fabric = 2 * Area of one piece of fabric
Total area of fabric = 2 * 80 square feet
Total area of fabric = 160 square feet

So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost. 
Total lost = $5 (lost) - $11 (won) + $16.50 (lost) = $10.50.

Since he had a win, the total amount lost is actually the difference between the total lost and the total won.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first person, the share of the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the share of the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so the sum of the shares of the three people is equal to 1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine the x terms and constants:

"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of balls retrieved in each set. 

Let x be the number of balls retrieved in the second set. 
The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4 (since it's 4 more than the second set).
The number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2 (since it's half of the second set).

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation:
(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:
2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
First set = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the number of emails James responds to in a day, we first need to find 20% of 80, which is the number of emails that don't require a response.

20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails a day. To find the number of emails he responds to in a day, we subtract 16 from 80.

80 - 16 = 64

Now, we multiply the number of emails James responds to in a day by 5 to find the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week.

64 * 5 = 320

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

"To find John's average score, we need to add up all his scores and divide by the number of tests.

John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total score for those tests is 100 * 3 = 300. 
He scored 80 on his 4th test, so the total score for all 4 tests is 300 + 80 = 380.

There are 4 tests in total. 

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 pizzas is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten.
So, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten.
So, the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

The total number of pizzas left is 6 (glee club) + 8 (football team) = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, let's add the costs together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars.

"To find the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to follow these steps:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches initially.
2. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the initial 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.
3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.
4. The number of meatballs left after Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.
5. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 + 3 = 6.
6. The total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find out how many trucks were able to deliver the fertiliser. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we need to find a quarter of 20 trucks. 
A quarter of 20 is 20 * (1/4) = 20 * 0.25 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser. 
The number of trucks that were able to deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

"To calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, we need to consider that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will get one half off. 

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide 6 by 2 to get 3 sets of 2 pounds. 

For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis will pay full price for one pound ($4.00) and half price for the other pound ($2.00). The total cost for each set of 2 pounds is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since Dennis needs 3 sets of 2 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $6.00 = $18.00.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * 60 = 20

The total amount they spent is $15 + $20 = $35.

The total amount they initially had is $60 + $60 = $120.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first find out the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day. Since the bananas are enough to feed the monkeys for a week, we divide the total bananas by 7.

Total bananas = 315
Total bananas per day = 315 / 7 = 45

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day = 10 + 14 = 24

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten per day.

Bananas eaten by the third monkey per day = Total bananas per day - Total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day
= 45 - 24

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and subtract it from the amount she paid with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and Jenny bought 15 roses, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- 12 roses cost $15
- 3 additional roses cost 3 * $2 = $6
- Total cost = $15 + $6 = $21

Jenny paid with 5 * $5 = $25.

Now, let's calculate the change:
$25 (amount paid) - $21 (total cost) = $4 (change)

Since the change is given in quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, we can calculate the number of quarters as follows:

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives in 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves in 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, the fourth train arrives in 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks needed.
200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.
80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll calculate the discount amount and then find the percentage:
Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by friend
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount amount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, we can calculate:
15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, we can subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total:

"To find the total number of minutes John spends learning in a week, we need to calculate the minutes spent in class and the extra learning time.

There are 6 periods in a day for a normal student, but John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To find the extra learning time, we need to calculate 1/16 of his weekly minutes. Since he spends 1600 minutes per week in class, his extra learning time is 1600 * (1/16) = 100 minutes per day on Saturday and Sunday. So, his total extra learning time is 100 * 2 = 200 minutes per week.

Now, we add the class time and extra learning time to get the total minutes spent learning per week: 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.

First, we know the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the 540 kilograms is half of what was left. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 1080 kilograms is half of the original weight. Therefore, the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

"To calculate how many more years Lauren needs to work, we'll need to determine her desired retirement income and then calculate how much she needs to save for retirement.

Lauren's desired retirement income is 40% of her current annual salary of $100,000:
$100,000 * 0.4 = $40,000 per year

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we'll multiply her desired retirement income by the number of years:
$40,000 * 20 = $800,000

Next, we'll calculate how much Lauren is currently saving per year. Assuming a 20% savings rate and a $100,000 salary:
$100,000 * 0.2 = $20,000 per year

Now, we'll divide the total amount Lauren needs to save ($800,000) by her annual savings ($20,000) to determine how many years she needs to work to reach her goal:
$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years

However, this calculation assumes Lauren starts from scratch. Since the problem asks how many more years Lauren needs to work, we'll assume she has already been working and saving for some time. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide information on how much Lauren has already saved. 

Assuming she hasn't saved anything yet, she would need to work 40 years. However, if she has already saved some amount, the number of years would be lower.

Assuming she hasn't saved anything yet, the answer would be:

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the total number of parts it will be cut into.

First, we divide the ribbon into 4 equal parts: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part.

Then, we divide each of these parts into 5 equal parts: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the whole based on the percentage given for the boys. Since 40% represents the boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of total students = 240 boys

We can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:
0.4 * total students = 240

Now, we can solve for the total number of students:
total students = 240 / 0.4
total students = 600

Since the total number of students is 600 and 240 are boys, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total:
number of girls = total students - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we first need to calculate her current daily mileage and the required daily mileage.

Soledad's current daily mileage is 125 miles * 2 times per day = 250 miles per day.

Since Soledad has 30 days in June to complete her 9,300 miles, we can calculate her required daily mileage as follows:
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Now, we can find out how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day by subtracting her current daily mileage from the required daily mileage:
310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day.

"To find out how many kilograms James will have left, we first need to determine how many kilograms Pierre, Paul, and Jacques will have left after Peter and Paul take their shares. However, the question does not mention Pierre, Paul, and Jacques taking any apples, it mentions Peter and Paul taking apples. Since James is mentioned instead of Jacques taking apples, we will assume Jacques is James.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The total amount taken by Peter and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, James will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so the rate of blinking is 255/5.

We can set up the proportion as follows:

255/5 = 459/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

255x = 459 * 5

255x = 2295

Now, we can divide both sides by 255:

x = 2295 / 255

x = 9

"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial number of fishes and the number of fishes Tate bought.

Initial male fishes: 4 (male guppies) + 3 (male goldfishes) = 7
Initial female fishes: 7 (female guppies) + 5 (female goldfishes) = 12

Tate bought: 2 (male guppies) + 2 (male goldfishes) = 4 male fishes
Tate bought: 1 (female guppy) + 3 (female goldfishes) = 4 female fishes

Total male fishes: 7 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 11
Total female fishes: 12 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes:

"To find the rate of the fifth worker, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker and the remaining time needed to produce the last 20 toys must have produced 400 - 200 - 20 = 180 toys.

However, the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the 20 toys were produced by the fifth worker in the remaining time after the 10-hour shift of the other workers. The fifth worker must have worked for some additional time to produce the last 20 toys.

Since the fifth worker produced 180 toys in 10 hours and 20 toys in some additional time, the 20 toys were produced in the additional time after the 10-hour shift. The fifth worker must have produced 180 toys in 10 hours.

The rate of the fifth worker is 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Vince's current age be x.

Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Two years ago, Vince's age was x - 2.

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. We can set up an equation:

14 = 2(x - 2)

Simplifying the equation:

14 = 2x - 4

Adding 4 to both sides:

18 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

9 = x

However, this is Vince's age two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2:

x = 9 + 2
x = 11

So, Vince is 11 years old now.

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:

2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four people is 56. We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. So, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is:

56 - 30 = 26

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted half of 26:

26 / 2 = 13

So Arnold painted 13 eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted:

21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Next, let's find the weight of the boxes. Since Nik has 200 crayons and he wants to separate them into groups of 8, we need to divide 200 by 8 to find the number of boxes. 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, let's add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together. 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we need to divide 400 by 16. 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk and then add it to the time she spends walking on the beach.

Let's denote the rate at which Grandma walks on the beach as 'r' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her rate on the sidewalk is '2r' miles per minute.

We know that distance = rate * time. On the beach, the distance is 2 miles and the time is 40 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

2 = r * (40/60)  (converting 40 minutes to hours)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2 = r * (2/3)
r = 3 miles per hour

Now, we can find the time it takes for Grandma to walk on the sidewalk. The distance is 1 mile and the rate is 2r = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour. 

Time = distance / rate
Time = 1 / 6 hours
Time = 10 minutes

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

"To find the number of sunflowers Faraday sold, we first need to find the number of sunflowers and bouquets he sold per day.

Let's denote the number of sunflowers as 's' and the number of bouquets as 'b'. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

We are given that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. We also know the cost of each sunflower ($2) and each bouquet ($8).

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

2s + 8b = 26 + 56 (total earnings per day)
12b = number of sunflowers in bouquets

However, we can simplify the first equation by combining the earnings from sunflowers and bouquets:
2s + 8b = 82

We can also rewrite the second equation as:
s + 12b = s + number of sunflowers in bouquets

Since we want to find the total number of sunflowers, we can rewrite the second equation as:
s + 12b = total sunflowers

Now, we can solve the first equation for 's':
2s = 82 - 8b
s = (82 - 8b) / 2
s = 41 - 4b

Now, we can substitute 's' into the second equation:
(41 - 4b) + 12b = total sunflowers
41 + 8b = total sunflowers

Now, we can use the fact that the total earnings from bouquets is $56 to find 'b':
8b = 56
b = 7

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers per day:
41 + 8(7) = 41 + 56
41 + 56 = 97

However, this is the total number of sunflowers per day. We need to find the total number of sunflowers after 3 days:

Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide his total money by the cost of each rock:
100 / 5 = 20 rocks

He buys 20 rocks and sells them for $7 each, but only sells 60% of his inventory. To find out how many rocks he sells, we multiply the total number of rocks by 60% (or 0.6):
20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Now, we calculate his total revenue by multiplying the number of rocks sold by the selling price:
12 * 7 = $84

His total cost is the amount he spent on buying the rocks:
20 * 5 = $100

To find out how much money he loses, we subtract his total revenue from his total cost:
100 - 84 = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, since Lauren can work on only one type of scene per day, we can't simply add the days together. Instead, we should find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days or find a combination that allows her to work on all scenes in the least amount of time.

A more efficient approach is to calculate the total work in terms of a common unit. Let's calculate the total work in terms of ""scene-days"" for each type of scene:
- Large scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

However, we can also express the work in terms of ""scene-days"" for each type of scene:
- Large scenes: 45 scenes * (1 day / 5 scenes) = 9 scene-days
- Medium scenes: 36 scenes * (1 day / 6 scenes) = 6 scene-days
- Small scenes: 49 scenes * (1 day / 7 scenes) = 7 scene-days

Now, let's find the total scene-days: 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 scene-days

However, this is not the correct way to calculate the total days. We should find the combination of days that allows her to work on all scenes in the least amount of time.

Let's try a different approach. We can calculate the number of days for each type of scene separately and then find the combination that allows her to work on all scenes in the least amount of time.

One way to do this is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of scenes for each type and divide the total number of scenes by the GCD.

However, a more straightforward approach is to try different combinations of days.

One possible combination is:
- 9 days for large scenes
- 6 days for medium scenes (can be done in the first 6 days of the 9 days for large scenes)
- 7 days for small scenes (can be done after the 6 days for medium scenes, and 1 day of the 9 days for large scenes, and 2 more days)

However, this is still not the most efficient way. A more efficient way is to do the scenes in the following order:
- 6 days for medium scenes and large scenes (6 * 5 = 30 large scenes, and 6 * 6 = 36 medium scenes)
- 3 days for large scenes (3 * 5 = 15 large scenes, 45 - 30 = 15 large scenes remaining)
- 7 days for small scenes (can be done after the 6 days for medium and large scenes, and 1 day of the 3 days for large scenes, but we can do the small scenes in the first 7 days, and the last 2 days for large scenes)

However, this is still not the most efficient way. A more efficient way is to do the scenes in the following order:
- 7 days for small scenes and large scenes (7 * 5 = 35 large scenes, and 7 * 7 = 49 small scenes)
- 2 days for large scenes (2 * 5 = 10 large scenes, 45 - 35 = 10 large scenes remaining)
- 6 days for medium scenes (can be done in the first 6 days, and 1 day of the 7 days for small and large scenes, but we can do the medium scenes in the last 6 days)

However, this is still not the most efficient way. A more efficient way is to do the scenes in the following order:
- 7 days for small scenes (7 * 7 = 49 small scenes)
- 6 days for medium scenes (6 * 6 = 36 medium scenes)
- 2 days for large scenes and 1 day for large scenes (2 * 5 = 10 large scenes, and 1 * 5 = 5 large scenes, and 45 - 30 = 15 large scenes remaining, 15 - 10 = 5 large scenes remaining)

However, this is still not the most efficient way. A more efficient way is to do the scenes in the following order:
- 7 days for small scenes (7 * 7 = 49 small scenes)
- 6 days for medium scenes (6 * 6 = 36 medium scenes)

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we multiply the probabilities together to find the probability that both tickets are winners:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person collected. 

Let's start with what we know: 
- Jim collected 27 seashells.
- Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
- Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, we know the number of seashells each person collected: 
- Jim: 27
- Carlos: 22
- Carrey: 11

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. To find the total number of seashells, we add the seashells collected by each person: 
27 + 22 + 11 = 60

Now, we divide the total number of seashells by the number of people (3) to find out how many each person got: 
60 / 3 = 20

The total cost is 6 devices * $20/device = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

"To determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed for one person. Since one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need to divide 100% by 20% to get the number of bottles needed for one person.

100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person

Now, we multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by the number of people (2300) to get the total number of bottles needed.

5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, we subtract this from the total number of bottles needed to find out how many more bottles they need to produce.

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and blue. Since there are 8 babies in total, 3/4 of them wear purple, which is (3/4) * 8 = 6 babies. The remaining 1/4 wear blue, which is (1/4) * 8 = 2 babies.

Now, let's find the number of babies wearing bows. All 2 blue-wearers wear bows, and 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows, which is (1/3) * 6 = 2 babies. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. To find the probability, divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows: (2 / 4) = 1/2 or 0.5.

"To find the total number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 60% of the combined total of the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the combined total is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
Since the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 5: 50 fruits

- Year 7: 7 times the initial amount = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 8: Let's denote the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree as x. Then, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 20 times the initial amount = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Since we know the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree is 1000, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree:
x - 200 = 1000 - 200 (since x is the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree)
x - 200 = 800
x is already known to be 1000.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years:
Year 1-4: 0 fruits (not given, but implied as the problem starts with a 5-year-old tree)

We are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation:
R + B + Y = 37

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

We can also substitute the second equation into the above equation:
5B + (B + 7) = 37
Combine like terms:
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:
B = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the yellow rope:
Y = B + 7
Y = 5 + 7
Y = 12

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call this amount x.

Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so the amount she gave away is 1/5 of her money. We can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

x = $3

So, Rissa gave away $3, and Ronnie also gave away $3.

Ronnie was originally given $5, so the amount left in Ronnie's money is:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the colors other than yellow. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.

Half of the total paint is yellow, so the other half is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Since red, white, and purple are equal, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of each color.

6 / 3 = 2

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and add the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.
Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to find the sum of the geometric sequence. 

The first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is 2. The number of terms (n) is 5.

The sum of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula: 
S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

The total number of clouds Alice counted is 93."
"To find the number of pods in the special size box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 
20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we need to find out how many pods you can get for $1. 
To do this, we divide the total number of pods by the cost of the box: 120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the steps in the problem.

First, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he has is 1000 / 20 = 50.

He loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. He has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

Since each bill is $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400 left.

Thomas then triples his money, so he now has 400 * 3 = $1200.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is $5, the number of 5 dollar bills he has is 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch of chalk per day.

However, since the teacher only has 2.75 inches of chalk left, we need to calculate how many days this will last. 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, we round down to 2 days.

The teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk, but we also need to consider the day he used 45% of the chalk. So, the total number of days is 2 + 1 = 3 days.

There are 12 boys, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the number of books he can buy per dollar by dividing 100 by 500. 
100 / 500 = 0.2 books per dollar.

Now, we can multiply the number of books per dollar by the total amount of money Bob has to find the total number of books he can buy.
0.2 * 27000 = 5400 books.

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find the number of books per school.
5400 / 3 = 1800.

2. After throwing the apple, 5 more apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up and put all but 1 in his pocket, leaving 1 apple to throw at the tree. At this point, he has 1 (initial apple) + 4 (from the 5 that fell) = 5 apples in his pocket.
3. After throwing the apple, 6 more apples fell from the tree. Newton picked them up and added them to the apples he already had in his pocket.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples Newton brought home:
Apples in his pocket: 5 (from previous steps)

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags of coal he ordered and then multiply that by the cost per unit.

First, we divide the total amount of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to find the number of bags:
850 kg / 50 kg = 17

Since Ali can't order a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, in this case, the division results in a whole number, so no rounding is needed.

Now, we multiply the number of bags (17) by the cost per unit ($18):

Since there are 12 slices per cheese pizza, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

Kate's 6 friends each eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so they will eat 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni pizza slices. 
Since there are 8 slices per pepperoni pizza, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour.

Jay's net rate of building snowballs per hour is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, we divide the number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

"To find the initial number of bandages, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. 

So, at the end of the third day, they had the bandages left from the previous days, plus the 100 bandages they ordered, minus the 25 they used. This can be represented as: 
bandages_left = (bandages_left_previous_days) + 100 - 25
78 = (bandages_left_previous_days) + 75

Now, we can find the bandages left at the end of the second day:
bandages_left_previous_days = 78 - 75
bandages_left_previous_days = 3

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

So, at the end of the second day, they had the bandages left from the first day, plus the 50 bandages they ordered, minus the 28 they used on the second day, and the 38 they used on the first day. This can be represented as:
bandages_left_previous_days = (initial_bandages) + 50 - 28 - 38
3 = (initial_bandages) + 50 - 66

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of each school separately and then add them together.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. 

John's classes have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. 
1/8 of 120 is (1/8) * 120 = 15 students per class.
Since John has 2 classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15 = 30 students.

Now, we add the capacity of both schools together:

"To find the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total amount he owes, including the interest, and subtract the amount he has already paid.

The interest is 2% of the principal amount of $300. 
Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The total amount Stephen owes is the principal amount plus the interest.
Total amount = $300 + $6 = $306

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months.
Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

The amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he owes minus the amount he has already paid.
Amount paid in the twelfth month = $306 - $275 = $31

"To find the volume of the jar, we multiply the base area by the height. 
Volume = base area * height 
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, we multiply the volume by 0.8 to get the actual volume occupied by the jelly beans.
Actual volume = 540 * 0.8 
Actual volume = 432 cubic inches

Now, we divide the actual volume by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans.
Total jelly beans = Actual volume / volume of a jelly bean 
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15 
Total jelly beans = 2880

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the estimated number of red jelly beans.
Estimated red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3 
Estimated red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.3 
Estimated red jelly beans = 864

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number.
Difference = True number - Estimated number 
Difference = 900 - 864 
Difference = 36

   Total number of people after the first stop = 20 + 40 = 60

2. Calculate the number of people who entered at the second station:
   Number of people who entered at the second station = 3/4 * 40 = 30

3. Calculate the total number of people after the second station:
   Total number of people after the second station = 60 + 30 = 90

4. Calculate the number of people after the third station:
   Since the number of passengers doubled at the third station, 
   Total number of people after the third station = 2 * 90 = 180

"To find the total amount Pauline spent, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost per visit is $2. Since Pauline visits 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost per visit increases by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of $2, which is 1.5 * $2 = $3. Then, we add this to the original cost: $2 + $3 = $5. The new annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

"To solve this problem, let's use a linear equation. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and after the cut, it will be divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x = 4 * 8 = 32.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can set up a proportion to find the number of pounds of meat needed.

Let x be the number of pounds of meat needed. We can set up the proportion as follows:

16 meatballs / 1 pound = 80 meatballs / x pounds

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

16x = 80
x = 80 / 16
x = 5

So, Aiden will need 5 pounds of ground beef. Since he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed:

2 tablespoons/pound * 5 pounds = 10 tablespoons

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the amount of water needed for each group of plants and then add them together.

4 plants need half a cup of water each, so the total amount of water needed for these plants is 4 * 1/2 = 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so the total amount of water needed for these plants is 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 + 8 = 12 plants have already been accounted for, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 12 = 8.

The total amount of water needed for these plants is 8 * 1/4 = 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add the total amount of water needed for each group of plants: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to cover the distance on land and in water separately, then add them together.

The total distance is 200 yards, with half on land and half in water. So, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards, and the distance in water is also 100 yards.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

The main phone costs $20. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, each additional phone costs half the cost of the main phone. 

Cost of each additional phone = $20 / 2 = $10

There are 4 additional phones (since there are 5 phones in total, and 1 is the main phone). 

Cost of additional phones = 4 * $10 = $40

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones to find the total cost of the phone plan.

Total cost = $20 (main phone) + $40 (additional phones) = $60

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells and multiply it by the price per doughnut.

1. First, we need to find the total number of doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 10 dozen doughnuts is equal to 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts.

2. Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts at $2 per doughnut, the total amount of money he makes in a day is 120 * $2 = $240.

3. To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to multiply the daily amount by the number of days in June. June has 30 days, so the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is $240 * 30 = $7200.

His new speed is 2.5 times his original speed of 150 WPM. 
New speed = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM.

Since there are 450 words per page, 10 pages would have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM.
Time = Total words / Speed

On the first day, there were 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, we have the number of people for the first three days: 50, 70, and 140.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. To find the total number of people for these 4 days, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240 people.

"To find the total number of kernels popped, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval and add them together.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, we add the number of kernels popped in each interval: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32

Combine the constants on the left side:

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance traveled west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Since Elvis turned around and traveled in the opposite direction, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the distance from his house:
Distance from house = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
= 144 miles - 90 miles

Total cookies after snack = 8 + 3 + 4 = 15 cookies

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)

Total cookies after lunch = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 cookies

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 (no change)
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Total cookies after giving to friends = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Total cookies after baking = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for each half of his collection and then add them together.

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. Half of 12 is 6. 

For the first half (6 toy soldiers), he would get $5 per toy. 
6 * 5 = 30

For the other half (6 toy soldiers), he would get $7 per toy. 
6 * 7 = 42

Now, we add the amounts for both halves together: 
30 + 42 = 72

"To find the total number of holes the dog digs, we multiply the number of holes the dog digs per day by the number of days Nate is on vacation. 

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

When Nate gets home, the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day, and Nate fills in 9 holes per day. The net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled per day.

To find the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net change in holes per day.

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks.

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Norman High School: 4000
Average enrollment at Butler High School: 4000 * (3/4) = 4000 * 0.75 = 3000

Now, we need to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School.

Difference: 4000 - 3000 = 1000

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Total non-chocolate chip cookies = Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies
Total non-chocolate chip cookies = 2595 + 3075
Total non-chocolate chip cookies = 5670

Now, subtract the total non-chocolate chip cookies from the total cookies:
Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Total non-chocolate chip cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations. Let's define the variables:

- T = number of test tubes Igor gathered
- B = number of beakers Igor gathered
- P = number of Petri dishes Igor gathered

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. However, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16/2 = 8.

We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.

Since Igor gathered the correct number of beakers initially but lost some, the number of beakers he gathered initially is 7. However, we don't know how many he lost, so we'll call the number of beakers he gathered B.

We know that the total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29. So, we can set up the equation:

T + B + P = 29

Substituting the values we know:

8 + B + 16 = 29

Combine like terms:

B + 24 = 29

Subtract 24 from both sides:

B = 5

Since Igor initially gathered 7 beakers but only 5 were on the lab bench, he lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will need, we first need to find out the total number of legs for the tables. Since each table has 4 legs and there are 4 tables, the total number of legs is 4 * 4 = 16.

Since each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws needed is 16 * 2 = 32.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to find the number of eggs in the second basket and add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each person and then add them together.

Alexandra raises $430.
Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raises $300.

Now, let's add the amounts raised by each person:
$430 + $750 = $1180
$1180 + $700 = $1880
$1880 + $300 = $2180

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa runs half as fast as Aaron. If Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran half the distance Vanessa did, then he ran 2 miles. 

We know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. To find the time it took Aaron to run 1 mile, we divide 16 minutes by 2 miles: 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile.

Since Vanessa runs half as fast as Aaron, it takes her twice as long to run 1 mile. So, it takes Vanessa 8 * 2 = 16 minutes to run 1 mile.

To find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we multiply the time it took her to run 1 mile by 4: 16 minutes * 4 = 64 minutes.

"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we need to multiply the length of the dock by 3, since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

Length of dock: 200 feet
Line needed per foot of dock: 3 feet
Total line needed: 200 * 3 = 600 feet

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract that from the total amount of line needed.

Total line needed: 600 feet
Line already available: 6 feet
Line to be bought: 600 - 6 = 594 feet

"To find the total amount Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total cost per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10.
They also order a $5 bottle of wine, so the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total amount they make per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total amount they make a week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to calculate the total cost of the watermelons and then the total selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80.

Since the vendor made a 25% profit, the selling price will be 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit).

Total selling price = 1.25 * Total cost
Total selling price = 1.25 * $80
Total selling price = $100

Now, to find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

"To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine his current age. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had James when he was 19 years old, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel:
60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
20 oranges (Ana) - 15 oranges (Jane) = 5 oranges

"To find the cost of the radiator, we need to calculate 80% off the original price. 
80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320. 
The discount is $320, so the price Mark paid for the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The cost of the mechanic's labor is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the cost of the radiator plus the cost of the mechanic's labor: $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's use 'c' to represent the number of chickens and 'w' to represent the number of cows.

We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:
c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. So, we can write the equation:
2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' in both equations the same:
2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':
(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to:
2w = 30

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'w':
w = 15

Now that we know 'w', we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for 'c'. We'll use the first equation:
c + 15 = 20

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:
c = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.
