"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to first find out how many eggs she sells. 

She starts with 16 eggs per day. 
She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. 
She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left. 

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 
So, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to find out how many bolts of white fiber are needed and add it to the bolts of blue fiber.

Since it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need to divide 2 by 2 to find the number of bolts of white fiber.

2 / 2 = 1

So, it takes 1 bolt of white fiber. Now, we add this to the 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house is $80,000, and the cost of repairs is $50,000. So, the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 100% (original value) + 150% (increase) = 250% of the original value.

The original value of the house is $80,000. To find 250% of the original value, we multiply $80,000 by 2.5 (since 250% = 2.5). 

$80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs 3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so we multiply 9 sprints by 60 meters per sprint: 9 x 60 = 540 meters.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to first find out the total amount of feed they need in a day. 

Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals in a day, each chicken needs 3 * 3 = 9 cups of feed per day.

Since there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 9 * 20 = 180 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given so far from the total amount of feed needed per day: 180 - 40 = 140 cups.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses: 
- The first pair (1st and 2nd glass) costs $5 + $3 = $8.
- The second pair (3rd and 4th glass) costs $5 + $3 = $8.
- The third pair (5th and 6th glass) costs $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fourth pair (7th and 8th glass) costs $5 + $3 = $8.
- The fifth pair (9th and 10th glass) costs $5 + $3 = $8.
- The sixth pair (11th and 12th glass) costs $5 + $3 = $8.
- The seventh pair (13th and 14th glass) costs $5 + $3 = $8.
- The eighth pair (15th and 16th glass) costs $5 + $3 = $8.

There are 8 pairs of glasses, each pair costs $8. 
So, the total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

"To find the total number of sheep, we need to find out how many sheep each city has. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she has to download the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download 200 GB is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it took to download 80 GB, the time for the restart, and the time to download the entire file: 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he didn't move because of the traffic, so the distance is 0.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drove at 30 mph. The distance is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drove at 80 mph. The distance is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 1.5
Distance = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled in the 4 hours is:
Total Distance = 0 + 15 + 120
Total Distance = 135 miles

However, we also need to consider the distance he traveled before turning around, which is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135
Distance from home = 45 miles

"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay separately.

Her regular pay is for 40 hours at $10 per hour, so:
40 hours * $10 per hour = $400

She worked 5 hours overtime (45 hours - 40 hours). Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so:
$10 per hour * 1.2 = $12 per hour
5 hours * $12 per hour = $60

Now, we add her regular pay and overtime pay to find her total earnings:
$400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the total cost and the total earnings.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the yearly cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). 

The total earnings will be the number of lemons the tree grows per year (7 lemons) multiplied by the price of each lemon ($1.5).

Let's calculate the total earnings per year: 
7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year

Now, let's calculate the net earnings per year (total earnings - yearly cost):
$10.5/year - $3/year = $7.5/year

Since Carlos spent $90 initially, we need to find out how many years it will take for him to earn back the initial cost. 
To do this, we divide the initial cost by the net earnings per year:
$90 / $7.5/year = 12 years

However, this is the time it takes to break even. To start earning money, it will take one more year. 

So, the number of years it will take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree is 13 years."
"Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3.

She sold 2 more to the red house.

Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

Now, she has (x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's multiply both sides by 2:

2(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 = 10

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3x - x - 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

So Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the increase in value for each option.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase rate = 2.5% = 0.025
Increase in value = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
New value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Initial value = $8,000
Increase rate = 1.2% = 0.012
Increase in value = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
New value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the profit from the jewelry ($125) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry.

Profit: $125"

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching.

As a teacher, she earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, she earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to know how many days are in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire eats 3 eggs every day, she eats 3 x 28 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 84 by 12.

84 / 12 = 7

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we need to first find the remaining distance. The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. 

So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find the total time she should take to walk the entire 12 miles, we divide the total distance by the desired average speed: 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

She has already taken 1 + 1 = 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles. So, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to multiply 10 liters by 2/3. 
10 * 2/3 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to subtract 1/3 liter of water from the orange drink (since 1 liter is 1/10 of 10 liters, and 1/10 * 2/3 = 1/15, but for simplicity, we can also calculate 1/3 from 2/3 * 1 = 2/3, and 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3, and 1/3 of 10 liters is 3.33 liters, and 3.33 * 2/3 = 2.22, and 2.22 - 1/3 = 2.22 - 0.67 = 1.55, but 1/3 is more accurate for this problem). 
6.67 - 1/3 = 6.67 - 0.33 = 6.34 liters of water in the remaining orange drink.

To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to multiply 15 liters by 3/5. 
15 * 3/5 = 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

Now, we add the amount of water in the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink. 
6.34 + 9 = 15.34 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find out how old Raymond is now and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 now, we can find Raymond's age by adding 6 to Samantha's age. 
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age.
Years ago = Raymond's current age - 23
Years ago = 37 - 23

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. We can write this as an equation: 
0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
x = 19.50 / 0.75

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell and Allen's current ages:
Darrell's age: 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

The first guess is 80. 
The second guess is 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40. 20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60.
The third guess is 25% more than 80. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. 20 more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to find out how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 x $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 x $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should be equal to the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Since he made $195 and spent $165, he must have made $195 - $165 = $30 from the lego sets he didn't sell.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

"To find out how many miles Dana can travel, we need to find her running and walking speeds. 

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 
3 miles/hour * 2 = 6 miles/hour

Now we know Dana can run at 6 miles per hour. Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.
6 miles/hour / 4 = 1.5 miles/hour

Now we know Dana can walk at 1.5 miles per hour. 

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she has 6 hours, we can find the time she spends running and walking by multiplying 6 hours by one-third and two-thirds respectively.
6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours
6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours

Now we know Dana spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking. We can find the distance she travels by multiplying the time she spends running and walking by her running and walking speeds respectively.
Distance running = 2 hours * 6 miles/hour = 12 miles
Distance walking = 4 hours * 1.5 miles/hour = 6 miles

Now we know Dana travels 12 miles running and 6 miles walking. We can find the total distance she travels by adding the distance she travels running and walking.
Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Original distance = 400 feet
Distance with gemstone = 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, we need to subtract that from the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone to find out how far outside the reach of the flames she can stand.

Distance outside the reach of flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To find out how many grams you can eat, we need to find out how many calories you have left for the day and then how many servings of chips you can have, and finally how many grams that is.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Each serving of chips has 250 calories. 
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since you can have 0.8 servings, and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, 
0.8 servings / 5 servings * 300g = 48g.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

Since Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). 

The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

The revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the revenue minus the cost: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to find out how many articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the number of hours it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 
Twice of 7 is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

Candice started with 80 post-it notes. She used 220 post-it notes at work. If she had 23 post-it notes remaining, then the total number of post-it notes she had must be 80 (initial) + x (purchased) = 220 (used) + 23 (remaining).

We can set up an equation: 
80 + x = 220 + 23
80 + x = 243
x = 243 - 80
x = 163

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to first find out how many blue ties he bought and then how many red ties he bought.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find out how many blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:
Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find out how much John spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:
Amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find out the total amount John spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
Total amount spent on ties = Amount spent on blue ties + Amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

Now, we multiply the number of dozens of eggs by the price per dozen to get the amount of money Lloyd makes per day.
21 * 2 = $42 per day.

The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday has the higher revenue. 
To find the difference, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

Annual salary after three more years of service: $798.60 * 12 = $9583.20"
"Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know that they sold 88,000 copies combined, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to find out how many guests will actually show up. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, we need to find 1/4 of 16.

1/4 of 16 is 16 / 4 = 4

So, 4 guests won't show up. That means 16 - 4 = 12 guests will show up.

Since Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest, we multiply 12 by .75.

12 * .75 = 9

So, Christina will need 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply 9 by 2.

9 * 2 = 18

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to calculate how much the adults and children will eat.

Adults will eat 10 lbs each, and there are 20 adults. So, the total amount of potato salad the adults will eat is 20 x 10 = 200 lbs.

Children will eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad the children will eat is 5 x 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the amount of potato salad the adults and children will eat to find the total amount Ted needs to bring: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find the total number of pets, we need to find out how many pets each person has. 

Cindy has 4 pets. 
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we add the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 
4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28

"To find Jackson's age, we need to figure out the ages of the other kids first. 

We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

We know Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles, we first need to find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and he used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find out how much time Gerald saved, we need to find 10% of 40 seconds. 10% of 40 seconds is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"To find the total number of pets, we need to find the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats. 

We know there are 60 dogs. Since there are two cats for every dog, we multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats. 
Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. We add them together to find the combined number of dogs and cats.
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. 
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats to find the total number of pets.
Total number of pets = 168 + 60 + 120 = 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we need to first find the number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, 3/5 of the students are girls. 
3/5 of 200 students = (3/5) * 200 = 120 girls.

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
2/3 of 120 girls = (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls.

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.
120 - 80 = 40

Harry slept 9 hours. 
James slept 2/3 * 9 hours = 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours.

9 hours (Harry) - 6 hours (James) = 3 hours.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to figure out how many cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of tomatoes (because 64 / 2 = 32).

Now, we know that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans Freda used, we divide the total ounces of tomatoes (64) by the ounces per can (16). 

64 / 16 = 4

So, Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes.

4 * 3 = 12

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = 30

She received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. So, now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. Since she has 40 window ledges, she will give away 40 potted plants.

So the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks 1 glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so that's 1 more glass of water. So, on weekends, he drinks 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water.

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are:
Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now, we can find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions:
Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night, so 2 hours total.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes), so 1.5 hours.
- Friday: 2 hours.

Total hours from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours in all, the hours left for Wednesday would be 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday would be 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards. 

Henry now has 110 cookies, but he dropped 5 cookies. So before he dropped the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

He actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he meant to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

He wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. So if we let x be the number of cookies he baked last year, then 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 100 / 2 = 50.

Beatrice's roll-ups were 2 wide and 24 long, so she ate 2 x 24 = 48 roll-ups.

Marcell's roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long, so he ate 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups.

The total number of roll-ups eaten is 48 + 42 = 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups eaten by 2 (the number of people).

Average = 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many feet Julia rowed to reach the shore. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We also know the shore was 64 seconds away. 

First, let's find out how many feet she rows per second. 
20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Now, let's find out how many feet she rowed in 64 seconds.
1.25 feet per second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

We know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. 
So, let's find out how many 10-foot sections are there in 80 feet.
80 feet / 10 feet = 8 sections.

Now, let's find out how much water the boat took on.
8 sections * 2 liters per section = 16 liters.

"To find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photograph, we need to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. 

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. 

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

To find out how many birds (ducks) are in Jamal's photograph, we can divide the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by 50.

300 / 50 = 6

"To find the profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the cost price and the selling price of the lumber.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 each, and she has 10 of them, so the total cost price is 10 x $10 = $100.

The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 each, and she has 5 of them, so the total cost price is 5 x $16 = $80.

The total cost price of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price. 

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $10 x 1.5 = $15 each. She has 10 of them, so the total selling price is 10 x $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the selling price is $16 x 1.5 = $24 each. She has 5 of them, so the total selling price is 5 x $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit Sasha makes is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to find out how many parts of the ratio she used in total. The ratio is 7:13, which means there are 7 + 13 = 20 parts in total.

We know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many parts she used, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts in the ratio (20).

120 / 20 = 6

This means that Katy used 6 times the ratio. To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar she used, we can multiply the number of parts of sugar in the ratio (7) by 6.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find out how many vehicles were imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

Number of containers imported on the second day: 4"
"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's call Lylah's salary four years ago 'x'. Then, Adrien's salary four years ago can be expressed as:
$40,000 = x + (30% of x)
$40,000 = x + 0.3x
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769. Since her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume her salary also increased by 40% (although the problem doesn't explicitly state this, it's a reasonable assumption given the context). 
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077

Now, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 
So, Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples than Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
Kael brought half the number of oranges than Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.
So, Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Now, we add the number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought to find the total number of fruits.
Total number of fruits = 13 (Morisette) + 14 (Kael) = 27

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. 
Total hours for Tuesday and Wednesday = 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. 
Total hours for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday = 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Now, let's add the hours for the entire week: 
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
Thursday to Sunday: 28 hours
Total hours = 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she runs 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles she ran in the first 3 hours and the miles she ran in the remaining 4 hours: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table. We also know that her husband bought 5 spoons. So, if we subtract the 5 spoons her husband bought from the total, we get the number of spoons Julia had before her husband bought the spoons. 

12 (total spoons) - 5 (husband's spoons) = 7

Now, we know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, if we add those 3 spoons back to the 7 spoons, we get the number of spoons Julia had before she used any. 

7 + 3 = 10

So, Julia had 10 spoons before she used any, and that's the number of spoons in the package she bought.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, that's 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

Total hours per week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type and add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguette to inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 2 feet is 2 * 12 = 24 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Finally, let's convert the total length to feet: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed per month and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Total bananas needed per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we multiply the total bananas needed per month by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

"To find out who ran the most, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards one way and 100 yards back). So, Blake ran 15 x 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these trips is 80 yards (40 yards one way and 40 yards back). So, Kelly ran 200 + (34 x 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards, Blake ran the most. To find out how much farther Blake ran, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80.

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 
So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After another 2 months (4 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4 = $28.

After another 2 months (6 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 6 months is $28 + $4 = $32.

After another 2 months (8 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 8 months is $32 + $4 = $36.

After another 2 months (10 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 10 months is $36 + $4 = $40.

After another 2 months (12 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 12 months is $40 + $4 = $44.

After another 2 months (14 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 14 months is $44 + $4 = $48.

After another 2 months (16 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 16 months is $48 + $4 = $52.

So, the price after 18 months is $52 + $4 = $56.

After another 2 months (20 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 20 months is $56 + $4 = $60.

After another 2 months (22 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 22 months is $60 + $4 = $64.

After another 2 months (24 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 24 months is $64 + $4 = $68.

After another 2 months (26 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 26 months is $68 + $4 = $72.

After another 2 months (28 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4. 
So, the price after 28 months is $72 + $4 = $76.

After another 2 months (30 months total), the price increases by 20% of the original price again, which is $4.

It takes 5 seconds to cut a potato. 

So, the total time to peel and cut a potato is 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. 

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by 60. 

95 * 60 = 5700 seconds.

They made $25 in profit. To find the total amount they made, we need to add the cost of making the lemonade to the profit. The cost of making each gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which is $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon.

Let's say they made x gallons. Then, the total amount they made is $10x and the total cost is $5x. The profit is the total amount they made minus the total cost, which is $10x - $5x = $5x.

Since they made $25 in profit, we can set up the equation $5x = $25. Solving for x, we get x = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5.

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5. Since Jerry is rolling the die twice, we need to multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Now, let's compare the probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25. To find the difference, subtract 0.25 from 0.5: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. This will give us the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats. 140 - 50 = 90.

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages of rats. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 6 * number of rats in each cage * 3. We can set up an equation: 6 * number of rats in each cage * 3 = 90.

Now, we can solve for the number of rats in each cage. Divide both sides of the equation by 6 * 3. This gives us: number of rats in each cage = 90 / (6 * 3) = 90 / 18 = 5.

"To find the answer, let's break it down step by step.

On Friday, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back 1/3 of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted them white and put them back. So now there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So now there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has, we need to calculate the cards she collected each month and add them to her initial cards.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add all the cards: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher and then multiply that by the rate each publisher pays.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, and he edits 1000 sentences in total, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns 500 x 5 = 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 5 x 2 = 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns 500 x 10 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amount he earns from each publisher: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To find out how much John made that year, we need to calculate his total salary before the raise and after the raise, then add the one-time reward.

John makes $2000 a week. There are 52 weeks in a year. So, his total salary before the raise is:
$2000 * 52 = $104,000

Since John got a 5% raise, we need to calculate 5% of his weekly salary:
$2000 * 0.05 = $100

So, his new weekly salary is:
$2000 + $100 = $2100

His total salary after the raise is:
$2100 * 51 = $107,100 (since he got the raise on the first day of the year, he gets the raise for 51 weeks)

"Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, so that's 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, that's 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese.

He also used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.

Janet already had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So, the total number of pens she already had is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag. So, the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag. So, the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the five tests that will be counted. 

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will remove the lowest score of 71. The remaining scores are 89, 92, 100, and 86. 

We want the average of these five tests (including the sixth test) to be 93. Since there are five tests, we multiply 93 by 5 to get the total score needed: 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, we add up the scores of the four tests that we know: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the total score of the four tests from the total score needed: 465 - 367 = 98.

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers for the first 4 weeks and the last 3 weeks separately.

For the first 4 weeks:
Micheal rode 5 times a week, so in 4 weeks, he rode 5 * 4 = 20 times.
Each time he rode 25 kilometers, so the total kilometers for the first 4 weeks is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

For the last 3 weeks:
Micheal rode 2 times a week, so in 3 weeks, he rode 2 * 3 = 6 times.
Each time he rode 60 kilometers, so the total kilometers for the last 3 weeks is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers for the first 4 weeks and the last 3 weeks:

"To find the weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to find the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples, then add them together.

The weight of each chocolate bar is 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 x 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 x 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To find the cost of each cup, we need to first find the total cost of 20 dozen cups. 

First, let's find the cost of half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The cost of 6 plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, 20 dozen is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 

Now, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. The cost of each cup is $34800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how much money Sara needs, we need to add the cost of the jacket and the shoes. The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 x $20 = $40. So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved. She also earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 x $5 = $20 from babysitting. Now, she has $10 + $20 = $30.

Since Sara needs $70 and she already has $30, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns each time ($4). $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from the red chickens is 3x. The white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from the white chickens is 5(x + 2).

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 4

So Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to find the distance around the park and then divide it by his speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Length (l) = 6 miles
Width (w) = 1.5 miles

Perimeter = 2(l + w)
Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's speed to find the time he spends walking.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Now, let's add the customers from the first two days: 
100 + 150 = 250 customers.

We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. 
To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day:

"Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, each pool would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

So, the small pool now has x - 16 gallons of water, and the big pool now has 2x - 16 gallons of water.

We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 16 to both sides gives:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtracting 4x from both sides gives:

-2x = -48

Dividing both sides by -2 gives:

x = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, it now has:

24 - 16 = 8

10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.
So, the total amount she needs to pay is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months. She will pay $165 a month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay to find her remaining balance.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes.

Mike has 5 pen pals initially, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals left.

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, he writes 2 letters to each of the 3 pen pals, making a total of 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes is 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls. So, the total minutes used are:
450 minutes (boss calls) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his total plan:
1000 minutes (total plan) - 750 minutes (total used) = 250 minutes

"To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know Griffin had 27 fries in the end. Colby took 3 less than Kyle, and Kyle took 5 fries. So Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Now, before Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 27 + 2 = 29 fries.

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.

Before Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had 29 + 10 = 39 fries.

Before Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had 39 + 5 = 44 fries.

But we know Griffin started with 24 fries. So, the difference between 44 and 24 is the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

Since the difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation: 
2 * (number of fish in each aquarium) * 2 = 28 (since there are 2 aquariums with the same number of fish)

Combine like terms: 
4 * (number of fish in each aquarium) = 28

Divide both sides by 4: 
number of fish in each aquarium = 28 / 4
number of fish in each aquarium = 7

We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we need to first find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying by 400.

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the weight after the termites ate 30% of the tree.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"

The total number of fruits is the sum of the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have. 
Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, for a total of 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and the rosette take. 

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, so the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. We also know the number of stitches for the body, the collar, and the rosette. 

So, the total number of stitches for the body, the collar, and the rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the sweater has two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, the collar, and the rosette from the total number of stitches for the whole sweater, then divide by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve.

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes. 
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. 
So, Sunday + Monday = 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply 39 by 2.

39 * 2 = 78

"To find the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded, the front and back of each page are paired together. Since there are 32 pages, we can divide this number by 2 to find the number of pairs, and then by 2 again for the front and back of each pair, but then we must multiply by 2 for the front and back of the paper, and then divide by 2 for the front and back of the paper being the same piece of paper.

However, a simpler way to think about it is that each piece of paper has 4 pages (2 on the front and 2 on the back). 

So, we can divide the total number of pages (32) by 4 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 / 4 = 8

"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, so that's $50 / 2 = $25 spent on food and snacks. She also spent $10 on rides. 

So, the total amount spent is $25 + $10 = $35. 

To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to find out how many books she sold in the second year. 

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books, and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books she sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books she sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonuses.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours a week. 
He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. There are 4 weeks in April, so his total bonus is 4 * $300 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month. His total earnings from his hourly wage are 4 * $500 = $2000. Adding his total bonus, his total earnings for the month are $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find two-thirds of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 3.

(60 * 2) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left.

60 (total loaves) - 40 (loaves sold in the morning) = 20 loaves left

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. To find half of 20, we divide 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

Since half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon and 10 loaves are sold in the evening.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he lost (8 pounds) by the number of weeks (4). 

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight in 4 weeks that Joey loses in 1 week, we can multiply the weight Joey loses in a week by 4 to find out how much weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.

2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

Now, we know that Sandy loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to find out how many 4-week periods it will take for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy also loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

For the ice cream, the original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we're buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we're buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate his total expenses first.

6 business suits at $100 each will cost 6 * $100 = $600.
3 suitcases at $50 each will cost 3 * $50 = $150.
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500.
So the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.
Total expenses so far are $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.
He also wants to save $2000 for the trip.
So his total expenses and savings will be $1950 + $2000 = $3950.
He started with $6000, so he has $6000 - $3950 = $2050 left to spend on gifts.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We also know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Finally, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the population of Chile now is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of players on each team. 

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. 
Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. 
There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up an equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."

Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H
Volume = 6 x 4 x 5

Now, we add this extra distance to his original daily distance.
5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.

Since there are 30 days in June, we multiply the daily distance by 30.
6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The total distance covered in June is 180,000 meters."
"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B. 
Juice Box C is 11 dollars and Juice Box B is 9 dollars, so the difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the cookies her son and husband eat from the total number of cookies.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 x 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

The total number of cookies in the bag is 36.

So, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to multiply the cost of one shirt by 2. 
The cost of one shirt is $30, so 2 shirts cost 2 x $30 = $60.

Since Davos got a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $60 and subtract it from $60. 
40% of $60 is 0.4 x $60 = $24.

Now, we subtract $24 from $60 to get the final price Davos paid: 
$60 - $24 = $36.

"To find the percentage more they're making per day now, we need to first find out how much they used to make per day and how much they make now.

They used to make 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor, so they used to make 10 * $100 = $1000 per day.

Now, they sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo, so they make 5 * $220 = $1100 per day.

To find the difference, we subtract the old amount from the new amount: $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage more, we divide the difference by the old amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost first. 

The cost of food per month is $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

The cost of treats per month is $20.

The cost of medicine per month is $100.

So, the total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total yearly cost is $220 * 12 = $2640.

Tuesday: 3 times the yoga class, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours (cooking class)
Wednesday: 0.5 hours (cheese-tasting event)
Thursday: half as long as the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours (museum tour)
Friday: 2 hours (errands)

Now, let's add up the hours:

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to first find out how many plant pots she gave to the school.

The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies. They also asked for twice as many for the roses, which is 2 x 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

So, the total number of plant pots the school asked for is 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

April had 100 plant pots. She gave 90 to the school. To find out how many she has left, we subtract 90 from 100.

100 - 90 = 10

"To find the total time John spent, we need to first find the total time he spent on the activities we know about. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 
So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so to find the total time, we need to divide 15 by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form). 
15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so to find the time spent sightseeing, we multiply 50 by 0.4 (which is 40% in decimal form). 
50 * 0.4 = 20 hours.

"To find out how much Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much she has earned and add it to her initial savings.

At her first job, Annabelle earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours. So, she earns 10 * 20 = $200.

At her second job, Annabelle earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. So, she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

In total, Annabelle earns 200 + 75 = $275.

Adding this to her initial savings of $80, Annabelle now has 275 + 80 = $355.

The phone costs $400, so Annabelle still needs 400 - 355 = $45.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the height of the second tree: 
   The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. 
   The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

2. Find the combined height of the shortest and second tree:
   The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 11 feet tall. 
   So, the combined height is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

3. Find the height of the tallest tree:
   The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. 
   So, the height of the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate how much he spent and subtract that from the total amount of money he had, then add the extra $10 his mom gave him.

Dean bought 6 toy cars for $2 each, so he spent 6 x $2 = $12 on toy cars.
He bought 5 teddy bears for $1 each, so he spent 5 x $1 = $5 on teddy bears.
In total, Dean spent $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean started with $28 and spent $17, so he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.
Then his mom gave him an extra $10, so now he has $11 + $10 = $21.

$90 / $30 = 3

So Morgan can invite 2 friends, because she also needs to include herself in the total number of people."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves each day, we need to subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money. 

First, let's find the total cost of the lollipops. 
4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents
Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, the total cost of the lollipops is $1.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the lollipops from Marisa's daily pocket money.
$5 - $1 = $4

So, Marisa saves $4 each day. To find out how much she saves in 5 days, we multiply the amount she saves each day by 5.

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs for $.05 each. So, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * .05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, that means he had $4 in change. 

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4.

2x - 5 = 45

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:
2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides by 2:
2x / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, the son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to find the distance from the third city to the first city. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The combined distance is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance the train travels in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (900 miles). 

18,000 / 900 = 20

   So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

3. Three times the number of shoplifters (7) were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
   3 * 7 = 21

   So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, let's add up the customers kicked out for these reasons:
3 (masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

"To find out how much money Tim saves, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and subtract that from the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is 2 * $10 = $20. 
20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

The cost of the cable package is $60. 
So, the amount of money Tim saves is $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first find the total time she spent working. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. 
She spent half of 4 hours recording it, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours. 
She spent 90 minutes editing it. To convert 90 minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the total time she spent working: 
4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we divide the time spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total time (7.5 hours) and multiply by 100: 
(1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to add the cards she made and the cards her dad brought her, then subtract the cards she passed out, and finally add the cards she received.

Erica made 20 cards. 
Her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so that's 2 x 15 = 30 cards.
So, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so that's 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
Now, Erica has 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so now Erica has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"To find out how many slices are left, we need to first find out how many slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of 12 is 4 slices.

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of 12 is 3 slices.

So, Jenny gave a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices to Bill and Mark.

Now, Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

The pizza had 12 slices initially. So, the number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3.

There are 12 months in a year. The builder works 4 weeks every month, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so that's correct. He works 6 days a week.

So, the builder works 4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 24 days/month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the builder works 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.

The builder earns $50/day, so in a year, he earns 288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400.

For milk, 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find the energy saved, we need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days at the original time and the reduced time, then find the difference.

First, let's find the energy used in 30 days at the original time (8 hours/day):
Energy = Power x Time
Power = 900 watts = 0.9 kilowatts (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts)
Time = 8 hours/day x 30 days = 240 hours
Energy = 0.9 kilowatts x 240 hours = 216 kilowatt-hours

Now, let's find the energy used in 30 days at the reduced time (3 hours/day):
Time = 3 hours/day x 30 days = 90 hours
Energy = 0.9 kilowatts x 90 hours = 81 kilowatt-hours

Now, let's find the energy saved:
Energy saved = Original energy - Reduced energy
Energy saved = 216 kilowatt-hours - 81 kilowatt-hours
Energy saved = 135 kilowatt-hours

20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat would be:
5 * $7.00 = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese would be:

"Let's break this down step by step.

Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis initially. He has 40 cannolis, so he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Then, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, which is 60. So, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, he has 80 (initial corns) + 20 (new corns) = 100 corns.

The total number of cannolis is 100, and the total number of corns is 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He has 2,000 steps left after the jog. So, before the jog, he had taken 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

We know that Elliott finished half of his steps (10,000 / 2 = 5,000) on his walks to and from school. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before the jog, he had taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, we subtract the steps he took before the jog from the total steps he had taken before the jog (including the jog). 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000.

The book is 45 pages long and has an average of 200 words per page. So, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed: 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, the total time Toby will need is 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total amount paid to each employee in a week is 40 hours * $15/hour = $600. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. The total amount paid to all 40 employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. The total amount paid to each employee in June is the same as in May, which is $2400. The total amount paid to all 30 employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. The total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total amount she spent: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $1200. 20% is the same as 0.20, so we multiply $1200 by 0.20 to get $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. So, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

50000 * 0.05 = 2500

So, 2500 candles smell like wet dog.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that explode. 1% of the candles explode (since they are 99% guaranteed not to explode). To find 1% of 2500, we multiply 2500 by 0.01.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathered twice as many, so her sister gathered 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathered half as many apples from the shortest trees as she did from the tallest trees. Half of 30 is 15, so Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered 3 times as many, so her sister gathered 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Now we know how many apples the sisters gathered from the tallest and shortest trees. Joanne gathered 30 + 15 = 45 apples from these trees. Her sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples from these trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 45 + 105 = 150 apples.

The sisters gathered a total of 500 apples, so the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

Since Joanne's sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, all 350 apples from the average trees were gathered by Joanne.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. Let's say the number of camels is 'c' and the number of dromedaries is 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can say that c + d = 180 (since each animal has one head).

We also know that there are 304 humps in total. Since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can say that 2c + d = 304.

Now we have two equations:
1) c + d = 180
2) 2c + d = 304

We can solve these equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
This simplifies to c = 124.

Now that we know the number of camels (c), we can find the number of dromedaries (d) by substituting c into one of the original equations:
c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Since this is the total distance for 2 days, we don't need to multiply it by the number of days.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Kenny spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have made $100 + $50 = $150.

Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price of each card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he sold:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 * x.

We know that the number of cards he sold is 100, so we can set up the equation:

2/3 * x = 100

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

The total number of hotdogs prepared is (18 * 2) + 18 = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. 
This means the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short is 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest needs 1 hotdog to have a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Three quarters of 100 is 3/4 * 100 = 75.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Twice 75 is 2 * 75 = 150.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. One-fifth of 150 is 1/5 * 150 = 30.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to do a few steps.

First, we need to find out how many gallons of gas were in each container. Since 15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5.

15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons per container

Now, we know Josey needed 1/4 of a container. Since each container has 3 gallons, we multiply 3 by 1/4.

3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon. So, we multiply 3/4 by 8.

(3/4) * 8 = 6 pints

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to first find out how much money he spent on chips and then subtract that from the total amount he spent.

George bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips.

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and had 1% of his money left, he spent 500 - (1% of 500) cents. 1% of 500 is 5 cents, so he spent 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the amount he spent on chips from the total amount he spent: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar: 375 / 75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to first find out how many lollipops Ray shared. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

He shared the 20 lollipops equally with his 4 friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide 20 by 4.

20 / 4 = 5

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake. 

First, we need to find the weight of one piece of cake. Since the cake is cut into 8 pieces, we divide the total weight by 8:
20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces in total. The weight of the two pieces eaten is:
2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake:
20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 
Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Now, they want to share these oranges equally with their 6 other friends. This means the oranges will be shared among 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people.
Oranges per person = Total oranges / Number of people
Oranges per person = 56 / 8
Oranges per person = 7

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions cost $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which cost $2.00 per box, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to find out how long it takes her to get to the theater. 

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and it takes Bernadette 4 times as long as Wayne, we multiply 4 minutes by 4. 
4 * 4 = 16 minutes

So, it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater. 

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to find the difference in their travel times and add 5 minutes to that. 
The difference in their travel times is 16 - 4 = 12 minutes.

Now, we add 5 minutes to that. 
12 + 5 = 17 minutes

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to know the length and width of the room. We already know the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 yards by 3 feet per yard.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now we know the length of the room is 9 feet. We also know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length * width. We can use this formula to find the width of the room.

Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now we know the length and width of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width). We can use this formula to find the perimeter of the room.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of beads in each pack.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. So, she has 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads. Since each pack has 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 * 20 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. So, she has 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads. Since each pack has 20 beads, Margareth has 7 * 20 = 140 beads.

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. To do this, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature after baking and then after opening the window.

The house starts at 40 degrees. 
Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the temperature increases by 5 degrees each hour. 
So, the temperature increase is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
The new temperature is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. 
The temperature decreases by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes it decreases by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
The final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete the swim and bike ride.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. James finished the swim 10% faster. 10% of 40 is 4, so James finished the swim 4 minutes faster. 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike ride time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James took 5 minutes longer, so James' bike ride time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon. Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, bike ride time is 80 minutes, and run time is 50 minutes. So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to do the run. James' swim time is 36 minutes, bike ride time is 85 minutes, and total time is 180 minutes. So, James' run time is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to find the length of Movie B first. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we need to convert it to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

Movie A = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, and it runs 16 miles, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails of hay will cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the money Michael has: 
$30 - $24 = $6

Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12, 4 dozen is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs, so she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs in total.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses. So each tray needs 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.

Now, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed for each tray. 50 / 25 = 2.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the sneakers and subtract the cost of the sneakers.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 * $20 = $340 from the flash sale.

He had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, which he sold for $25 each. So, he made 31 * $25 = $775 from selling the rest of the sneakers.

In total, the salesman made $340 + $775 = $1115.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the sneakers from the total amount of money he made: $1115 - $576 = $539.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the total cost of the super ticket with popcorn and soda. 

The super ticket costs $20 and the popcorn and soda cost $1 extra, so the total cost is $20 + $1 = $21.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the regular ticket with popcorn and soda. The regular ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3. Let's call the regular price of popcorn 'x'. The total cost is $12 + $3 + x.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular ticket with popcorn and soda should be $21 - $2 = $19.

Now, we can set up an equation: $12 + $3 + x = $19.

Combine the constants: $15 + x = $19.

Subtract $15 from both sides: x = $4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. To find the cost of one balloon, we divide $900 by 20.

$900 / 20 = $45 per balloon

Two days later, the cost of each balloon was increased by $20. So the new cost of one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the cost of one balloon by 170.

$65 * 170 = $11,050

"To find the total cost of the potting soil, we need to find out how many cubic feet of soil Bob needs and then divide that by the amount of soil in each bag.

First, we need to find the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (like the raised bed) is found by multiplying the length, width, and height. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10.

Total volume = 32 * 10
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Now, we need to find out how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.

Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 / 2

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the total number of kids who are allergic to something and subtract that from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy (9) and the number of kids allergic to peanuts (6). However, we have counted the kids who are allergic to both twice, so we need to subtract 3 to avoid double-counting.

9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12

Now, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class.

32 (total kids) - 12 (kids allergic to something) = 20

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to find 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price. 
20% of $1500 is 0.20 x $1500 = $300.
So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.
For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is $10,000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15,400.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow tubes he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes Jasper has: 2 + 9 = 11.

"To find out how many songs Luri can add, we first need to find out how many songs Luri has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we multiply 20 by 3 to get Luri's total songs.

Luri's total songs = 20 * 3 = 60

Now, we need to find out how many songs each of them can add. Since the maximum capacity is 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs they already have from 100.

Songs Gabriel can add = 100 - 20 = 80
Songs Luri can add = 100 - 60 = 40

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel. To do this, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add.

Fewer songs Luri can add = 80 - 40 = 40

So, he runs 12 * 5 = 60 miles a week.

Now, we know James runs 10 miles an hour. 
To find out how many hours he runs a week, we need to divide the total miles he runs a week by the miles he runs an hour.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses will eat in five days.

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they eat twice a day, so each horse eats 5 x 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, they eat a total of 10 x 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.

For 5 days, they will eat 40 x 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, Uncle Ben will need 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

First, we know Jana has 27 puppies and two thirds of them are Pomeranians. To find two thirds of 27, we multiply 27 by 2 and then divide by 3.

(27 * 2) / 3 = 54 / 3 = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we know one third of the Pomeranians are girls. To find one third of 18, we divide 18 by 3.

18 / 3 = 6

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but because of the buy one get one free deal, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack has 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we need to convert the total cost to cents. $2.00 is equal to 200 cents.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost in cents by the total number of razors: 200 cents / 8 razors = 25 cents per razor.

"To find out how many oranges Ashley brought, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges in each box. 
Ashley brought 5 boxes * 10 oranges per box = 50 oranges.

Since Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, we add 20 to Ashley's total oranges.
Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

Now, we add Ashley's and Brianne's oranges to find the total number of oranges.
Total oranges = 50 (Ashley) + 70 (Brianne) = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by 3.

"To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's say the number of guests is 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest, including food).

Since we want to find the point where the costs are equal, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, let's solve for 'x':

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We also know that the total number of insects they found is 43. So, we can set up the equation:
x + x/2 + (x/2 + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:
x + x/2 + x/2 = 43 - 7
x + x = 36
2x = 36
x = 18

So Bodhi found 18 insects. 
David found half of that, which is 18/2 = 9 insects.
Lily found 7 more than David, which is 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

364 * 1/4 = 364 / 4 = 91 yards

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We multiply 364 by 1/2.

Daily consumption after: 14 * 24 = 336 kilowatt-hours

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
Weekly consumption before: 288 * 7 = 2016 kilowatt-hours
Weekly consumption after: 336 * 7 = 2352 kilowatt-hours

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:
Weekly bill before: 2016 * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly bill after: 2352 * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is: $3528 - $3024 = $504"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, if one person can paint half a house in 5 days, that means one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since 2 halves make a whole).

Next, we need to find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is equal to 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Total sofas = 20 (Ophelia) + 64 (Jenna) = 84 sofas
Total chairs = 22 (Ophelia) + 66 (Jenna) = 88 chairs

Total number of sofas and chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost. 

The total cost was $48, and the CD cost $4. So, the headphone set cost $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. We can do this by dividing $44 by the cost of one CD, which is $4.

$44 / $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours for the weeks he spent 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

Josh spent 4 hours for 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks (since he spent 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week). 
So, 5 weeks * 4 hours = 20 hours.

He spent 5 hours for 2 weeks, so 2 weeks * 5 hours = 10 hours.

He spent 6 hours for 1 week.

Now, we add the hours: 20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours.

"Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of people left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that is:
5 * 8 = 40

So, 40 people get on the bus. Now the total number of people is:
40 (initial) + 40 (new) = 80

On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of people left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer means 21 / 3 = 7 people get on.

Now the total number of people is:
59 (initial) + 7 (new) = 66

"To find Jame's current age, we need to subtract 5 years from 27. 
27 - 5 = 22 years old, which is Jame's current age.

In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. 
Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60 years old.
5 years younger than that is 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Since Jame's cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years, we need to subtract 8 years to find his current age.
55 - 8 = 47 years old, which is Jame's cousin's current age.

Now, we need to find the difference between Jame's current age and his cousin's current age.
47 - 22 = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, we can find the cost of the printer by subtracting $400 from $1,100.

Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400 = $700

Now, we know that Errol spent a total of $2,400 on the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Cost of computer + Cost of 2 monitors + Cost of printer = $2,400
$1,100 + 2x + $700 = $2,400

Combine the constants:
$1,800 + 2x = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides:
2x = $600

Divide both sides by 2:
x = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the boys brought in total and then how many seashells the girls brought in total.

Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 x 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is 600 + (4 x 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000.

Now, to find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 3000 / 10 = 300.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to find out how much he needs to save each day in the first half.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

Let's say Elvis saves x dollars each day in the first half. Then, he saves 2x dollars each day in the second half.

The total amount Elvis saves in the first half is 15x dollars, and the total amount he saves in the second half is 15 * 2x = 30x dollars.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in the month is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

So Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2 * 25 = 50 dollars each day in the second half.

"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate how much she will remove in 2 years and subtract that from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, let's subtract the amount she removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf. 
The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. 
So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

The revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each is 10 x $7.00 = $70.00.

The net profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to find out how many muffin crayons she can make. 

There are 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayons is 3 x 64 = 192 crayons.

Since each muffin crayon is made from 8 small pieces of crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of muffin crayons: 192 / 8 = 24.

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find the total amount of money Kate can make: 24 x $1.50 = $36.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot * 216 square feet = $432.
The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot * 216 square feet = $864.
The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot * 216 square feet = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.

"To find the percentage that Maggie's oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
The percentage is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set her oven to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees. Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to subtract 4% of 520 from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.
So, Maggie should set her oven to 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 degrees.

Since 1 box has 90 contacts and lasts 45 days, 2 boxes will have 180 contacts and last 90 days. 

The cost of each pair of contacts is:

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate how much each of them earned.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 x 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 x 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since they are paid $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 x $10 = $30 and John earned 7 x $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running. 

She did aerobics for 2 hours, burning 500 calories per hour. So, she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

She did running for 1 hour, burning 600 calories per hour. So, she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many times 200 calories fit into 1600 calories. 

1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the result by 100 ml to find out how many ml of water she needs to drink.

8 * 100 = 800 ml.

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x. 
Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:
0.99x + x + 1.01x = 4500

Combine like terms:
2.99x + 0.01x = 4500
3x = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 1500

Now we know the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. 
The number of red jelly beans is 0.99x = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.
The number of green jelly beans is 1.01x = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30.

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. In 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is the weight gained from eating donuts minus the weight lost from eating Cheerios. However, since one is a gain and the other is a loss, we add the two values to find the difference: 8.75 + 6.25 = 15.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per day, we need to first find out how many grams of protein are in 200 grams of mushrooms. 

Since 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can find the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms by setting up a proportion. 

Let's set up a proportion: 
100 grams of mushrooms / 3 grams of protein = 200 grams of mushrooms / x grams of protein

We can then cross multiply: 
100x = 200 * 3
100x = 600
x = 600 / 100
x = 6 grams of protein per 200 grams of mushrooms

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, he gets 6 grams of protein per day. 

To find out how many grams of protein he gets per week, we multiply the amount of protein he gets per day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

"Let's break this down step by step.

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means if he was x years old 5 years ago, he is 2x years old now.

Subtract x from both sides: 5 = x

So Jerry was 5 years old 5 years ago. That means he is 5 + 5 = 10 years old now.

In 3 years, Jerry will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

So the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can find the total number of pumps by multiplying 120 by 2, then dividing by 2 to get the number of washings per pump, then multiply that by 2 to get the total number of pumps. 

120 * 2 = 240, then 240 / 2 = 120, then 120 * 2 = 240. 

However, we can just multiply 120 by 2 to get the total number of pumps.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. Since the initial cost was $100,000 for 5 months, the initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.

The cost per month for the remaining months is $20,000 + (50% of $20,000) = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used and multiply it by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

"To find the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to add up the cost of the aquarium, rocks, coral, fish, and fish food.

The aquarium cost $10.00.
The 2 bags of rocks cost 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.
The 3 pieces of coral cost 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.
The 20 fish cost 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.
The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
$10.00 + $5.00 = $15.00
$15.00 + $6.00 = $21.00

"To find the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to calculate its height after each week.

In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so we multiply 3 by 2: 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so we add 4 to the height after the second week: 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate how many hours it will take him to sell 750kg of meat and then divide that by the number of hours he works per day.

Prince sells 15kg of meat per hour. To find out how many hours it will take him to sell 750kg of meat, we divide 750 by 15.

750 kg / 15 kg/hour = 50 hours

Since Prince works 10 hours a day, we divide the total hours by the number of hours he works per day.

50 hours / 10 hours/day = 5 days

Administrators = 72 / 4 = 18

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Parents = 54 / 3 = 18

"To find the total number of street lights, we need to multiply the number of poles at each intersection by the number of intersections, then multiply that by the number of street lights on each pole.

Number of poles at each intersection: 6
Number of intersections: 4
Number of street lights on each pole: 4

Total number of poles = 6 poles/intersection * 4 intersections = 24 poles
Total number of street lights = 24 poles * 4 street lights/pole = 96 street lights

Since 20 street lights are not working, we subtract them from the total number of street lights:
96 - 20 = 76

"To find out how many times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to find out how many times each DVD can still be played, then add those numbers together.

The first DVD has been played 356 times, and it can be played 1000 times before it breaks. So, it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

The second DVD has been played 135 times, and it can be played 1000 times before it breaks. So, it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can still be played: 644 + 865 = 1509.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day. 

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours at school. Since the school day is 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Then, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps 7 pieces for himself.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that 1 Mb has 1000 kb. So, we can convert 20 kb per second to Mb per second by dividing 20 by 1000.

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute and 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, there are 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in 1 hour.

Multiply 0.02 Mb/second by 3600 seconds/hour to get Mb/hour.

0.02 Mb/second x 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

In the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days to find the total number of cars towed:

"To find out how many years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to convert the height requirement to inches (since Adam's height is given in inches) and then calculate how many inches Adam needs to grow.

The height requirement is 4 feet, which is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Adam's current height is 40 inches. To find out how many inches he needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:
48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we divide the number of inches he needs to grow by his growth rate:
8 / 2 = 4 years

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find 10% of that profit.

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars. 
30% of $25,000 is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500. 
So, the cost price of each car is $7,500.

The profit from each car is the selling price minus the cost price: 
$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. 
10% of $175,000 is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 (which is the same as 25%).

100 x 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 x 0.6 = 15

So, 15 women can stay upright. To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

Now, we need to find the price of the silver Jewell. The price of the silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of the gold Jewell.

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - $400
Price of silver Jewell = $1600 - $400
Price of silver Jewell = $1200

Now, we need to find the total price of all three Jewells.

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the 75-mile gap between them.

Since Bob is driving 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving 70 miles per hour, Tom is driving 15 miles per hour faster than Bob (70 - 55 = 15).

So, the 75-mile gap will be covered at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

To find the time, we can divide the distance (75 miles) by the rate (15 miles per hour).

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to first find out the maximum amount his parents are willing to pay per class, which is $10. 

Since Manny signed up for 10 classes for $60, we can find the cost per class by dividing the total cost by the number of classes: $60 / 10 classes = $6 per class.

However, his parents will only pay up to $10 per class. If Manny misses some classes, the cost per class will increase. We need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's say Manny misses x classes. Then, the number of classes he attends is 10 - x. The total cost is still $60, so the cost per class is $60 / (10 - x).

We want to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. We can set up the equation:

$60 / (10 - x) = $10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x):

$60 = $10(10 - x)
$60 = $100 - $10x
$10x = $100 - $60
$10x = $40
x = $40 / $10
x = 4

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Now, we add the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hangar for a year, and the cost of fuel for a year:
$150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000

"To find the total time it took to cook all the food, we need to find the cooking time for each item and add them together.

First, we know it took 30 minutes to cook rice. 
Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.
Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the cooking time for each item: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is 1/2 * $10 = $5.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is 1/3 * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is 1/5 * $10 = $2.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is 1/3 * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

The difference in cost between the two mixtures is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Let's say the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'. 

Since the total number of animal legs is 70, we can write an equation: 
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each animal has one head, we can write another equation:
s + g = 20

Now, we can solve these two equations. We can multiply the second equation by 2 to make it easier to work with:
2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation to get:
2s = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
s = 15

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours of class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours by 1.5 hours per recipe: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes.

Now, we need to find out how many inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We subtract the current height from the desired height.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the number of inches it needs to grow by the growth rate.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's say the age of one twin is 'x'. Since there's another twin, the combined age of the twins is 2x.

Now, we know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. So, the age of that triplet is x - 7. Since there are two more triplets, let's say their ages are also y and z. But since they are triplets, we can assume y = z = x - 7.

The combined age of the triplets is 3(x - 7).

Now, the combined ages of the twins and the triplets is 44. We can write this as an equation:

2x + 3(x - 7) = 44

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x + 3x - 21 = 44

Combine like terms:

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write an equation:

To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:

The three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds. To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the weight that Gissela and Gordy's trucks can haul from the total weight. 

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

"To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to find out how many dumplings the males and females ate.

We know that there are 6 females and each female ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

We also know that there are 8 males, including Larry, and each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Now, we add the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked. 
Total dumplings = 18 (females) + 32 (males) = 50.

"To find out how much money Gerald had, we need to find out how much he got from the $100. The ratio is 3:2, so we can add 3 + 2 = 5 parts. 

Now, we divide $100 by 5 parts to find out how much 1 part is. $100 / 5 = $20 per part.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we multiply 3 x $20 = $60. 

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract $10 from $60. $60 - $10 = $50.

"To find out how many hours they have to fundraise in total, we need to find out how much they raise per hour and then divide the total amount they need to raise by the hourly amount.

They raised $2100 in 3 hours. To find the hourly amount, we divide $2100 by 3 hours:
$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise $6300 at $700 per hour:
$6300 / $700 per hour = 9 hours

They have already fundraised for 3 hours, so we subtract that from the total hours:
9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

They need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes.

Colorado City uses 40% of the river's total water. 
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. 
So, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes is 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city.

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the quarts made per hour for each flavor and then multiply by 48.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. So, the quarts made per hour is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. So, the quarts made per hour is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total quarts made in 48 hours for each flavor:
- Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
- Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

The total quarts made in 48 hours is 2400 + 600 = 3000.

The cost of 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00.
The cost of 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, let's add the cost of all the items together: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus gets 10% off his purchase, so we need to calculate 10% of $50.00. 
10% of $50.00 is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00.

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we find out how many people receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews get a job offer, we multiply 30 by 0.2.
30 * 0.2 = 6

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we find out how many people accept the position. Since a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position, we divide 6 by 3.

When her arms are raised, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot. Since she does this for 2 minutes, the total taps with arms raised is:
200 taps/minute * 2 minutes * 2 feet = 800 taps

When her arms are at her sides, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps with arms at her sides is:
(300 + 250) taps/minute * 3 minutes = 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps

There were 5 pizzas in total (Bryce and 4 friends). Each pizza had 12 slices, so the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 2/3 of 3 pizzas. 2/3 of 3 pizzas is 2 pizzas. 2 pizzas have 2 x 12 = 24 slices.

The 2 remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate ¾ of 2 pizzas. ¾ of 2 pizzas is 1.5 pizzas. 1.5 pizzas have 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices.

In total, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

Now, let's use the information given: Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call Bobby's shoe length 'x'. Then, the equation is 9x + 10 = 100.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 100 - 10, 9x = 90.

"To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have, we need to first find out how many marbles each of them has.

We know Sean has 56 marbles. Since Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean, Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

We also know Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have to find the total. 
Carl's marbles: 224
Cal's marbles: 112
Total marbles: 224 + 112 = 336

"To find out how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students are in each group. Since there are 54 students and 6 groups, we divide 54 by 6.

54 ÷ 6 = 9 students per group.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find out how many students will be in 12 groups. Since each group has 9 students, we multiply 9 by 12.

9 * 12 = 108 students.

However, we only have 54 students. So, we need to find out how many groups we can make with 54 students if we want 12 groups. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we will divide 54 by the number of students per group in 12 groups.

To find the number of students per group in 12 groups, we divide 54 by 12.

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5 students per group.

However, we already know that we can make 6 groups of 9 students each. So, we will compare the number of groups we have (6) with the number of groups we need (12).

6 (groups we have) is less than 12 (groups we need). So, we need more groups.

To find out how many more groups we need, we subtract the number of groups we have from the number of groups we need.

12 (groups we need) - 6 (groups we have) = 6

In a week, the total chairs rented on weekdays is 60 * 5 = 300 chairs. 
The total chairs rented on weekends is 100 * 2 = 200 chairs. 
So, in a week, the total chairs rented is 300 + 200 = 500 chairs. 

There are 4 weeks in a month. 
So, in a month, the total chairs rented is 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs. 

Since there are 2 months, the total chairs rented in 2 months is 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.

"To find the number of bananas Gunther found, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Gunther started with 48 bananas. 
Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Arnold stole 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 
Gunther was left with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. 
Arnold stole 12 bananas, so Gunther was left with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to first find out how many he had initially and then subtract the ones that were broken.

1 dozen is equal to 12. So, 
8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Initially, Jeff had 96 glasses and 48 plates.

Now, let's subtract the broken ones:
96 glasses - 10 glasses = 86 glasses
48 plates - 6 plates = 42 plates

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

To find the total number of glasses and plates, we add them together:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers left (30 - 27 = 3) and 40 large stickers.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 20 large buttons, and 20 large stickers left (40 - 20 = 20).

Finally, she trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 20 large buttons, 9 large buttons, and 60 small buttons. In total, she has 29 large buttons (20 + 9) and 60 small buttons, and 3 small stickers. Since a small sticker is worth one small button, we can convert the 3 small stickers to 3 small buttons. 

So she has 29 large buttons and 63 small buttons (60 + 3). 

Since the question asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons. Since a large button is worth 3 small buttons, she has 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons from the large buttons. 

Now she has 87 small buttons from the large buttons and 63 small buttons. In total, she has 87 + 63 = 150 small buttons.

The final answer is: 150"

"Let's break this down step by step. 

We know the total number of cases of shingles needed is 250. We also know the first house needs 1/2 of the second house. Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. Then the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know the total is 250, so we can set up the equation: 
x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms: 
(1/2)x + 2x = 250
(5/2)x = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 
5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5: 
x = 100

Now we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, and the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so the first house needs 100/2 = 50 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles.

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these movies is 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is $10. So, the cost of each movie in series is:

Bob initially had 3 orange and 4 white fish. He then added 17 more fish to his pond.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and the total amount of gas he uses.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 miles x 2 = 10 miles per day.

In a week, Andy drives 10 miles/day x 5 days = 50 miles.

Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons x $3/gallon = $15.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

The amount spent from the quarters is 140 quarters. Since each quarter is $0.25, the total amount spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

The amount spent from the twenties is 3/5 of 10 twenties. First, we need to find 3/5 of 10:
3/5 * 10 = 6

Since each twenty is $20, the total amount spent from the twenties is:
6 * $20 = $120

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount spent:
$35 + $120 = $155

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to find out how many TVs were smart TVs and analog TVs, then subtract that from the total number of TVs sold.

One-fourth of the TVs sold were smart TVs. One-fourth of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10. So, 10 TVs were smart TVs.

One-eighth of the TVs sold were analog TVs. One-eighth of 40 is 40 / 8 = 5. So, 5 TVs were analog TVs.

Now, we add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs: 10 + 5 = 15.

To find the number of OLED TVs, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first find out how much the school is covering. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we need to divide the total cost by 2.

The total cost of the trip is $300. 
Half of the cost is 300 / 2 = 150.

The school is covering $150. 
John has $50. 
So, the total amount of money John has is 150 + 50 = 200.

To find out how much money John is missing, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the total cost of the trip.

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to find out the temperature at night. It was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. 

So, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, we need to heat the house up to at least 32 degrees. 

To find out how many degrees the house needs to be heated, we subtract 12 from 32: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since every log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide 20 by 5 to find out how many logs are needed: 20 / 5 = 4.

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Now, we know that each group has 9 members, and 6 groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. 

6 groups * 9 members per group = 54 members

Since each member brought back 2 seashells, we multiply the number of members by 2.

54 members * 2 seashells per member = 108 seashells

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to calculate the total number of employees and their total salary.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) = 220
220 + 20 (new employees in the second month) = 240
240 + 20 (new employees in the third month) = 260

So, after three months, the company has 260 employees.

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month, we multiply the number of employees by their salary:
260 employees * $4000 per month = $1,040,000 per month

Since we want to find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so her salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230

"To find out how much money is used, we need to find out how many quarters each person used. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes they played. 4 hours is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. So, he used 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They used 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they used 24 x 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 x 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He used 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, we add up all the quarters used: 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total amount of money used is 68 x 25 cents = 1700 cents. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100: 1700 / 100 = 17 dollars.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say the amount of zest is x. Then the amount of fragrance is also x, the amount of salt is 2x, the amount of sugar is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:
x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Combine like terms:
10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
x = 1

Now we know the amount of zest is 1 ounce. The amount of oil is 4x, so it's 4 * 1 = 4 ounces.

"Let's start by using the information that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has. We can represent PJ's cards as x. Then Smendrick's cards will be 3x.

We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick. So Becca's cards will be 3x + 12.

The total number of cards is 341. We can write an equation to represent this:

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3 times that, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that it will take a turtle twice as long to cross the highway as it would a kangaroo.

Time for one turtle = 2 * 6 hours = 12 hours

Since there are four turtles, we need to find the total time it would take all of them to cross the highway. However, since they are all traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for one turtle is the same as the time it takes for all four turtles.

The original cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54. However, we get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the discount is 3 x $2 = $6. 

The cost of 3 baskets of red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

Now, we add the cost of the green food baskets and the cost of the red food baskets to find the total cost: $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find out how many rooms are in one-half of the motel. 

There are 90 rooms in total. One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, to clean 45 rooms, it would take 45 * 20 minutes = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

"To find the total number of homes built, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this number gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the problem states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built so far and build that many more homes. So, in the third year, they will build 96 homes, not have 96 homes in total.

The total number of homes built over the three years is 12 + 36 + 96.

12 + 36 = 48
48 + 96 = 144

"Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say my brother's age is B, my age is A, and my sister's age is S. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, A = B - 3.

Since I am 2 years older than my sister, S = A - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so Mom's age = 3B - 1.

When you add all our ages, you get 87, so A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87.

Now, let's substitute A and S in terms of B:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87
6B - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:
6B = 96

Divide by 6:
B = 16

Now that we know B, we can find A:
A = B - 3
A = 16 - 3
A = 13

The answer is: 13"

Number of students = 27
Number of glue sticks per student = 2
Total glue sticks needed = 27 * 2 = 54

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 and round up to the nearest whole number, because Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs.

Total glue sticks needed = 54
Number of glue sticks per pack = 8
Number of packs needed = 54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number. 
Number of packs needed = 7

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles, so it becomes 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, we add 6000 to 8000: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we multiply Rafaela's tips by 0.1.

10% of Rafaela's tips = 0.1 * 800 = $80

Now, we subtract 10% of Rafaela's tips from Rafaela's total tips to find Julieta's total tips.

Julieta's total tips = 800 - 80 = $720

To find the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips, we add their individual tips.

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. There are 12 months in a year, so Claire earns 1 x 12 = 12 badges per year.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns 6 badges (12 months / 2 months per badge).

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 x 12 = 36 badges per year.

Now, let's compare the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year. Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges. To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find the total distance, we need to find out how far Anis rowed and add it to Dijana's distance. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of 50, we multiply 50 by 1/5. 

50 * 1/5 = 50 * 0.2 = 10 miles

So Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. To find Anis' total distance, we add 10 miles to Dijana's distance.

Anis' distance = 50 + 10 = 60 miles

Now, we add Dijana's distance and Anis' distance to find the total distance.

Total distance = 50 + 60 = 110 miles

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 5 more than Daniel's 13 pages today. So Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. 

Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today. 

Daniel's total pages = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel. 
Denise's total pages - Daniel's total pages = 28 - 13 = 15.

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first find out how much soup will be left after dinner.

Calvin's pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

Since 1 adult bowl is equal to 2 child bowls, 2 adult bowls will be equal to 4 child bowls. So, 2 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife) and 2 child bowls (their children) will be equal to 4 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

Since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls will be left.

There are 2 children, so each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the material needed for small masks and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
To make 20 small masks, she will need 20 / 4 = 5 times the material. 
So, she will need 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material for small masks.

For large masks: 
She can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, she will need 8 / 3 = 2.67 times the material (round up to 3 since you can't use a fraction of material, but we will use 2.67 for calculation). 
So, she will need 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards of material for large masks.

Now, add the material needed for small and large masks: 
10 + 6 = 16 yards of material.

Duncan's age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up an equation:

To find Adam's age four years ago, we can divide both sides by 2:

Adam's age four years ago = 52 / 2 = 26

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since we know Adam's age four years ago, we can add 4 to get his current age:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30

Finally, we need to find Adam's age in 8 years. We can add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break it down into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours to swim the first part.

Then, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles. Since he's going half the speed, his new pace is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. It takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.

The total time it took James to cross the lake is 6 hours (initial swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (final swimming) = 17 hours.

"Let's break it down:

Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, and Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo. This means Dinar scored 10 points less than Bahati, and Azibo scored 20 points less than Bahati.

Let's say Bahati scored x points. Then Dinar scored x - 10 points, and Azibo scored x - 20 points.

We know the total points scored by the team is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 10) + (x - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x - 30 = 45

Add 30 to both sides:
3x = 75

Divide by 3:
x = 25

So Bahati scored 25 points. Since Azibo scored 20 points less than Bahati, Azibo scored 25 - 20 = 5 points.

"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are there from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 

First, let's find out the total hours: 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes to get the total minutes: 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by 15 minutes to get the number of 15-minute intervals: 900 / 15 = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 30 reports: 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She was also sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. We subtract those 23 minutes from the total: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to find 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. Since he has 2 dozen cups, that's 2 x 12 = 24 cups. 

2/3 of 24 is (2/3) * 24 = 16. So Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons. 

If he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups. So the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 + 10 = 34.

"To find the number of unoccupied beds, we first need to find the number of occupied beds. Since 1/5 of the beds are occupied, we multiply 1000 by 1/5.

1000 * 1/5 = 1000 / 5 = 200 beds are occupied.

Now, we subtract the occupied beds from the total beds to find the unoccupied beds.

1000 - 200 = 800 beds are unoccupied.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days.

In 14 days, the number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we subtract the patients admitted from the unoccupied beds.

800 - 700 = 100 beds are unoccupied.

Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, we know Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. We multiply Shawna's age by 5 to get Shawna's father's age.

We know Jason carried 2 balls. 
Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.
Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Now, we add up the number of balls each boy carried to find the total number of balls.
Total number of balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total number of balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total number of balls = 7

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, let's find the total number of holes at the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. They also filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

Now, we can find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day by subtracting the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon.

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, we can write an equation for Stan's Pokémon:

Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13

We know Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write an equation for Alex's Pokémon:

Alex's Pokémon = Stan's Pokémon + 5
= (4x - 13) + 5
= 4x - 8

We know the total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. So, we can set up an equation:

Adelwolfe's Pokémon + Stan's Pokémon + Alex's Pokémon = 339
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon.

Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
= 4(40) - 13
= 160 - 13
= 147

"To find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to find the total number of episodes and multiply it by the length of each episode.

Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can divide the number of minutes per episode by 2 to find the number of episodes. 

Number of minutes per episode = 20
Number of episodes = 20 / 2 = 10

Now, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show.

Total minutes = Number of episodes * Number of minutes per episode
Total minutes = 10 * 20
Total minutes = 200

Distance traveled in the northern direction:
Distance2 = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Distance traveled in the southern direction for the last part of the journey:
Distance3 = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southern direction = Distance1 + Distance3 = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

In total, he sold 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on low is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on high is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net change in temperature is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet the second time, and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. So, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Buford writes a check for the electric bill once a month, so that's 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year. 
He also writes a check for the gas bill once a month, so that's 1 * 12 = 12 checks per year. 
Twice per month he writes a check to the church, so that's 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year. 
And quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 * 1 = 4 checks per year.

"To find out how many flights the first plane makes, we need to know that the second plane makes 44 trips and that is half the number of trips the first plane makes. 

So the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, we know that 3/4 of the trips are to Greece, and the remaining 1/4 is split between France and Germany. 

So, 1/4 of 88 is 88 / 4 = 22. 

Since the remaining 1/4 is split between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to find the length of each wolf's howl and add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4 years old respectively. Let's add those two ages together: 3 + 4 = 7.

Now we have the total age of two of the children. We know the total age of all the children is 20, so we subtract the total age of Akbar and Alessandro from the total age of all the children: 20 - 7 = 13.

Now we know the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13. We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age of the group divided by the number of children in the group. The total age of the group is 20 and the number of children in the group is 4. 

So the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5. 

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so Helene is 2 * 5 = 10 years old.

Now we know the age of Helene, which is 10 years old. We also know the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13. So we subtract the age of Helene from the total age of Helene and Wilfred: 13 - 10 = 3.

Let's say the size of each kid's slice is x. Then, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

Since there are 4 kids and 2 adults, the total number of slices is 4x (for kids) + 2(2x) (for adults) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, each adult gets 2x out of the total 8x slices. To find the percentage, we can divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours.

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Cost per session = $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total earnings per week = $40 * 3 = $120 per week.

Number of female porcupines = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born per female porcupine in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

Total babies born in a year = 48 * 30
Total babies born in a year = 1440

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's add up the total amount of water they pumped:

We also know that large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small stuffed animals. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. This is the sum of the amount earned from small stuffed animals and large stuffed animals.

The amount earned from small stuffed animals is $4 * x.
The amount earned from large stuffed animals is $12 * (x/2).

We can set up an equation to represent the total amount earned:

$10x = $120

Now, divide both sides by 10:

x = 12

Seats left for friends and family: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. Since the number of graduates is the same as the seats for graduates, we can use that number.

Number of graduates: 950
Seats for friends and family: 4750
Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans he can eat. 

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and he can eat 75 large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3 to find the number of small beans. 

So, 150 * 3 = 450.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to calculate her total pay and total expenses first.

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she spends a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Her total pay is $15 per day for 3 days, so she earns 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses are $3 per day for 3 days, so she spends 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her total pay to find her total pay after expenses: $45 - $9 = $36.

Finally, we can divide her total pay after expenses by the total number of hours she worked to find her hourly pay after expenses: $36 / 18 = $2.

"To find out how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find out how many bottles of soda he will have. 

Since Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide 24 by 3 to find the number of bottles. 

24 / 3 = 8 

So, there will be 8 bottles of soda. 

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles (minus 1, because he starts at the first bottle) by 5 seconds. 

7 * 5 = 35 

So, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To find out how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn.

The total amount of loans Jim took is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

The amount of money Jim lost from not working while in school is the amount he would have earned in 4 years at his previous job:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income, we divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric. 

The bed is 6 feet long, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer, so the fabric length is 6 + 2 = 8 feet.

The bed is 8 feet wide, and the fabric needs to be 2 feet wider, so the fabric width is 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to find the area of one piece and multiply it by 2. 

The area of one piece of fabric is the length times the width, so it's 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces, he needs 80 * 2 = 160 square feet of fabric.

"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than 85 is 85 + 17 = 102.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
5 more than 204 is 204 + 5 = 209.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day to find the total:
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

"To find the average amount lost, we need to find the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's find the total amount lost. 
Total amount lost = $5 (lost) - $11 (won) + $16.50 (lost) = $10.50.

Since he had 3 races, we divide the total amount lost by 3 to find the average amount lost.
Average amount lost = $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Let the share of the first person be x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine the x terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8 of a day each day, we multiply 21 days by 3/8:
21 days * 3/8 = 21 * 3 / 8 = 63 / 8 = 7.875 days.

Now, we convert 7.875 days to hours: 7.875 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4:
189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

"Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x. 

Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set, the number of balls in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls in the third set is x / 2.

We know that the total number of balls is 19. So we can write an equation: 
x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Now, we can subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Next, we can divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Since Paul arrives at the station when the first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes, we subtract 10 from the total time to get the waiting time. Paul will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she already has. 

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the price at which he bought the watch and compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll find the discount amount and divide it by the original price, then multiply by 100.

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by friend
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount amount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10%

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours and then multiply that by the number of springs.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in 1 hour. 
Since there are 4 hours, we multiply 3600 by 4 to get 3600 * 4 = 14400 seconds.

Now, since there are 5 springs, each creating 1 jellyfish per second, we multiply the total seconds by 5. 
So, 14400 * 5 = 72000 jellyfish.

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his speed.

First, James walked halfway to the store, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles. Then, he walked back home, which is another 2 miles. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance he walked is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, we can divide the total distance by his speed to find the total time: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then subtract the two amounts.

First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny bought. She bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, so she bought 10 x 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so 40 bananas would cost 40 x $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, so 10 bunches would cost 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, let's subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually to find out how much money Jenny saved: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"To find out how much fence Sam gets, we need to figure out how much Harry gets first. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, let's say Sam gets x feet. Then Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find out how many Trekking bikes were sold. Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so:
300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes

Next, let's find out how many BMX bikes were sold. 15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so:
15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes

Now, let's find out how many MTB bikes were sold. The rest of the bikes were MTB type, so:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes

The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, so:
Price of BMX = $500 / 2 = $250

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500
Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour. In 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour. In 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To find the extra learning time, we need to calculate 1/16 of his weekly minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends 1/16 of this time on extra learning, which is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes per week.

However, this is the total for both Saturday and Sunday, so we need to divide this by 2 to get the minutes per day for Saturday and Sunday. 630 / 2 = 315 minutes per day for Saturday and Sunday.

Now we add the minutes he spends in class and the minutes he spends on extra learning. 1600 + 630 = 2230 minutes per week.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 2230 / 60 = 37.17 hours.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag has 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Now, we know that the orchard sold 200 bags. Since each bag costs $5, we can multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total earnings.

200 bags × $5/bag = $1000

"To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, that means the Allosaurus ate half of what the velociraptors left. So, the velociraptors left 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what the T-Rex left, that means the T-Rex left 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the original weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to find the total area of the walls and then divide it by the area covered by one gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost is 12 x 12 = $144.

Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas. 

Out of the 8 remaining sodas, 2 are shaken and 6 are unshaken. 

The probability of choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas. 

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
Probability = 2 / 8
Probability = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100.

Probability percentage = 0.25 * 100
Probability percentage = 25%

"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to find the speed of the second train and then calculate the total distance they've traveled.

The second train is traveling half the speed of the first train, which is 60 miles per hour. So, the speed of the second train is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours. 

The first train has traveled 60 miles per hour * 3 hours = 180 miles.

The second train has traveled 30 miles per hour * 3 hours = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them.

So, the total distance is 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.

20% of 50 is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days. 

So, Billy works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age. Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Lauren needs to save for her retirement and then determine how many years it will take her to save that amount.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren needs to save for her retirement. She wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. So, she needs:

$100,000 x 0.40 = $40,000 per year

Since she wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years, she needs:

Now, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her annual salary, which is:

$100,000 x 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To find out how many years it will take Lauren to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year:

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we need to first find out how many toys the first 4 workers produce in total.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so 2 x 6 = 12 toys per hour.
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so 2 x 4 = 8 toys per hour.
So, the first 4 workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys they produce is 20 x 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys, but they still need 20 more after the first 4 workers finish their shift. This means the first 4 workers and the fifth worker together produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to find the weight of Elijah's dogs first. 

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog is 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs: 
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds
Total weight: 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

"To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards. 

Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. 

Since Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris. 

Luis used half of the stickers, so Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before using half of them.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to find out how many M&M's he has in total. 

He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight of M&M's is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

Now, John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 / 10 = 90

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half of the way around the earth, we need to first find out what half of the circumference of the earth is. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we know Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we need to divide 20,000 by 400.

20,000 / 400 = 50

"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first. 

The average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 
So, the speed of the fastest car is 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. 

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. So we can write an equation: 
x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. 

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. 
Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 
21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight, we need to find the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes. 

Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So the weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. We can do this by dividing the number of crayons by 8. 
200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes to get the total weight in ounces. 
200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the total weight in pounds. 
400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, we find out how much of the tree can be used to make logs: 
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Now, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price of each plank to find the total amount John makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's say her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that time = distance / speed. So, the time she spends on the beach is 2 miles / x miles per minute = 2/x minutes. We are given that this time is 40 minutes. So, 2/x = 40.

To find x, we can multiply both sides by x and then divide both sides by 40. This gives us x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time she spends on the sidewalk. The time is 1 mile / (2x miles per minute) = 1 / (2 * 1/20) = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the time she spends on the beach plus the time she spends on the sidewalk. This is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

$4 * 8 = $32

She has saved $32 so far. Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60.

$60 - $32 = $28

She needs to save $28 more. Since she saves $4 per week, we need to divide $28 by $4.

$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water into his bottle, the total temperature becomes at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / (4 + 1) = 40

Simplifying the equation:

(132 + x) / 5 = 40

Multiplying both sides by 5:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the second bottle is at least 68 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 21 days, they bring 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 21 days, they bring 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

The initial number of cows is 50, and the initial number of chickens is 20.

So, the total number of cows after 3 weeks is 50 + 420 = 470.
The total number of chickens after 3 weeks is 20 + 210 = 230.

The total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks is 470 + 230 = 700.

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to first find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount.

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

The 10% discount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.

So, the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 x 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, we can find the cost of each single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we need to subtract 5 from 23. 
23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops. 
3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Now, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop. 
18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans to find the total number of non-blue jellybeans.

Total non-blue jellybeans = 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51

Since there are 60 jellybeans in total, we subtract the total non-blue jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = 60 (total) - 51 (non-blue) = 9

We can do this by dividing the total number of passengers by the total number of parts in the ratio: 
84 / 14 = 6

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part (6) to find the number of women:
9 * 6 = 54

We also know that he earned $56 from the bouquets per day and each bouquet costs $8. So, the number of bouquets he sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets he sold per day is 7 * 12 = 84.

So, the total number of sunflowers he sold per day is 13 + 84 = 97.

Now, let's multiply this by 3 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in 3 days: 97 * 3 = 291.

He buys 20 rocks and sells them for $7 each, but only sells 60% of his inventory. To find out how many rocks he sells, we multiply 20 by 0.6 (which is the same as 60%):
20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

He sells 12 rocks for $7 each, so he makes:
12 * $7 = $84

He spent $100 to buy the rocks, but only made $84. To find out how much he loses, we subtract $84 from $100:

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to add the days for each type of scene. However, this would be incorrect as she can work on different scenes on different days. 

A better approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days for each type of scene or to find the most efficient way to complete the scenes.

However, a more straightforward approach is to calculate the total number of days by adding the days for each type of scene, but considering that she can work on different scenes on different days. 

9 days for large scenes, 6 days for medium scenes, and 7 days for small scenes. The most efficient way would be to work on large scenes for 9 days, and on the remaining days work on medium and small scenes.

On the 9 days she works on large scenes, she can also work on 9 * 6 = 54 medium scenes, but she only needs 36, so she can finish the medium scenes in 6 days. On the remaining 3 days of the 9 days, she can work on 3 * 7 = 21 small scenes. She still needs 49 - 21 = 28 small scenes. She can finish the remaining small scenes in 28 / 7 = 4 days.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of the first ticket winning by the probability of the second ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so it has a 3 x 20% = 60% chance of winning.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities together: 20% x 60% = 0.2 x 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 x 100 = 12%.

Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, so Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. 
Carrey collected half of what Carlos collected, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected: 
27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. 
The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 
To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (since 60% is the same as 0.6). 
60% of 5 minutes is 5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes.

Since the second song is 60% longer, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song. 
So, the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette. 
Total time = 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.

He sells each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

The total selling price is 6 x $40 = $240.

"To find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs. 

Since 1 bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy needs, we need to divide 100% by 20% to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs. 

100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

Now, we need to multiply the number of bottles needed per person by the number of people (2300) to find out the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of 2300 people's daily energy needs.

5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Now, we need to subtract the number of bottles the company can produce in a day (4200) from the total number of bottles needed (11500) to find out how many more bottles the company needs to produce.

11500 - 4200 = 7300.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
She dresses 3/4 of them in purple, which is 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies in purple.

All the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) also wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
There are 2 babies wearing purple bows out of 4 babies wearing bows. 
To find the percentage, we divide 2 by 4 and multiply by 100: (2/4) * 100 = 50%.

Then, he sold 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs that were found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total number of collections he makes.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which is 240. Then we add 240 to 400 to get 640 apartments in the last complex.

Now we have a total of 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so he makes 3 collections per week per apartment. He gets paid $.40 per collection per apartment.

To find the total amount of money he makes in a week, we multiply the total number of apartments (1040) by the number of collections per week (3) and by the amount he gets paid per collection ($.40).

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in 10 years, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree yet, so we'll come back to this later.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it's 0 fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now that we know a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the number of fruits produced each year:
- 5-year-old: 50
- 6-year-old: 150
- 7-year-old: 350
- 8-year-old: 800
- 9-year-old: 0
- 10-year-old: 1000
- We also need to add the number of fruits produced by the tree in its first 4 years. Since we don't have that information, we'll assume the tree didn't produce any fruits in its first 4 years (this is a reasonable assumption since the problem doesn't provide any information about the tree's production in its first 4 years).

However, the problem does state that a 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits, and a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits. This implies that the initial amount of fruits is the amount produced by a 5-year-old tree, which is 50 fruits. Therefore, we can assume that the tree produced 0 fruits in its first 4 years.

Total number of fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350"

"Let's break this down step by step.

Let the length of the yellow rope be y. 
The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope is y - 7.
The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Length of blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

They each gave an equal amount of money to their little sister. Let's call this amount x.

After giving x dollars to their sister, Ronnie has $5 - x dollars left. Rissa has $15 - x dollars left.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5 * ($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, we can subtract $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Dividing both sides by -5 gives us:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their sister.

Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

So, the amount of chalk left after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find 20% of the original 5 inches, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we need to find out how many 1-inch pieces are in 2.75 inches. 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 2 days.

However, we also need to consider that the teacher can't write with a very small piece of chalk and recycles it when it is smaller than 2 inches. After 2 days, the teacher will have 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches left. This is less than 1 inch, but the teacher can still use it for one more day, and then it will be smaller than 2 inches and he will have to recycle it.

So, the teacher has 2 days of using 1 inch of chalk and 1 more day of using the remaining 0.75 inches.

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

Now, let's find out the total number of books Bob can buy: 
54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books.

Since Bob is distributing the books between 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3:
5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree initially.
2. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket (1 apple in pocket) and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, there are 5 new apples on the ground and 1 in his pocket.
3. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket (5 + 1 = 6 apples in pocket) and threw the remaining one at the tree. 
4. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree. Now, there are 6 new apples on the ground and 6 in his pocket.
5. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples (6 new apples) and added them to the 6 apples in his pocket.

To find the total number of apples Newton brought home, we add the apples in his pocket to the new apples he picked up: 6 (in pocket) + 6 (new apples) = 12.

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags of coal he ordered. 

We can do this by dividing the total amount of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg). 

850 kg / 50 kg = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so in total, each friend eats 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since Kate has 6 friends, the total number of slices they will eat is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Now, let's calculate how many pizzas Kate needs to buy:

For cheese pizzas, each pizza has 12 slices. To find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs, we divide the total number of cheese slices needed (6 slices per friend * 6 friends = 36 slices) by the number of slices per pizza (12). 
36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

For pepperoni pizzas, each pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices needed (4 slices per friend * 6 friends = 24 slices) by the number of slices per pizza (8). 
24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

3 + 3 = 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran, we need to add the miles he ran each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. Since there are 3 days, we multiply 3 miles by 3 days:
3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. Since there are 2 days, we multiply 5 miles by 2 days:
5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the miles from both groups of days:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to calculate how many snowballs he makes per hour and subtract the ones that melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs in an hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 60 by 15 to get 4. This means 2 snowballs melt 4 times in an hour, so 2 x 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour.

Now, we subtract the melted snowballs from the ones Jay makes: 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by 12: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, before the second day, they had 103 + 28 = 131 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, before using those 38 bandages, they had 131 - 50 = 81 bandages.

In 4 weeks, she works 45 * 4 = 180 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from hours worked is 180 * 1.5 = $270.

Since she has complete attendance, she also receives an additional $10 * 4 = $40.

Total amount Jen will receive is $270 + $40 = $310.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the scotch per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

The cost of the cognac per bottle is 50% more than the scotch, so it is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 2 x 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the first day, the total number of trees planted is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is 10.

He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

On the second day, the total number of trees planted is 10 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 60 (second day) = 120 trees.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to first find the total height of the house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison is 60 inches tall. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

However, this is the height from the ground to the second floor's ceiling. Since we want the height from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor's ceiling, which is the same as the first floor's ceiling, 180 inches, from the total height of the house and then subtract the height of the first floor's ceiling from that result. But since the second floor's ceiling is the same height as the first floor's ceiling, we can just subtract the first floor's ceiling from the total height of the house and then subtract the first floor's ceiling again. 420 - 180 = 240, then 420 - 240 = 180.

Since there's a 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $75. 
20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost of the manicure and pedicure.
$75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to find the cost of the nail art. There are 10 fingers, and each nail costs $3.
10 * $3 = $30.

Now, add the cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art.
$60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the total number of magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The magazine that sends 6 issues a year will send 6 issues.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it will send 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the price of the toy after the 80% increase in December. 
   The price in November was $40. 
   To find the price in December, we need to calculate 80% of $40 and add it to $40.
   80% of $40 is 0.8 * $40 = $32.
   So, the price in December is $40 + $32 = $72.

2. Now, we need to find the price of the toy after the 50% decrease in January.
   The price in December was $72.
   To find the price in January, we need to calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from $72.
   50% of $72 is 0.5 * $72 = $36.
   So, the price in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he makes from the standard rate lessons and the amount he makes from the veteran lessons.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie charges $80 per hour. He has 4 1-hour lessons at this rate, so he makes:
4 x $80 = $320

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 x $80 = $20
Reduced rate = $80 - $20 = $60

Charlie has 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, so he makes:
2 x $60 = $120

Now, we add the amount he makes from the standard rate lessons and the amount he makes from the veteran lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that Michael has covered.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. The pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie, so she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Now, we need to add the grapes that Madeline ate, the grapes that her brother used, and the grapes that their mother used to find out how many grapes were there at the beginning.

6 (Madeline's grapes) + 30 (brother's grapes) + 48 (mother's grapes) = 84

The gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of cheddar cheese, so it's 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of the ingredients for one batch is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, he makes it 52 times a year (there are 52 weeks in a year).

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to first find the total time spent cleaning classrooms and then divide it by the total time available in a day.

The custodian has 80 classrooms to clean and it takes 15 minutes per classroom. 
Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since they have 5 days to get it done, we divide the total time by 5 days.
Time spent per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day

Now, we need to convert the time available in a day from hours to minutes. 
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

Now, we can find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms.
Percentage = (Time spent per day / Total time available in a day) * 100

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total amount she will make from selling them.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs. Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she bought 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's find the total amount she will make from selling the eggs. She will sell 3 eggs for $1, so she will make $1 for every 3 eggs. Since she has 60 eggs, she can make 60 / 3 = 20 sets of 3 eggs. So, she will make 20 x $1 = $20.

To find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total amount she will make: $20 - $12 = $8.

There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the bag has 232 pieces of candies in total, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies: 
232 - 189 = 43

"To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus rides separately, then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is 3 x $80 = $240.

The cost of one bus ride is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80. To find 10% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.1, which is $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus rides is 7 x $8 = $56.

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus rides to find the total cost of Helen's trip: $240 + $56 = $296.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 at the original price of $8 each. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, he pays full price for the first T-shirt ($8) and 50% off for the second T-shirt. 
50% of $8 is $8 * 0.5 = $4. 
So, the second T-shirt costs $8 - $4 = $4. 
The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and they are 40% off. 
40% of $40 is $40 * 0.4 = $16.

We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is 'w'. We are given that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation: 

c + w = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write another equation:

2c + 4w = 70

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' by first multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get:

2c + 4w - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30
w = 15

Now that we know 'w', we can substitute it back into the first equation to find 'c':

There are 4 people in total (Henry and 3 friends). To share the slices equally, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.
