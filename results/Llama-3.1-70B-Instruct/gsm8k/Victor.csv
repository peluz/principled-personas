"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7.

The number of eggs she sells is 16 - 7 = 9.

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes every day at the farmers' market is 9 * 2 = 18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, the $50,000 in repairs also contributed to the increased value. To find the selling price, we need to add the value added by the repairs to the original value of the house. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, the value added by the repairs is $50,000 * 1.5 = $75,000 (this is the increase in value, not the actual cost of repairs). The new value is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000, but this is not correct as the value added by the repairs is actually $75,000 more than the cost of repairs, so the correct new value is $80,000 + $50,000 + $75,000 = $205,000.

However, the problem states that the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

The correct new value is actually $200,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to find out the total amount of feed needed for the day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can pair the glasses as follows: 
- 1st and 2nd glass: $5 + $3 = $8
- 3rd and 4th glass: $5 + $3 = $8
- 5th and 6th glass: $5 + $3 = $8
- 7th and 8th glass: $5 + $3 = $8
- 9th and 10th glass: $5 + $3 = $8
- 11th and 12th glass: $5 + $3 = $8
- 13th and 14th glass: $5 + $3 = $8

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep:

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download 200 GB is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he was in standstill traffic, so he didn't move.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drove at 30 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drove at 80 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

However, we also need to consider the distance he traveled before turning around, which is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To calculate this, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree ($3 per year). 

The total revenue is the annual revenue from selling lemons, which is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

Let's calculate the total cost and total revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93, Total revenue = $10.5
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96, Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99, Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102, Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105, Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous total cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108, Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63

We can see that the total revenue is still less than the total cost in the first 5 years. However, in the 6th year, the total revenue ($63) is still less than the total cost ($108), but in the 7th year, the total revenue will be $10.5 * 7 = $73.5 and the total cost will be $108 + $3 = $111, and in the 8th year, the total revenue will be $10.5 * 8 = $84 and the total cost will be $111 + $3 = $114, and in the 9th year, the total revenue will be $10.5 * 9 = $94.5 and the total cost will be $114 + $3 = $117, and in the 10th year, the total revenue will be $10.5 * 10 = $105 and the total cost will be $117 + $3 = $120, and in the 11th year, the total revenue will be $10.5 * 11 = $115.5 and the total cost will be $120 + $3 = $123, and in the 12th year, the total revenue will be $10.5 * 12 = $126 and the total cost will be $123 + $3 = $126.

However, in the 12th year, the total revenue ($126) is equal to the total cost ($126), but in the 13th year, the total revenue will be $10.5 * 13 = $136.5 and the total cost will be $126 + $3 = $129.

So, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Since he made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend all the money he made from selling lego sets. The difference is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Distance without gemstone: 400 feet
Distance with gemstone: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, we subtract that from the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone to find the distance outside the flames she can stand and still hit the dragon.

Distance outside flames: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

"To find out how many grams you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left for the day. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for the day.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories.
200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 
Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find the total cost. For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles. Since he made 20 candles, he used 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so the cost of 2 pounds is:
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's find the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

The total number of articles she wrote in the three days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. So, the number of Post-it notes she had remaining is (80 + x) - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. So, we can set up the equation:

(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The answer is: 163"
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to first find out how many blue ties he bought and then how many red ties he bought.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight of toys to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."

The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
The 10% increase is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60.
So, her new monthly salary after the increase is $600 + $60 = $660.

Since this increase happens every year for the next three years, we need to calculate the increase for each year.

Year 1: $660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $660 + $66 = $726.
Year 2: $726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.
Year 3: $798.60 + 10% of $798.60 = $798.60 + 0.1 * $798.60 = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46.

Now, we multiply the final monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary.
Annual salary = $878.46 * 12 = $10,541.52.

"Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the number of guests that will actually show up. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of attendees as follows:

Number of invited guests: 16
Number of guests that don't show up: 16 * 1/4 = 4
Number of guests that will show up: 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed as follows:

Total gift bags needed: 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost: 9 * $2 = $18

"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each. There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, so they eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs each. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16 to get the number of cans: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to get the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12.

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. 
On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. 
On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using a variable to represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Let's call this number x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, the number of cookies he meant to bake this year is 2x.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

He then drops 5 cookies, so the total number of cookies he has left is (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are told that this number is equal to 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 50

So Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

x = 1280 / 16
x = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can find out how much water the boat took on. The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet.

The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides and multiply it by the cost per ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, they rode a total of 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 
So, his total mileage for Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

We are given that his total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. 
To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total mileage for Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday: 
41 - 28 = 13 miles.

"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to calculate the total number of car washes he gets in a year and multiply it by the cost of each car wash.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of car washes he gets in a year is:
4 car washes/month * 12 months/year = 48 car washes/year

The cost of each car wash is $15, so the total amount Tom pays in a year is:
48 car washes/year * $15/car wash = $720/year

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian had before he lost 5. Brian had 20 video games after losing 5, so he originally had 20 + 5 = 25 video games.

Now, we know Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. So, we multiply Brian's original number of video games by 3: 25 * 3 = 75.

Then, we subtract 5 from that result to find out how many video games Bobby has: 75 - 5 = 70.

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we find the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

27 * (1/3) = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

The cost of the subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of the chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of the cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
The total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

"To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test and subtract that from the total number of questions.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 
The number of questions he completed in the first test is 8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. 
The number of questions he completed in the second test is 6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions.

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

Substituting B = 2Q into W = 2B, we get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into Q + B + W = 700, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find W: W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400.

"To find the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the information given:

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. This is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that left the hive but hadn't returned yet. Initially, 30 bees left, and 15 returned, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees were still out. Then, 60 more bees left, so the total number of bees that left but hadn't returned is 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before but hadn't already returned come back to the hive. Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:
James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends

"To find out how long the winner will be waiting, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. The total number of fries eaten so far is 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
5. Let's say the original number of fries is x. After the seagull and pigeons ate, there were x - 30 fries left.
6. The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30).
7. The raccoon left 1/3 of the remaining fries, which is (1/3)(x - 30).

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut a potato, we need to add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to cut. 

Time to peel a potato: 1 minute 30 seconds = 1.5 minutes
Time to cut a potato: 5 seconds = 0.0833 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel and cut a potato: 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the total time per potato by 60:

Total time to peel and cut 60 potatoes: 1.5833 * 60 = 95 minutes

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards. 

First, let's find out the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2, so the total cost is $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can divide this by the profit per gallon to find out how many gallons they made: $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons.

Now, we know they made 5 gallons, and the cost of lemons per gallon is $3. So, the total cost of lemons is 5 * $3 = $15.

Zaid's salary is 6000$. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$

Total spent so far: 1500 + 2000 = 3500$

Remaining amount: 6000 - 3500 = 2500$

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$

Remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

Since Jan is 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Mark's current age would be 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age would be 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4x400 meter relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So, the times for each runner are:

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling an even number on the second roll. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Now, we need to find the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage. The difference in probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. This will give us the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats. 140 - 50 = 90.

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages of rats. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 6 * number of rats. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats is 3 * number of rats per cage.

We can set up the equation: 6 * 3 * number of rats per cage = 90.

Solving for the number of rats per cage, we get: 
6 * 3 * number of rats per cage = 90
18 * number of rats per cage = 90
number of rats per cage = 90 / 18
number of rats per cage = 5

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes. 

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.
So, the total amount she owes is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. 
Total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's calculate Janeth's remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she owes.
Janeth's remaining balance = $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to find the number of dahlias first. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we add 7 to the number of roses.

Number of roses = 4
Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can add these up to find out how many points they scored in total: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54.

Initially, 30% of 120 melons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons.

So, Ashlyn took 36 melons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. 
3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 melons.

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Ram starts with 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he can make new pens from the empty ones. Since it takes 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen, we can divide the initial 25 pens by 5 to find out how many new pens he can make from the first set of empty pens.

25 / 5 = 5

So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the initial 25 empty pens. Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

However, the 5 new pens will also run out of ink eventually, and Ram can make more pens from those empty ones. Since it takes 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen, he can make 1 more pen from the 5 empty pens.

Now, Ram has 30 (previous pens) + 1 (new pen) = 31 pens.

The 1 new pen will also run out of ink, but Ram won't have enough empty pens to make another full pen (he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen). So, the process stops here.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages exchanged per week is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 60 pages per week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page, so the total time he spends writing per week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500
Total price of the house: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:

"To heat the oil to 300 degrees, it takes 20 minutes. To heat it to 400 degrees, it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. 
It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of them are his lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are his lines, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, we add the lines for the song, the first scene, and the second scene to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, substitute the first equation into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expand the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them up as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 2 = 16 pieces of paper

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a straightforward manner. But in this case, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, and the last page is on the right back. This means that the pages are paired in a way that the first and last pages are on the same piece of paper, the second and second-to-last pages are on the same piece of paper, and so on.

To accommodate this arrangement, we need to consider that the first and last pages are on the same piece of paper, which means that we need one more piece of paper to accommodate the remaining pages.

So, the correct calculation is:

16 pieces of paper (for the paired pages) + 1 piece of paper (for the first and last pages) is not correct, but rather just 16 pieces of paper for 32 pages.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

For the ice cream, the original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we are buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses first.

6 business suits at $100 each will cost 6 * $100 = $600.
3 suitcases at $50 each will cost 3 * $50 = $150.
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500.
So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.
Total expenses so far are $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.
He also wants to save $2000 for the trip.

Total money set aside for the trip is $1950 (expenses) + $2000 (savings) = $3950.
He has $6000 for the trip, so he has $6000 - $3950 = $2050 left to spend on gifts.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed per day and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
The rest of the family (5 - 3 = 2 people) eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.
Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We also know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Finally, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of players on each team. 

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. 
Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. 
There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

The total number of players is 105, so we can set up the equation:
D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(2D + D) + D/2 = 105
3D + D/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
6D + D = 210
7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (pole) / 3 (wires) = x (poles) / 45 (wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

1/4 of the total number of people left, so the number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many pencils Jam has in boxes, we subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total number of pencils she has. 
26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in boxes.

Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, we divide the total number of pencils in boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold.
24 (pencils in boxes) / 3 (boxes) = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have to find out the total number of pencils they have together.
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

To find out how many boxes they need, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold.

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month. The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since it takes 3 minutes to charge 1 percentage point, it will take 40 * 3 minutes to charge 40 percentage points.

Adding this to her initial savings of $80, Annabelle now has 275 + 80 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, Annabelle still needs to save 400 - 355 = $45.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the height of the second tree: 
   Height of the shortest tree = 6 feet
   Height of the second tree = Height of the shortest tree + 5 feet
   Height of the second tree = 6 + 5 = 11 feet

2. Find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
   Combined height = Height of the shortest tree + Height of the second tree
   Combined height = 6 + 11 = 17 feet

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the toys and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had, then add the extra money his mother gave him.

The cost of 6 toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The cost of 5 teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $.05 each. So, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * .05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, the total change he had must have been 2 * 2 = $4.

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is 10 - 4 = $6.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is 6 / 1.5 = 4.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one day, we need to calculate the distance of the entire trip. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles. 
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 
The combined distance of the first two legs is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles. 

The total distance of the trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. 
Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles. 

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total miles the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total miles traveled in a day (900 miles).

The interest can be calculated as follows:
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Interest = $3,650 * 10% * (5/12) 
Since the time is given in months, we need to convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate by dividing by 12.
Interest = $3,650 * (10/100) * (5/12)
Interest = $3,650 * 0.1 * (5/12)
Interest = $3,650 * 0.04167

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $152.04
Total Amount = $3,802.04

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. The energy used in a day will be 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours (Wh) or 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

The energy saved in a day is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh.

To find the energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved in a day by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh.

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to find the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so they have 2 * 17 = 34 stripes in total.
One zebra has 36 stripes.
Another zebra has half of 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 4.

The average number of stripes is 88 / 4 = 22.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required and then multiply by the cost per pound.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, Tyson will need to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so for 5 sandwiches, he will need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis, then add the ones he bought.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

The total number of corns is 80 + 20 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he took before the jog and subtract that from the total steps he needed to take.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before the jog, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before the jog, he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps taken.

Now, we subtract the steps taken before the jog from the total steps taken before the jog and after the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000.

"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read the book and then subtract that from the total time he has before leaving for the airport.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. So, the total number of words in the book is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find the time it takes him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby needs is:
30 minutes (to read the book) + 10 minutes (to get to the airport) = 40 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the total time he needs from the time he has:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30.
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600.
The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract it from the $10 her parents gave her.

The taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of Sally's purchases is $4.5 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally had $10 initially, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework.

The first package costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, add the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. 

Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events.

First, let's find the number of candles that will explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% will explode. 
1% of 50000 candles is 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles.

Next, let's find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. 5% of the candles have this defect.
5% of 50000 candles is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles.

However, we are interested in the intersection of the two events, i.e., the candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the two events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of the two events.

The probability of a candle exploding is 0.01, and the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 0.05. The probability of both events occurring is 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005.

Now, we can multiply this probability by the total number of candles to find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode:
0.0005 * 50000 = 25

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

So, the discount per blouse is $6. 
The discounted price per blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half as many apples from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350.

However, this is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. Since Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is all gathered by Joanne.

The answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write the equation: 
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting c into the first equation:
c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given:

1. Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km
2. Distance traveled over the next 2 days: 30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km
3. Distance traveled on the 7th day: 0 km (he wasn't traveling)
4. Distance traveled in the second week: 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances: 
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to find Zack's locker size.

Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

Now, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. 

Oliver's current elevation: 3,000 feet
Elevation of the comb: 6,000 feet

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $12000 + $5000 = $17000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since Bill is signing up for 2 years (24 months), we need to subtract the introductory period and the increased rate period from the total months to find the number of months at the normal rate. 
However, since the introductory period is 6 months and the increased rate period is the remaining months after the normal rate period, we can calculate the normal rate period as follows:
2 years = 24 months
Introductory period = 6 months
Increased rate period = 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months is incorrect, so we use 24 - 6 = 18 months remaining, 8 months at normal rate, and 10 months at increased rate is incorrect, so we use 18 - 8 = 10 months is incorrect, so we use 24 -

"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Since the jogger jeans cost $22 and he saved $2, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.

Since the tattered jeans cost $28 and he saved $4, the original price of the tattered jeans was $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

She bought 3 store-bought bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Now, we add the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 90 + 60 = 150.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item. 

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 25% of $4 is 0.25 * $4 = $1. So the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of all items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he made from selling his cards. Since he spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, he must have made $150.

We know that he sold his cards for $1.5 each, so we can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he sold:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, this is the number of cards he sold, not the number he started with. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 100, so we can solve for x:

2/3x = 100
x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To determine the number of hotdogs prepared, we first need to find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, that's 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

For 18 guests to have two hotdogs, the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs. The remaining 18 guests were expected to have one hotdog each, so the caterer prepared 18 * 1 = 18 hotdogs for them.

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

When 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed would be 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, there's a shortage of 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest needs one hotdog to have a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the shortage of hotdogs, which is 26."
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. Indras has 6 letters in her name, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so 3 + 4 = 7.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13.

The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

The total cost after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to first find out how many gallons were in each container. 

15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so she needed 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we multiply 3/4 by 8 to get the number of pints: 
3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to first determine how much money he spent on chips and how much he had left to spend on candy bars.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he had $0.05 left. This means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, we subtract the money spent on chips from the total money spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75. This is the amount he spent on candy bars.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we can divide the money spent on candy bars by the cost of a candy bar to find out how many he bought: $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake. 

First, we need to find the weight of one piece of cake. Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we divide the total weight by 8:
20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces in total. The weight of the two pieces eaten is:
2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the two pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake:
20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 
Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Since they will be sharing the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8 people.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges everyone will get.
Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add the 5 minutes she wants to arrive before Wayne.

It takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater. Since it takes Bernadette four times as long as Wayne, we multiply Wayne's time by 4:
4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes

Now, we add the 5 minutes Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne:
16 minutes + 5 minutes = 21 minutes

So Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards). First, we convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = length * width. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: width = Area / length. Plugging in the values, we get width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width). Plugging in the values, we get Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. So, she bought 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 * 20 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. So, she bought 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has 7 * 20 = 140 beads.

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. The difference is 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's:
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' bike ride time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's:
- James' bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:
- James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' run time:
- James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike ride time
- James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
- James' run time = 59 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the total amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours at 32MPH:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 32MPH x 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Total cost = Total hay x Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails x $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total money = 6 x $5
Total money = $30

Now, we can calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and the number of baseball cards separately and then add them together.

Number of basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards
Number of baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards
Total number of cards: 150 cards + 200 cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, so the remaining cards are given to her students:
350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

Since each student gets 10 cards, we can divide the total number of cards given to students by 10 to find the number of students:
300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost for each of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9. She received a $1 discount, so she paid $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10. She received a 10% discount, which is 0.1 * $10 = $1. So, she paid $10 - $1 = $9.

The difference in the amount Kelly paid and Becky paid is $9 - $8 = $1.

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair of shoes has 2 shoes, we'll multiply the number of pairs by 2.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add the shoes he got:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, so we subtract 180 from 300:

Number of kids allergic to both = 3

Since the kids allergic to both are counted twice, we need to subtract them once to avoid double counting.

Total number of kids allergic to at least one thing = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, subtract the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to calculate the increased price:
20% of $1500 = 0.20 * $1500 = $300
So, the increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Total cost: 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags. Each bag costs $4, so the total cost is 40 bags * $4/bag = $160.

Total revenue: 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost: $320 - $160 = $160.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * Suzanne's cookies
Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to calculate the total value of the $10 and $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40.
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.

The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80. So, Ali is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner, which is 3/5 * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find out how many minutes Royce takes, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes Rob to shingle a house. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. Double Rob's time is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes. Adding 40 minutes to this gives us Royce's time.

240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

- A scarf requires 4 skeins, so 3 scarves will require 4 * 3 = 12 skeins.
- A sweater requires 12 skeins, so 3 sweaters will require 12 * 3 = 36 skeins.
- A pair of mittens requires 1 skein, so 3 pairs will require 1 * 3 = 3 skeins.
- A pair of socks requires 2 skeins, so 3 pairs will require 2 * 3 = 6 skeins.

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

The remaining number of problems after Tuesday is 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

The total number of problems completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to find out how many cups of raisins she will use for the cookies. 

Since she is dividing the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, she will use 1/3 of the raisins for the cookies. 

1/3 of 27 cups is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. 

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we can divide 9 by 3/4 to find the number of batches.

9 / (3/4) = 9 * 4 / 3 = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts/hour
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts/hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh):
Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:
Weekly cost before: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly cost after: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:
$3528 - $3024 = $504

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it takes for one person to paint half a house:

5 days * 24 hours/day = 120 hours

Since one person can paint half a house in 120 hours, it would take one person 240 hours to paint a whole house (twice the time).

Now, if we have 5 people painting the house, we can divide the total time by 5 to find the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first find the number of chairs each person has. 

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs each person has:
Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

So, the total hours spent in those 5 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

For the 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, the total hours spent is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

For the week where he spent 6 hours, the total hours spent is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer than that is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 2 * 30 = 60 years. So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.

4. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We also know the cost of the computer and the printer. So, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)
= $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
= $2,400 - $1,800

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + (4 * 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 seashells in total.

"To find out how much James spends on candles, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

So James needs 4 packs of candles. The total cost will be the number of packs multiplied by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find the nephew's age, we need to first determine Shiloh's age in 7 years. Since Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

We are told that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's call the nephew's age in 7 years 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3x.

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 51 / 3 = 17.

Since 'x' represents the nephew's age in 7 years, to find his current age, we subtract 7 from 'x': 17 - 7 = 10.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per month and subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month.

The total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Ford grows 40 roses per week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, let's subtract the total number of roses Ford grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

The total cost is:
$3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature: 450
Actual temperature: 468
Difference: 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set her oven to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees, given that it's off by 4%.

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know that the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520

To find 4% of x, multiply x by 0.04:
x + 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:
1.04x = 520

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 boxes of contacts with a 10% discount:
Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.1 * $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
Cost of 2 boxes = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Since each box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each pair of contacts:

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories doing aerobics.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories running.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

1600 / 200 = 8.

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since we want to find out how many years the tire will last, we need to multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the rotations per year:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the rotations per year:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can find the total number of pumps by multiplying the number of washings by the number of pumps per washing and then dividing by the number of washings per 2 pumps.

Total number of pumps = 120 washings * 2 pumps / 120 washings * 1 pump = 240 pumps / 120 = 2 * 120 = 240 pumps / 2 = 120 * 2 = 240 / 2 = 120 * 2 = 240 / 2 = 120 * 2 = 240 / 2 = 240 / 2 = 120 * 2 = 240

The original price of the outfit is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60.

The 30% discount is 30% of $60, which is 0.3 * $60 = $18.

The discounted price is $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, the total cost is still $42.

Joe had $50 initially, so he will have $50 - $42 = $8 left after the purchase.

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. The initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. The cost per month for the remaining months is $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $30,000.

The cost for the remaining months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't consume any meat.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

He started with 20 pieces of gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Therefore, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount each coach spent.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two amounts. The difference is $112 - $27 = $85.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb. So, we can convert 20 kb to Mb by dividing by 1000:
20 kb / 1000 = 0.02 Mb per second

Next, we need to convert seconds to hours. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply 0.02 Mb per second by 3600:
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day, so the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

In the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to convert the required height from feet to inches and then subtract Adam's current height from it. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height of 4 feet is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 
48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to divide the remaining inches by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take him to reach the required height:
8 / 2 = 4 years.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find 10% of that profit.

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars, so the cost price of each car is 30% of $25,000, which is:
$25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500

The profit from each car is the selling price minus the cost price:
$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is:
$17,500 * 10 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his earnings are:
$175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to find the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25.

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 * 0.6 = 15

So, 15 women can stay upright. Now, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men.

25 - 15 = 10

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels.

The price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel, so:
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

The price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel, so:
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels:
Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover the 75-mile gap between them.

First, we need to find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed:
Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend while keeping the cost per class below $10. 

The total cost of the classes is $60. If Manny attends x classes, the cost per class will be 60/x. We want this to be less than or equal to $10.

60/x ≤ 10

To find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend, we can multiply both sides by x and then divide both sides by 10.

60 ≤ 10x
x ≥ 60/10
x ≥ 6

So, Manny can attend at most 6 classes while keeping the cost per class below $10. Since there are 10 total classes, he can miss at most 10 - 6 = 4 classes.

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

The total number of customers they process daily is 50 + 100 = 150.

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050.

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
The towing package is not given a price, so we will assume it is $0 for this calculation.
The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

We know that her first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days plus the next 3 days is 12 (initial good days) + 2 (additional good days) = 14.

However, we are asked about the good days left in the month after the first 30 days. Since we already know the total good days in the first 30 days (12), we subtract the good days in the first 30 days from the total good days including the next 3 days. But we actually need to subtract the good days in the first 30 days from the good days in the first 30 days plus the next 3 days, then subtract the good days in the first 30 days from that result. 

12 (initial good days) + 2 (additional good days) = 14. 
14 - 12 = 2.

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. 

Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write an equation:

2x = 21 - 3 
2x = 18 
x = 18 / 2 
x = 9

"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to convert the current height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the desired height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"To find the total number of toys James needs, we need to calculate the number of dogs he has to provide toys for.

Initially, James had 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means the number of dogs doubled. So, the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.

However, 3 dogs were gone when James came back again, so we subtract 3 from the total number of dogs: 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs a total of 21 toys.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to first find out how much Dylan and Frances invested.

Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

This remaining amount is Skyler's investment.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they already have. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44. So together, they have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

The sisters want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. To find out how many signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal.

100 (goal) - 64 (current signatures) = 36

So the sisters need to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal.

"To find out how much Karen earns, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours in two days.

Now, we multiply Karen's hourly wage by the number of hours she works in two days to find her total earnings: $20 * 6 = $120.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

Katarina has 68 cookies. 
Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can add up the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298 cookies.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x. 

She then adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20. 

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation: 
1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides: 
1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5: 
x = 80

The original length of the dress is 80cm."
"To find the time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time for each mode and add them together.

In turtle mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in turtle mode, it took him half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

In rabbit mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in rabbit mode, it took him half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation: T = t + 7.

We know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44. Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get: 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin using the first equation: T = t + 7. Substituting t = 6, we get: T = 6 + 7 = 13.

The total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20. 
The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 
So, the cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 
The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. 
The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved in 10 years, we first need to calculate how many coins each of them saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to find 2/5 of 20 and add it to 20.
2/5 * 20 = 8
So Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, we need to find out how many coins they save in a year. 
There are 12 months in a year.
Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we first need to calculate the total bill. 

The dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

The total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to first calculate the total number of boxes she bought this week. 

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. 
Total boxes this week = 3 + 5 = 8

Last week, Castle bought 4 boxes of cereal.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for both feet when Helga's arms are raised and when they are not.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, her right foot taps 300 times per minute, and her left foot taps 250 times per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps with arms at her sides is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When Helga raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, the total taps with arms raised is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

Now, we add the total taps with arms at her sides and with arms raised to get the combined total number of taps: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of not fixing it.

The cost of not fixing the pothole is $450 (the damage to Ron's car).

The cost of fixing the pothole includes:
- The fine from the city council: $120
- The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75

Total cost of fixing the pothole: $120 + $75 = $195

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole:

"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the slices eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

There are 5 pizzas in total, each with 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 * (2/3) * 12 = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42.

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18.

"To find the average time, we first need to find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. Since the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes, we multiply the cat's time by 2/3.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages. 
The dog takes 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes to eat the sausages.

Now, we find the average time by adding the time taken by the cat and the dog, then dividing by 2.

Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe 'x'. 

We can write an equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, by 16:00, a total of 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000 people had voted.

Total s'mores needed: 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores

Since each sleeve makes 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She still has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She still has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the rest of her large stickers.

Since a large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 9 large buttons are worth 9 * 3 = 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Ezra read 300 books in the first hour and 150 more, so Ezra read 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in the first hour, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

The total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 450 + 150 = 600.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she doesn't earn the additional $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 + $30 = $110.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold. 
20 (vanilla scents) - 16 (fruity scents) = 4

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 * 3 = $60 from the eggplants.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from the eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. This will give us the amount he needs to make from selling the corn.

$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we know that Bennet needs to make $75 from selling 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we can divide the amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn.

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to first find the total time she has available and then subtract the time spent reading and playing video games.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time remaining after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Time remaining after reading - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent playing soccer:
Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of movie separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these movies is 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie
The total cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $1.67 = $334

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which is:
400 * 0.4 = 160 movies

The cost of these older movies is $5 each, so the total cost is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are normal movies, which is:
400 - 160 = 240 movies

The cost of these normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost is:
240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing the movies is the sum of the costs of each type of movie:
$334 + $800 + $2400 = $3534

"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked.

First, let's find the distance driven. We know they drove for 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours. 

Distance driven = Speed * Time 
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours 
Distance driven = 225 miles

Now, let's find the distance hiked. We know they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed = 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour
Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour

Distance hiked = Speed * Time 
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours 
Distance hiked = 30 miles

Total distance to the vacation spot = Distance driven + Distance hiked 
Total distance to the vacation spot = 225 miles + 30 miles 
Total distance to the vacation spot = 255 miles

"To find the difference between their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them scored and then find the difference.

Let's assume Emma jumps on 'x' enemies and collects 'y' berries. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava jumps on 'x + 8' enemies. Also, Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects 'y + 3' berries.

Points for enemies: 
Emma: 10x
Ava: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80

Points for berries:
Emma: 5y
Ava: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15

Points for time:
Let's assume Emma finishes the level in 't' seconds. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, Ava finishes the level in 't - 4' seconds. 
Emma: 30t
Ava: 30(t - 4) = 30t - 120

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars, but since it is stated that two pizzas cost 30 dollars, we can assume that the two pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. 

So, the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 30 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all four pizzas: 
64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

On the usual 5 days, they ride thrice a day, so the total number of rides is 5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual times, which is 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day. So, the total number of rides on these 2 days is 2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides.

The total number of rides in a week is 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish he bought is 2x - 3 (since he already had 3 orange fish).

We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so the number of orange fish he bought plus the number of white fish he bought is 17. 

2x - 3 + x = 17

Combine like terms:
3x - 3 = 17

Add 3 to both sides:
3x = 20

Divide by 3:
x = 20/3
x = 6.67

Since you can't buy a fraction of a fish, we'll round down to 6 (as you can't buy 0.67 of a fish, but you can buy 1 more orange fish to make the ratio work). However, this is the number of white fish. The question asks for the number of white fish, so we'll stick with 6.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and the total amount of gas he uses.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.

In a week, Andy drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all of her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:

(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7:

Dale has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number sold from the total number of candies: 200 - 150 = 50.

"To find the number of additional students, we first need to find the total number of students at the end of May. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:
- Beginning of the year (January): 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:
320 (total students) - 10 (initial students) = 310

"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total branches climbed = Total amount made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total branches climbed by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches climbed per day = Total branches climbed / 7
Average branches climbed per day = 420 / 7
Average branches climbed per day = 60

"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then subtract the petals of the dropped flowers.

1. 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
2. 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
3. 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
4. 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals initially: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, we need to subtract the petals of the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, subtract the dropped petals from the total petals initially: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag. 
Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have.
S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of zest as 'x'. Then the amount of fragrance is also 'x'. The amount of salt is 2x, and the amount of sugar is also 2x. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so it's 2 * 2x = 4x.

Now, the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10

Combine like terms:
x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10
10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
x = 1

Now that we know x is 1, we can find the amount of oil:
Oil = 4x
Oil = 4 * 1
Oil = 4

"To find out how many cars Joe has initially, we need to know that he has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Now, let's calculate the number of cars Joe has left. He initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, the number of cars he has left is 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, the amount he earns per cycle is:
5 tasks * $1.20 per task = $6 per cycle

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are:
$6 per cycle * 30 cycles = $180 per day

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
$180 per day * 7 days = $1260

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341. So, we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 * 20 = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

900 / 60 = 15 hours

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the question states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, which means they will build 96 homes in the third year, not that the total will be 96. The correct total is 12 + 36 + 96.

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87

Combine like terms:
5x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:
5x = 78

Divide by 5:
x = 15.6

Since age is typically a whole number, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can't have a fraction of a year, so we'll look for whole number solutions. Let's try x = 15 and x = 16.

If x = 15, then the brother is 18, the sister is 13, and the mom is 53. The sum is 15 + 18 + 13 + 53 = 99, which is too high.

If x = 16, then the brother is 19, the sister is 14, and the mom is 56. The sum is 16 + 19 + 14 + 56 = 105, which is also too high.

If x = 14, then the brother is 17, the sister is 12, and the mom is 50. The sum is 14 + 17 + 12 + 50 = 93, which is still too high.

If x = 13, then the brother is 16, the sister is 11, and the mom is 47. The sum is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87, which is correct.

The answer is: 13"
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to find out the total number of glue sticks required. 

There are 27 students, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. 
Total glue sticks required = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 and round up to the nearest whole number (since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs).

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs
Rounded up to the nearest whole number, Mr. Jackson needs 7 packs.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's compare the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year. Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges. To find the difference, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins.

Total number of coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total number of coins = 70 + 40
Total number of coins = 110

We know that S = A + 25 and A = F - 12. We also know that S + A + F = 85.

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for F. 

Since A = F - 12, we can substitute A in the first equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25, which simplifies to S = F + 13.

Now, we can substitute S and A in the third equation: (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84.

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material needed for the small masks and the large masks separately.

For the small masks, Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To make 20 small masks, she will need:
20 / 4 = 5 times the material needed for 4 small masks
Since 4 small masks require 2 yards, 20 small masks will require:
5 * 2 = 10 yards

For the large masks, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To make 8 large masks, she will need:
8 / 3 = 2.67 times the material needed for 3 large masks
Since 3 large masks require 2.25 yards, 8 large masks will require:
2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
10 + 6 = 16 yards

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Adam's current age be x.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was 60 - 8 = 52.
Four years ago, Adam's age was x - 4.

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

52 = 2(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2x - 8
2x = 60
x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

He saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, which cost $10 each, so 5 x $10 = $50.
He saw 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each, so 8 x $7 = $56.
He had 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost $8 each, so 2 x $8 = $16.
He had 4 boxes of candy, which cost $2 each, so 4 x $2 = $8.

Total money spent so far is $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

He has $150 for the month, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since he wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy that night, which cost $8 + $2 = $10, he will have $20 - $10 = $10 left for the movie ticket.

Since it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10, which is exactly what he has left. So, he can see 1 more movie.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as L, and John's age as J.

We know that P = L + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)
We also know that L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
And the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so P + L + J = 100

Substituting L = J + 10 into P = L + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and L = J + 10 into P + L + J = 100, we get
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find L:
L = J + 10
L = 20 + 10

"To find Leo's age, we need to first find Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, Leo's age is 2 times Marcus' age. Leo's age is 2 * 21 = 42.

"Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + D = 45.

Also, since B = D + 10, we can substitute D in the equation A + (A + 20) + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + (B - 10) = 45.

But we know B = A + 20, so we can substitute B in the equation A + (A + 20) + (B - 10) = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + (A + 20 - 10) = 45.

This simplifies to A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45.

Combine like terms to get 3A + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 3A = 15.

Divide both sides by 3 to get A = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to first find the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per paper. Given that there are 100 papers (or pages) to the inch, the total number of pages per inch is 100 * 2 = 200 pages per inch.

Now, we multiply the total number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches:
200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are there from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. 

First, let's find the total hours: 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes: 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes by 15 minutes to find the number of 15-minute intervals: 900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval: 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

"To find the total minutes Kim slept, we first need to find the total minutes she would have slept if she hadn't woken up early and hadn't sleepwalked. 

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we subtract those 5 minutes: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She also woke up and sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. We subtract those 23 minutes from the total: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept 452 minutes on her bed that day.

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has 2 dozen cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups. 

So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the number of measuring cups and the number of measuring spoons. 
Total utensils = 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first calculate the initial number of occupied and unoccupied beds. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 
Number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds
Number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, the total number of occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds
The total number of unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Now, we can add up the number of balls each boy carried to find the total number of balls: 
Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

Total number of balls: 7"
"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the third day, and the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

The total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day to find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11.

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can set up the equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

Stan's Pokémon: 147"

Distance traveled north in the second leg = speed * time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Distance traveled south in the third leg = speed * time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled north in the second leg, we subtract this distance from the total distance traveled south:
Net distance = Distance traveled south in the first leg + Distance traveled south in the third leg - Distance traveled north in the second leg
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we can calculate the total age of all three family members:

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first find out how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the number of oranges she gave away and kept.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box contains 20 oranges, so she had 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

From point 3, we know that when Emil is 24, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12.

Since Emil is 19 now, 5 years will pass before he turns 24. So, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7.

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken up by each plant and the space between is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space taken up by each plant and the space between.

1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants (because we can't have a partial plant, and we already have 17 plants, so we will round down to 44 to avoid having to buy more plants than needed).

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

First, let's calculate the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many groups of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp, then multiply that by the time it takes her to sauté one group.

90 / 30 = 3

Since it takes her 10 minutes to sauté one group of 30 shrimp, it will take her 3 * 10 = 30 minutes to sauté 90 shrimp.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it goes to Greece for 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

Since the flights to France and Germany are equal, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11 flights.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to first find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. 

The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children: 
Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. 
Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

We know the ages of Akbar (3 years old) and Alessandro (4 years old). We also know Helene's age (10 years old). We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of the other three children from the total age:
Wilfred's age = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The neighbors donated $500, and the online fund collected $1500. The total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend also donated $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match, as Walter will tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200.

The lawyer will donate three times as much as the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is $2000. Three times this amount is 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine the total number of slices and the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults. There are 4 kids and 2 adults, so the total number of slices is 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

The number of slices each adult gets is 2x. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100
= (1/4) * 100

"To find the total time spent on rounds, we multiply the time per inpatient (20 minutes) by the number of inpatients (9). 
9 * 20 = 180 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
180 / 60 = 3 hours

To find the total time spent on appointments, we multiply the time per appointment (30 minutes) by the number of appointments (10).
10 * 30 = 300 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
300 / 60 = 5 hours

Now, we add the time spent at the clinic (9 hours), the time spent on rounds (3 hours), and the time spent on appointments (5 hours) to find the total time spent.
However, the time spent at the clinic is the total time available, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the time spent at the clinic.
9 - 3 - 5 = 1

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake and then subtract that from the serving time.

The total time required to make the cake is:
- 20 minutes to make the cake batter
- 30 minutes to bake the cake
- 2 hours (120 minutes) to cool the cake
- 10 minutes to frost the cake

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so he has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so she has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to subtract the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box.

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Total population = 50
Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born per female porcupine in a year is 4 * 12 = 48.

Total babies born in a year = 30 * 48 = 1440

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the babies born in a year.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we need to calculate the total gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

First, we know that the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, the total percentage lost in those 3 hours is 7% * 3 = 21%. 

Since the charge remaining was 28%, the charge before those 3 hours was 28% + 21% = 49%.

Now, we know that the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours. So, the total percentage lost in those 5 hours is 9% * 5 = 45%. 

Since the charge before those 5 hours was 49%, the initial charge of the power bank was 49% + 45% = 94%.

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total hourly income, which is the sum of her wages and tips.
$10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, her weekly income is:
$25 per hour * 40 hours per week = $1,000 per week.

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment:
$2,000 (down payment) / $1,000 (weekly income) = 2 weeks.

First, let's find the number of easy questions. 40% of 60 questions are easy.
40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we subtract the number of easy questions from the total number of questions to find the number of average and difficult questions.
60 - 24 = 36 questions.

Since these 36 questions are equally divided, we divide by 2 to find the number of average and difficult questions.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since a small stuffed animal costs $4, a large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is $4 * S, and the total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is $12 * L. The total earnings is $120, so we can write the equation:

$4 * S + $12 * L = $120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

$4 * 2L + $12 * L = $120
$8L + $12L = $120
$20L = $120

There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%.

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

"To find the total number of bottles, we need to divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle. 

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and the distance between each bottle is 3 feet. 

24 / 3 = 8 

So, there will be 8 bottles of soda. 

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to move to 7 more bottles. 

It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. 

7 * 5 = 35 

So, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn, we need to calculate the total amount of loans and the total amount of lost income.

Total amount of loans: 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000
Total amount of lost income: 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000
Total amount Jim needs to earn: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is 3 * $25,000/year = $75,000/year.

To calculate the time it would take Jim to earn the total amount, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the length of the fabric piece will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet.
The width of the fabric piece will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

The area of one fabric piece is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total square feet of fabric he needs is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Total amount lost = $5 (lost) - $11 (won) + $16.50 (lost) = $10.50.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so the sum of the shares of the three people is equal to $1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Since the team worked 3/8 of a day each day, the total hours worked by the team in 21 days is:
21 days * (3/8) * 24 hours/day = 21 * 3 * 3 = 189 hours.

Now, divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters:

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

Combine like terms:
2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:
60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds/hour
3600 seconds/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, and there are 5 springs:
14400 seconds * 5 jellyfish/second = 72000 jellyfish

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

James walked halfway to the store, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles. Then, he walked back home, which is another 2 miles. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store. So, the total distance he walked is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, the total time it took him to reach the store is 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

"To find the amount of money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then find the difference.

Jenny bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, so she bought 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying the bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.

The cost of buying the bananas in bunches is 10 * $3.00 = $30.

The amount of money Jenny saved is $32 - $30 = $2.

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine the growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. 
So, the growth rate per year is 8 / 4 = 2 inches per year.

Now, we can multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.
Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the difference between the number of bales the farmer makes and the number of bales the truck picks up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, we need to add the class time and the extra learning time. However, we can calculate the extra learning time as a fraction of the total weekly minutes, which includes both class time and extra learning time. Let's call the total weekly minutes 'x'. Then, the extra learning time is (1/16)x.

We know that the class time is 1600 minutes, and the extra learning time is (1/16)x. The total weekly minutes 'x' is the sum of class time and extra learning time:

x = 1600 + (1/16)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 16:

16x = 25600 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

15x = 25600

Divide both sides by 15:

x = 25600 / 15
x = 1706.67

Now, we can convert the total weekly minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

Total hours per week = 1706.67 / 60
Total hours per week = 28.44

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to first determine the number of bags sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag

"To find the initial weight of the triceratops, we need to work backwards. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, the initial weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

Now, the probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas.

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of remaining sodas

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until April 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he takes off is 20% of 50, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

The number of days Billy works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people Billy helps is 6 people per day * 40 days = 240 people.

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how long it will take her to reach that goal.

Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000, and she wants to live on 40% of that during retirement, which is $40,000 per year. Since she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, her total retirement savings goal is:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, which is equivalent to 20% of her annual salary. Assuming she gets paid 12 times a year (monthly), her monthly savings would be:

$100,000 per year * 0.20 = $20,000 per year
$20,000 per year / 12 months per year = $1,667 per month

However, to simplify the calculation, we can use the annual savings amount. 

To calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (the problem doesn't specify for how long), we can't determine the exact number of years she needs to work. However, we can determine the total number of years she needs to work to reach her goal, which is 40 years.

Assuming she has been working for some time already, let's assume she has been working for x years. Then the number of years she needs to work is 40 - x years.

He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, so the total weight is 3 * 10 = 30 ounces. 

Since an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it, the total number of M&M's is 30 * 30 = 900.

Now, if he puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is 900 / 10 = 90.

"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly half the circumference of the earth, we need to calculate half the circumference of the earth and then divide it by the distance Alfie flies in a day.

Half the circumference of the earth = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, divide the distance by the daily distance flown by Alfie:
20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
The average car can go 120 miles per hour. 
So, the 2nd fastest car can go 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 
So, the fastest car can go 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30. 

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30. 

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18. 

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9. 

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs. 

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. 

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs. 

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 

21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately and then add them together.

Weight of crayons: 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces
Weight of boxes: Since Nik has 200 crayons and he puts them into groups of 8, the number of boxes needed is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. 
Weight of boxes: 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Total weight in ounces: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert the total weight to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply that by the price per plank.

First, we find out how much of the tree can be used to make logs: 
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Then, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that time = distance / speed. So, the time she spends on the beach is 2 miles / x miles per minute = 2/x hours. We are given that this time is 40 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

2/x = 40/60 (converting 40 minutes to hours)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 60 = 40x
120 = 40x
x = 120/40
x = 3

So, her speed on the beach is 3 miles per hour, or 1/20 miles per minute (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Now, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is twice her speed on the beach:

2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute

The time she spends on the sidewalk is 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the time she spends on the beach plus the time she spends on the sidewalk:

40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach her goal, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far and how much more she needs to save.

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

She wants to save a total of $60, so she still needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she still needs to save by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can set up a weighted average equation to represent the situation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / (4 + 1) ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation:

(132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiplying both sides by 5:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

Total number of cows added in 21 days: 20 * 21 = 420
Total number of chickens added in 21 days: 10 * 21 = 210

Total number of cows after 21 days: 50 + 420 = 470
Total number of chickens after 21 days: 20 + 210 = 230

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks: 470 + 230 = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount.

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

With a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

It takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. 
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
$26 / $2 = 13

Since Faraday sells the sunflowers for 3 days, the total number of individual sunflowers sold is:
13 * 3 = 39

Now, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
$56 / $8 = 7

Since Faraday sells the bouquets for 3 days, the total number of bouquets sold is:
7 * 3 = 21

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets is:
21 * 12 = 252

Now, let's add the total number of individual sunflowers and the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets to find the total number of sunflowers sold:

The total revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is 12 * 7 = $84.

The total cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is 20 * 5 = $100.

Since Adam's total revenue ($84) is less than his total cost ($100), he incurs a loss. The amount of money he loses is $100 - $84 = $16.

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the non-yellow colors. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided among red, white, and purple.

Total paint used = 12 pints
Yellow paint = 1/2 * 12 = 6 pints
Non-yellow paint (red, white, purple) = 12 - 6 = 6 pints

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the non-yellow paint by 3.

Red paint = 6 / 3 = 2 pints

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. 
Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area:
960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and add them up.

On Monday, she saw 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find out how many pods are in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 
20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the new box costs $12, the cost per pod is 12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide $1 by the cost per pod.
$1 / $0.1 = 10

"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
   Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home.
   The number of 20 dollar bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   Half of 40 is 40 / 2 = 20. So, he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

4. The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = $400.

5. Thomas then triples his money.
   Tripling his money means multiplying by 3, so he now has 400 * 3 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.
   The number of 5 dollar bills is 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch of chalk per day (since 20% of the original 5 inches is 1 inch).

However, since the teacher only has 2.75 inches left, we should calculate 20% of the remaining chalk each day. 
20% of 2.75 is 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.

Now, we can divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used each day (0.55 inches) to find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk. However, we should calculate 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that had passed the expiry date.

Total gallons of milk sold = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5 = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk.
2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons of sour milk by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount.
Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount he spent ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

$27000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books.

Now, let's find out the total number of books he can buy: 
54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books.

Since he is distributing the books between 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3:

"Let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree initially.
2. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket.
3. The thrown apple caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. Now, he has 1 (initial) + 4 (from the 5 that fell) = 5 apples in his pocket.
4. The thrown apple caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples.

The total number of apples Newton picked up in the last step is 6 (that fell) + 1 (that he threw) = 7 apples. Adding these to the 5 apples already in his pocket, Newton has a total of 5 + 7 = 12 apples.

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay gains snowballs is the rate at which he builds them minus the rate at which they melt: 
1/3 - 2/15 = (5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate to find the time it will take: 
60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the third day's order.

However, we know they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means that before the third day's order, they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. 

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, before the first day's order, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages left from the second day. Then, before the first day's order, they had 31 + 38 = 69 bandages.

However, they ordered 50 bandages on the first day. So, they must have started with 69 - 50 = 19 bandages.

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3c - 2.

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3.

The number of cupcakes Carly made is 3."
"To find the total cost, first, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. There are 10 fingers, and each nail costs $3. So, the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost Karen would pay is the cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

Standard lessons: 4 hours * $80 per hour = $320
Veteran lessons: 2 hours * ($80 per hour - 25% of $80 per hour) 
Since 25% of $80 is $20, the reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.
Veteran lessons: 2 hours * $60 per hour = $120

Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day: $320 + $120 = $440

"To find out how much money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he sold to his uncle.

Walter started with 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. So, he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

He then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. So, he had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, the total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

"To find the distance covered by Michael, we need to calculate the total hours he traveled and then multiply it by his average speed.

There are 24 hours in a day. Since Michael traveled for 3 days, the total hours he traveled is:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we multiply the total hours by his average speed:
Distance covered = 72 hours * 50 km/hr = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the distance covered, we divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box. 
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00. 
The gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of cheddar cheese, so it's 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00.

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning and divide it by the total time available.

Total classrooms = 80
Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Total time spent cleaning = 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes

Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by 5:
1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes per day

Now, we need to convert the 8-hour workday to minutes:
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:
(240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% ≈ 50%

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to determine the total number of books one bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books (110) by the number of books one bookcase can hold (55). 

110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. 
The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

She will sell 60 eggs for $1 for every 3 eggs. 
So, she will sell 60 / 3 = 20 sets of 3 eggs for $1 each. 
Her total revenue will be 20 x $1 = $20.

Her profit will be her total revenue minus her total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate each type separately.

There are 4 people, and each person has a flashlight, so the total number of flashlights is 4. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, so that's 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights. The total number of flashlights is 4 + 16 = 20.

For the candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 candles. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the final answer.

Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
Weight of the two children: 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds
Total weight: 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the weight, we need to calculate 1% of the total weight.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Force needed to push the car: 16 pounds"
"To find the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the sum of all the sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

Given the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2(35)
Perimeter = 70

So James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To find out how many pounds of feed is left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total amount of feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, the total amount of feed consumed by all the pigs is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, John needs to buy 36 / 6 = 6 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so John needs to spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs.

"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on meditation and yoga separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes. 
Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation per week is 30 * 7 = 210 minutes. 
In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation is 210 * 4 = 840 minutes.

Charisma practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week. 
Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes. 
In 4 weeks, the total time spent on yoga is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks: 
840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time to hours, we can divide by 60:

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
