"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The number of eggs she sells is 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes every day at the farmers' market is 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original + 150% increase). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. 
The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, the $50,000 in repairs also contributed to the increased value. To find the actual selling price, we need to add the $50,000 to the new value of the original house, which is $200,000. But the $50,000 is already included in the 150% increase, so we just need to add the $50,000 to the original value of the house and then multiply by 2.5.

The original value of the house plus the repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. 
The new value is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000, but we need to use the $130,000 as the base for the 150% increase, so the new value is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000, but the $50,000 is already included in the 150% increase, so the new value is $200,000 + $50,000 - $80,000 * 1.5 = $200,000 + $50,000 - $120,000 = $130,000 * 2.5 = $325,000.

The selling price is $325,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000.

"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs 3 * 3 = 9 sprints per week.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total meters he runs per week is 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to find out the total amount of feed needed for the day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total amount needed: 60 - 40 = 20.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses in pairs, since every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass.

The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. So, the cost of 2 glasses is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the cost of 8 pairs of glasses. The cost of each pair is $8, so the cost of 8 pairs is 8 * $8 = $64.

However, this calculation assumes that the discount applies to every second glass, not just the second glass in each pair. To get the correct answer, we need to calculate the cost of the first 8 glasses (4 pairs) and the cost of the remaining 8 glasses.

The first 8 glasses cost 4 * $8 = $32. The remaining 8 glasses also cost 4 * $8 = $32, but the first glass in each pair costs $5, and the second glass costs $3. So, the cost of the remaining 8 glasses is 4 * $5 + 4 * $3 = $20 + $12 = $32.

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file, which takes 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he didn't move, so the distance traveled is 0 miles.

In the next 0.5 hours, he traveled at 30 mph, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours, he traveled at 80 mph, so the distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Total distance traveled in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total distance = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles

Initially, John drove 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he was from home is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Since he traveled 135 miles in the 4 hours after turning around, the distance he is from home now is:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the number of downloads in the third month, we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the total cost and the total earnings.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. Each year, the tree will earn $1.5 * 7 = $10.50 from selling lemons, but it will also cost $3 to water and feed the tree, resulting in a net gain of $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year.

To break even, Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of $90. We can divide the initial cost by the net gain per year to find the number of years it will take to break even:

$90 / $7.50 = 12 years

However, this is the number of years it will take to break even, not to start earning money. Since Carlos will start earning money after he breaks even, we need to add 1 year to the result.

12 + 1 = 13

But this is incorrect, as he will start earning money the year after he breaks even, but he will also be earning money that year, so the correct answer is 12 years.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. 
She sold 2 more to the red house. 
Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. 
She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. 
Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms and solve for x:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/2 + x/6 + 1 = 5
Combine like terms:
(6x - 2x - 6 - 3x + x + 6)/6 = 5

Marissa has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Time taken so far = 2 hours
Time left = Total time - Time taken so far
Time left = 3 hours - 2 hours
Time left = 1 hour

Now, we can find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. Since 1 liter was spilled, we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract his age at the time of his son's birth.

Since Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond's current age is 31 + 6 = 37.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 37 - 23 = 14.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's call the original price 'x'. Since Kyle got a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. We can write this as:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book is $26."

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a constant.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x
= 11(9)
= 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, the sum of gold and silver coins is equal to 110.

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, he must have sold 13 - x lego sets for $165. 

Let's find out how many lego sets he sold for $165. 
$165 / $15 = 11

So, he sold 11 lego sets. 

To find out how many lego sets he still has, we subtract the number of lego sets he sold from the total number of lego sets he had.

13 (total lego sets) - 11 (lego sets sold) = 2

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

Distance = speed * time. 
Distance covered while running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles.
Distance covered while walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to first find out how many blue ties he bought and then how many red ties he bought.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:

"To find out how much money Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches and the total number of students.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day, 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), which is 5 * 5 = 25 classes. 
On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. 
So, the total number of classes per week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students per week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount of money she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7425.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750.

The interest is 2% of $750, which is 0.02 * $750 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

$765 / 3 = $255.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days, so the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, so the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

The total amount of dog food for the rest of the year is:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

The total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year is:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

"To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we first need to find out how much laundry each of them does.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 4. 
David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 2.
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do by subtracting the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does.
Difference = 200 - 100 = 100

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower.

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the better price is the package of 2 flowers for $1.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. Since 18 is divisible by 2, Vincent can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each. The total cost will be 9 * $1 = $9.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3, he will need 6 packages (18 / 3 = 6). The total cost will be 6 * $2.50 = $15.

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

He bought 21 stickers.
He got 23 stickers for his birthday.
Total stickers = 10 + 21 + 23 = 54

He gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 for the greeting card.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
The 10% increase is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60.
So, her new monthly salary is $600 + $60 = $660.

Since this increase happens every year, after three years, her monthly salary will be:
Year 1: $660
Year 2: $660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio and then determine the fraction of the total that represents the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, so we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x
x = 840/20
x = 42

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42."
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he bought and multiply it by the cost of each shoe.

John has 3 children, and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child. Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes is:
3 children * 2 pairs/child * 2 shoes/pair = 12 shoes

The cost of each shoe is $60, so the total amount John paid is:
12 shoes * $60/shoe = $720

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find out how many vehicles were already at the port from the first day. 

On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles from the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day. To find the number of vehicles imported on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles from the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769.23 + (0.4 * $30,769.23)
New salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
New salary = $43,076.92

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $99,076.92

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. 
Total hours for Tuesday and Wednesday = 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. 
Total hours for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday = 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Total hours for the week = 8 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 28 (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) = 48 hours.

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

Distance at 10 miles per hour = Speed * Time = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Since Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, she has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left to run at 5 miles per hour.

Distance at 5 miles per hour = Speed * Time = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Total distance = Distance at 10 miles per hour + Distance at 5 miles per hour = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20.

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and Jennie added 20, we subtract 20 from 30 to find the original number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.
30 - 20 = 10

"To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards. 

We know that Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table. We also know that her husband bought a package of 5 spoons. 

So, if we subtract the 5 spoons her husband bought from the total number of spoons Julia had, we get: 
12 - 5 = 7

This means that Julia had 7 spoons from the package she bought. However, we also know that she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. 

So, if we add the 3 spoons she used to the 7 spoons she had left, we get: 
7 + 3 = 10

Therefore, Julia's package of spoons had 10 spoons.

The cost of a watermelon is 3 times the cost of a pepper, so it's 3 * $15 = $45.
The cost of an orange is $5 less than the cost of a watermelon, so it's $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost to the hospital and the total revenue from the patients.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes: 
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, convert the total time to hours: 
12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

The cost to the hospital is the time spent by the doctors multiplied by their hourly rate: 
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The revenue from the patients is the time spent by the doctors multiplied by the hospital's hourly rate: 
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit is the revenue minus the cost:

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 
So, his total mileage for Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

We are given that his total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. 
To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total mileage for Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday:

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q. 
We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation for W: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700. 
Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. 
Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700. 
Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W. 
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200. 
W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. 
So, the depth of the water on Wednesday is 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin separately and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. 
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add the number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's catch: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's catch: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
Total catch: 19 + 13 = 32

After 20 months, the price will be $103.18 + 20% of $103.18 = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82
After 22 months, the price will be $123.82 + 20% of $123.82 = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58
After 24 months, the price will be $148.58 + 20% of $148.58 = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30
After 26 months, the price will be $178.30 + 20% of $178.30 = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96
After 28 months, the price will be $213.96 + 20% of $213.96 = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75
After 30 months, the price will be $256.75 + 20% of $256.75 = $256.75 + $51.35 = $308.10

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to determine the total number of outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling an even number on the second roll. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 or 0.5. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 0.25.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage. The difference is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25.

So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. This will give us the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats: 140 - 50 = 90.

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages of rats. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 6 * number of rats. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats is 3 * number of rats per cage.

We can set up the equation: 6 * 3 * number of rats per cage = 90.

Solving for the number of rats per cage, we get: 
6 * 3 * number of rats per cage = 90
18 * number of rats per cage = 90

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. 
7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet.
3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese in his macaroni and cheese.

Now, we add the slices used for each meal together:
14 slices (lunch) + 9 slices (breakfast) + 8 slices (dinner) = 31 slices

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to add the initial number of pens she had to the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the number of pens she bought: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98.

"To find the required score, we first need to find the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will consider the best 5 scores out of 6.

The total score for an average of 93 in 5 tests is 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's find the total score of Brinley's best 4 scores out of the first 5 tests: 
92 + 100 + 89 + 86 = 367.

Since the lowest score will be removed, we will remove the lowest score (71) from the total. Now we need to find the score on the 6th test that will give us a total of 465 when added to 367 and the lowest score of the 6 tests is removed.

The lowest score of the 6 tests will be either 71 or the score on the 6th test. To achieve the required total, we will assume the score on the 6th test is higher than 71.

So, the total score of the 6 tests should be 465 + 71 = 536.

Now, subtract the total score of the first 5 tests from the total score of the 6 tests: 
536 - (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 536 - 438 = 98.

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers for the first 4 weeks and the last 3 weeks separately, then add them together.

For the first 4 weeks:
Micheal rode 5 times a week, so in 4 weeks, he rode 5 * 4 = 20 times.
Distance covered in the first 4 weeks = 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

For the last 3 weeks:
Micheal rode 2 times a week, so in 3 weeks, he rode 2 * 3 = 6 times.
Distance covered in the last 3 weeks = 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Total distance covered = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then add them together.

Weight of chocolate bars: 25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

Weight of candied apples: 80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Total weight of Joe's bag of candy: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To find the cost of each cup, we first need to find the total cost of 20 dozen cups and the total cost of half a dozen plates.

Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Since 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, the total cost of 20 dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. There are 20 dozen cups, which is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

The cost of each cup is the total cost of 20 dozen cups divided by the number of cups, which is $34800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. She also earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

The total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is $10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting) = $30.

Since the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70, Sara still needs $70 - $30 = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she still needs ($40) by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4). 

$40 / $4 = 10

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The number of red chickens is 4."
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to find the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

On the first day, there were 100 customers. 
On the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day, so there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

In 4 minutes, both pools lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now we know that the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay back. 

The amount borrowed is $2000, and she needs to pay an additional 10% of that amount. 
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.
So, the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. 
The total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980.

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in 3 years: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age in 3 years: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age in 3 years: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add their ages in three years and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can add these points to find out how many points they scored in total: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = cost of cake + cost of presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate, we need to calculate the number of cookies she ate on both days. 

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue: 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to find the total number of girls in the school and then the total number of girls in the first two classes.

Since the school is 50% girls and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60. 
The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school to find the number of girls in the third class: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the third class has 20 students, and 3 of them are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed x cougars. Then, he killed 3x wolves. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.

So, today Rick killed 12 cougars and 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

The total number of animals Rick killed today is 12 + 36 = 48.

The total number of animals Rick killed is 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73.

Now, subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down the slide.
30 - 9 = 21

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we first need to find the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. 

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200 cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, so the new total number of cows is 200 + 40 = 240 cows.

Since there are 20 stalls now (not 10), and the new cows are divided equally among them, we need to find the number of cows in each stall. 
240 cows / 20 stalls = 12 cows per stall.

Now, we need to find the number of cows in 8 stalls. 
8 stalls * 12 cows per stall = 96 cows.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree, we first need to find the total weight of the tree before the termites ate 30% of it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight of the tree by dividing the height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 and multiplying by 400 pounds.

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections
20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the weight after the termites ate 30% of the tree.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas each person has:
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner), the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is:
0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day

There are 5 members in the household, so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
0.4 kg/day * 5 members = 2 kg/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of rice consumed per week is:
2 kg/day * 7 days = 14 kg/week

Now, we can calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:
42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

"To find the total cost of driving per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven and multiply it by the cost per mile, then add the total bonus given to the driver per year.

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 (to and from work) = 60 miles
Total miles driven per week = 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles
Total miles driven per year = 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles

Cost per mile = $2
Total cost per year for miles driven = 15,000 miles * $2 = $30,000

Total bonus per year = $150 * 12 months = $1,800

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider how the pages are arranged when the paper is folded.

When the paper is folded, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)
...
Page 31 (back) and Page 32 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

32 pages / 2 = 16

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a straightforward manner. In reality, the pages are arranged in a way that the first and last pages are on the outside, and the second and second-to-last pages are on the inside, and so on.

To accommodate this arrangement, we need to consider that the first and last pages (1 and 32) are on the same piece of paper, the second and second-to-last pages (2 and 31) are on the same piece of paper, and so on.

This arrangement still results in 16 pieces of paper, but with a different page layout.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to find out how many books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, so she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

Now, we subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left: 
60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks, then multiply by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose that weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4.

6 business suits at $100 each will cost 6 * $100 = $600.
3 suitcases at $50 each will cost 3 * $50 = $150.
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500.
So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

Total expenses so far are $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.
He also wants to save $2000 for the trip.

Total money set aside for the trip is $1950 (expenses) + $2000 (savings) = $3950.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. 

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is 105, so we can set up the equation:
D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(2D + D) + D/2 = 105
3D + D/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
6D + D = 210
7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."

"To find the total number of legs, we need to know the number of chickens and cows. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's assume the number of cows is x. Then the number of chickens is 2x.

We know the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:
x + 2x = 60
Combine like terms:
3x = 60
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 20

So the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is:
40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs
20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
Total legs = 80 + 80 = 160

"To find the total weight of the container with all the animals, we need to find the weight of each animal first.

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds. 
Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds each.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds
Green toad: 50 pounds
Yellow snake: 60 pounds
Red bird: 30 pounds
Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total time John spent, we need to first calculate the time he spent on each activity. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 
So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so we can set up the equation:
15 = 0.3x, where x is the total time spent.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, the total time spent is 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50

The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled by the train in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

Dasha needs 9 rides, and each ride costs 2 tickets. So, she needs 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. Each ticket costs $2, so the total cost of Dasha's tickets is 18 * $2 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30.

The difference between the cost of Dasha's tickets and David's ride bracelet is $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of gifts (6 + 4 + 2).

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Now, divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

"To find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

We can then divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts (11) to find the value of one part: 165 / 11 = 15.

Since Betty has 5 parts, she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

"To find the savings, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and subtract it from the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the total cost is 2 * $10 * 0.8 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

The savings is the difference between the cost of the cable package and the cost of the streaming services: $60 - $26 = $34.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to first find the total time she spent on the song. 

She spent 4 hours writing the song. 
She spent half of 4 hours recording it, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours. 
She spent 90 minutes editing it, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Total time spent on the song is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

Now, we can find the percentage of time she spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total time and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she had initially and then subtract the cards she passed out, and add the cards she received.

Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so she had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards initially.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out 24 + 5 = 29 cards in total.

Now, we subtract the cards she passed out from the cards she had initially: 50 - 29 = 21.

Then, we add the cards she received: 21 + 17 = 38.

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. 1/4 of 12 slices is 12 * 1/4 = 3 slices.

Total slices given to Bill and Mark = 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny eats 2 slices.

Total slices left = Total slices - slices given to Bill and Mark - slices eaten by Jenny
Total slices left = 12 - 7 - 2

"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the number of days he works in a year and multiply it by his daily wage.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
52 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 312 days/year

However, the problem states that the builder works 4 weeks every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is:
12 months/year * 4 weeks/month = 48 weeks/year

So, the total number of days he works in a year is:
48 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

The builder's daily wage is $50. Therefore, his total earnings in a year are:

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, which is 60. So, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

The total number of corns is 80 + 20 = 100.

The book is 45 pages long, and it averages 200 words per page. So, the total number of words in the book is:
45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find the time it takes him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:
9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby needs is:
30 minutes (to read the book) + 10 minutes (to get to the airport) = 40 minutes

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30.
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

First, let's find the number of candles that will explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% will explode. 
1% of 50000 candles is 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles.

Next, let's find the number of candles that will smell like wet dog. 5% of the candles have this defect.
5% of 50000 candles is 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles.

However, we are interested in the intersection of the two events, i.e., the candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the two events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of the two events.

The probability of a candle exploding is 0.01, and the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 0.05. The probability of both events occurring is 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005.

Now, we can solve these two equations. Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting 'c' into the first equation:

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since Bill signed up for 2 years (24 months), we subtract the introductory period (6 months) and the increased rate period (10 months, since 24 - 6 - 8 = 10) to get the correct number of months at the normal rate.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: 
$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of:
$2 + $16 = $18

Now, we subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (Dora's money) = $1

"To find the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew in sequence.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is (3/4) * 100 = 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is (1/5) * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we need to first find out how many gallons were in 1/4 of a container. 

15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

1/4 of a container is 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, 3/4 gallons is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we first need to determine how much money he spent on chips and how much he had left to spend on candy bars.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, we subtract the money spent on chips from the total money spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide the remaining money by the cost of a candy bar: $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 
Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Since they are sharing the oranges equally with 6 other friends, the total number of people is 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8 people.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges everyone will get.
Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7.

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find the difference in their travel times and add the extra 5 minutes Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne.

It takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

The difference in their travel times is 16 - 4 = 12 minutes. However, Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we add this extra time to the difference.

12 minutes (difference in travel time) + 5 minutes (to arrive before Wayne) = 17 minutes.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to know the length and width of the room in feet. We are given the length in yards, so we need to convert it to feet first. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We are also given the area of the room, which is 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. 
1 pack of red beads = 1 * 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads.
3 packs of blue beads = 3 * 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth bought = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time and James' time for the swim and bike ride.

Jon's total time: 
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' time for the swim: 
- 10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' time for the bike ride: 
- 5 minutes longer than Jon's 80 minutes
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time:
- James' run time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (1 hour = 60 minutes).

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. 

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes
Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B = 80 minutes

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

Movie A = Movie B / 4
Movie A = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A = 20 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:
Total hay = Distance * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles * 0.5 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, let's calculate the change:
Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

Cost per balloon = $45 

After the price increase, the cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65. 

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. 
Cost of 170 balloons = Cost per balloon * Number of balloons 
Cost of 170 balloons = $65 * 170 
Cost of 170 balloons = $11,050

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 * $1500 = $300. So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.

For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is $10,000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15,400.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we can calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the total number of razors: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

Now, we substitute L and D in terms of B into the equation L + D + B = 43:
(B/2 + 7) + (B/2) + B = 43

Combine like terms:
2B/2 + 7 = 43
B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
B = 36

Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs = 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost. 

The total cost was $48, and the CD cost $4. So, the headphone set cost $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. 

$44 / $4 per CD = 11 CDs.

So, Tom could have bought 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphone set."
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours spent in the weeks with the usual 4 hours, the weeks with 5 hours, and the week with 6 hours.

Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks (since 2 weeks were 5 hours and 1 week was 6 hours). 
So, the total hours spent in those 5 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

For the 2 weeks with 5 hours each, the total hours spent is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

For the week with 6 hours, the total hours spent is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, we add the hours spent in all the weeks: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer than that would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Since Jame is currently 22 years old, in 8 years, he will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than this, so Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we can find the difference in their current ages: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. The cost of the computer and printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we first need to find the total number of seashells brought by the boys and the girls. 

Since there are 20 kids and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the total number of shells brought by the girls is 600 + (4 * 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 3000 / 10 = 300.

3. He adds another $10 the following day, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.
4. He spends $8, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.
5. He triples the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to find out how much he needs to save in total for the first and second half of the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half, let's assume the daily savings in the first half is x. Then, the daily savings in the second half will be 2x.

There are 30 days in April, so the first half will have 15 days and the second half will also have 15 days.

The total savings for the first half will be 15x and the total savings for the second half will be 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total savings for the month should be $1125, so we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

Since the daily savings in the second half is 2x, the daily savings in the second half will be 2 * 25 = 50.

"To find the total number of cards, we need to determine how many cards the brother has and add that to the number of cards the boy has.

The boy has 5 cards. 
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so the brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual and set temperatures, then divide by the set temperature.

Actual temperature = 468
Set temperature = 450
Difference = 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will give us an actual temperature of 520 degrees, with the oven being off by 4%.

Let's call the set temperature 'x'. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

Actual temperature = x + (0.04x)
= 1.04x

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so we set up the equation:

1.04x = 520

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 1.04:

x = 520 / 1.04
= 500

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the total time for the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, the total time for the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes each person brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend:
Judy's utensils: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36
Her friend's utensils: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84
Total utensils: 36 + 84 = 120

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes and then divide it by the total number of contacts.

1 box has 90 contacts and lasts 45 days, so 2 boxes will have 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, but it's 10% off, so the discounted price is:
$100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00 per box.

The total cost of 2 boxes is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts (1 for each eye), the cost per pair is:
$1.00 per contact * 2 contacts per pair = $2.00 per pair.

"To find out how much John and Jill earned, we need to calculate the total hours they worked and multiply it by their hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
John earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burned. 

She spent 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, she burned 2 * 500 = 1000 calories doing aerobics.

She also spent 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, she burned 1 * 600 = 600 calories running.

The total calories she burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many times 200 calories fit into 1600 calories. 

1600 / 200 = 8.

Now, we multiply the result by 100 ml to find out how many ml of water she needs to drink.

8 * 100 = 800.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Since the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B. The jar also contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide by 3:

B = 1500

Now we can find the number of red jelly beans (0.99B) and the number of green jelly beans (1.01B):

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:

If Martin eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds per week. Over 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is the difference between the weight gained and the weight lost: 8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 pounds.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per day, we need to calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms. 

Since 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms as follows:
3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Now, we can calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms:
200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we multiply the daily amount by 7:
6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: 
x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:
0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 
Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it is 2x. 
The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. 
The largest angle is 3x, which is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

In the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, let's subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 
48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to divide the remaining inches by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to be tall enough:

The selling price of each car is $25,000. 
The profit on each car is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500. 

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000. 
James' commission is 10% of the total profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25:
100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6:
25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men:

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

The price of the diamond jewel is $2000. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel.
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

The cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding their individual prices.

First, we need to find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Bob's speed from Tom's speed:
Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula:

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. 
Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily.

The total number of customers they process daily is 50 + 100 = 150.

Lynn's total miles = Reggie's total miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's total miles = 17 miles

Since we already know the number of good days in the first 33 days (12 + 2 = 14), and we know that the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral, we can find the number of good days left in the month by subtracting the good days in the first 24 days (8) and the good days in the next 9 days (6) from the total number of good days in the month (which we don't know). However, we do know that the month has 30 days, and we are given information about 33 days. 

Since we know that the first 30 days had 12 good days, and the next 3 days had 2 good days, we can assume that the month has 30 days, and the extra 3 days are part of the next month. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 12 - 8 = 4.

However, we are given that the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral. So, the last 6 days of the month had 4 good days, and the next 3 days had 2 good days. Since the last 6 days of the month had 4 good days, and the first 24 days had 8 good days, the total number of good days in the month is 8 + 4 = 12. 

However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month after the first 33 days. Since the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral, the last 9 days of the first 33 days had 6 good days (4 in the last 6 days of the month and 2 in the next 3 days). Since the first 24 days had 8 good days, the number of good days left in the month is 12 - 8 = 4.

However, we are given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. So, the number of good days left in the month is 4 - 0 = 4 (since the next 3 days are part of the next month).

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. 

Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so Janey has 2x + 3 books. 

Since Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation: 
2x + 3 = 21

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

The number of books Sally has is 9."
"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the current height from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches

Now, we need to find the difference between the desired height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches).

600 - 240 = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days.

360 / 30 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of toys James needs, we need to calculate the number of dogs he has to provide toys for.

Initially, James had 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means the number of dogs doubled. So, the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.

However, 3 dogs left, so we subtract 3 from the total number of dogs: 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

Katarina has 68 cookies. 
Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can add up the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298 cookies.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 1.5 times the original length (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 times). So, the length after extension is 1.5x.

She then adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length is 140cm. So, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:
1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 80

The original length of the dress is 80cm."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time taken for each mode and add them together. 

In turtle mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in turtle mode, the time taken is half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

In rabbit mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Since he mowed half the lawn in rabbit mode, the time taken is half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation: T = t + 7.

We know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44. Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get: 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin using the first equation: T = t + 7. Substituting t = 6, we get: T = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find out how many coins Neil has been saving per month, we need to calculate 2/5 times more than Rong's savings. 
Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total coins saved by Rong and Neil in a year. 
Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in a year (12 months), he saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins.
Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in a year (12 months), he saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

In 10 years, Rong will save 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
In 10 years, Neil will save 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they will have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to calculate the total bill first. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, and the dog needs 2 vaccines, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for the time with arms raised and the time with arms at her sides, then add them together.

When her arms are raised, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot. Since she does this for 2 minutes, the total taps with arms raised is:
2 minutes * 200 taps/minute * 2 feet = 800 taps

When her arms are at her sides, she taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps with arms at her sides is:
3 minutes * (300 taps/minute + 250 taps/minute) = 3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

Now, add the taps with arms raised and the taps with arms at her sides:
800 taps + 1650 taps = 2450 taps

"To find the total number of slices left, we need to calculate the slices eaten by each group and subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in this group, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices they had is 3 * 12 = 36 slices. They ate 2/3 of 36 slices, which is (2/3) * 36 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people in this group, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices they had is 2 * 12 = 24 slices. They ate ¾ of 24 slices, which is (3/4) * 24 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

The total number of slices initially is 5 * 12 = 60 slices (since there are 5 people in total).

The number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

For students' cars, there are 64 cars with 4 windows each, so the total number of windows is 64 * 4 = 256. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, she smashes 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

Initially, there were 5000 people. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. 
2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted, and 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, by 16:00, a total of 2000 (by midday) + 2000 (by 16:00) = 4000 people had voted.

Total s'mores needed: 18 s'mores + 6 s'mores = 24 s'mores

Since each sleeve makes 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for 9 large buttons (since 3 small stickers = 1 large button).

Now she has 3 small stickers left and 40 large stickers.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 20 large buttons, and 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers, 20 large buttons, and 60 small buttons.

She also had 9 large buttons from the first trade. So in total, she has 20 + 9 = 29 large buttons.

Since 1 large button = 3 small buttons, the total number of buttons she has is 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons (3 small stickers = 3 small buttons, and she already had 60 small buttons). 

Since 3 small buttons = 1 large button, we can convert the small buttons to large buttons. 63 small buttons = 63 / 3 = 21 large buttons.

"To find the total number of books read, we first need to find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find Ahmed's total.

Ezra read 300 books. 
Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we add the number of books Ezra read initially (300) to the number of books he decided to read (150) to find his total. 
Ezra's total = 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Now, we add Ezra's total to Ahmed's total to find the overall total.
Total books read = 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600 books.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she doesn't earn the additional $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 + $30 = $110.

Bennet sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 * $3 = $60 from the eggplants.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from the eggplants from the total amount he wants to make. This will give us the amount he needs to make from selling the corn.

$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we know that Bennet needs to make $75 from selling 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn.

"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to find the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time remaining after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Time remaining after reading - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent playing soccer:
Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of movie separately.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

The cost of these movies is 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, which is:
$10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie
The total cost of the movies in series is:

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies:
600 - 200 = 400 movies

40% of these movies are older movies, which is:
400 * 0.4 = 160 movies

The cost of these older movies is $5 each, so the total cost is:
160 * $5 = $800

The remaining movies are:
400 - 160 = 240 movies

The cost of these movies is $10 each, so the total cost is:
240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars (but we are told only two pizzas cost 30 dollars, so we can only subtract 30 dollars from the total). 

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. 

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is 2x.

We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so x + 2x = 17.

Combine like terms: 3x = 17.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 17/3, but since x must be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a fish), we can try x = 5 and 2x = 10 (orange) and 5 (white) which adds up to 15, or x = 6 and 2x = 12 (orange) and 6 (white) which adds up to 18. Since 17 is between 15 and 18, we can try x = 5 and 2x = 10 (orange) and 5 (white) and add 2 more orange fish to make 17.

So, Bob initially had 3 orange and 4 white fish. He bought 5 white and 12 orange fish. 

The number of white fish he bought is 5.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he drives in a week and the total amount of gas he uses.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.

In a week, Andy drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, the total amount of gas he uses in a week is 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7:

Dale initially ordered 100 candies, then he ordered 100 more, so the total number of candies he has is:
100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200

He has already sold 150 candies, so the number of candies he still needs to sell is:
200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

"To find the number of additional students, we first need to find the total number of students at the end of May. 

Since the number of students doubles every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:
- Beginning of the year: 10 students
- End of January: 10 * 2 = 20 students
- End of February: 20 * 2 = 40 students
- End of March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
- End of April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
- End of May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

Now, to find the number of additional students, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:
320 (total students) - 10 (initial students) = 310

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total branches by 7 to find the average branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

2. 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
3. 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
4. 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals initially: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 flower of each type, we need to subtract the petals of the dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals

"To find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag, we need to first calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows. 

Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Now, we subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag.

Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since there are 2 kids, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have.

S'mores per kid = 14 / 2 = 7

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long, so they can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of zest as 'x'. Then the amount of fragrance is also 'x'. The amount of salt is 2x, and the amount of sugar is also 2x. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so it's 2 * 2x = 4x.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10

Combine like terms:
x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10
10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
x = 1

Now that we know x is 1, we can find the amount of oil:
Oil = 4x
Oil = 4 * 1
Oil = 4

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

Now, let's calculate the number of cars Joe has left. He initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, the number of cars Joe has left is 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

5 tasks * $1.20 per task = $6 per cycle

Since John does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are:

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this number gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the question states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built, not build double the amount. So, in the third year, they will build the same number of homes as the first two years combined, which is 48 homes.

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 48 = 96.

"Let's denote my age as 'A', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'S'. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, A = B - 3.
Since I am 2 years older than my sister, A = S + 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so mom's age = 3B - 1.

When you add all our ages, you get 87, so A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87.

Substituting A = B - 3 and A = S + 2 into the equation, we get:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 + 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine like terms:
6B - 5 = 87
Add 5 to both sides:
6B = 92
Divide by 6:
B = 15.33 (round down to 15 since age can't be in fractions)

Now that we know B, we can find A:
A = B - 3
A = 15 - 3
A = 12

The answer is: 12"
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to find out the total number of glue sticks required. 

There are 27 students, and each student needs 2 glue sticks. 
Total glue sticks required = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in a pack and round up to the nearest whole number (since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs).

Number of packs required = Total glue sticks required / Number of glue sticks in a pack
= 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack
= 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number. 
Number of packs required = 7 packs

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, she earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, let's compare the number of badges Wendy and Amber earn in a year. Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges. To find the difference, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

Number of silver coins = Number of gold coins - 30
Number of silver coins = 70 - 30
Number of silver coins = 40

Now, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins.

Total number of coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total number of coins = 70 + 40

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We know that S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne) 
and A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn).

We also know that S + A + F = 85 (Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books).

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
(2A + 25) + F = 85

Now, substitute A = F - 12 into the equation above:
(2(F - 12) + 25) + F = 85
(2F - 24 + 25) + F = 85
(2F + 1) + F = 85
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

To make 20 small masks, she will need (20 / 4) * 2 = 10 yards of material.

For large masks: 
Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, she will need (8 / 3) * 2.25 = 6 yards of material.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking) = 19 hours.

Now, subtract the total hours spent on these activities from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Duncan's current age be D and Adam's current age be A.

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was D - 8, and Adam's age four years ago was A - 4.

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can set up the equation:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60, so D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides gives:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

A = 30

So Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
= 38

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. 
Twice Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
100 acres more than that is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

Now, divide the total miles driven by the number of miles his car can go before needing a tune-up:

"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we subtract 15 from the total number of cups.

Total cups = 27
Cinnamon tea cups = 15
Chamomile and mint tea cups = Total cups - Cinnamon tea cups
Chamomile and mint tea cups = 27 - 15
Chamomile and mint tea cups = 12

Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows and creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we divide the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups by 3 and then divide by 2 (since there are two types of tea).

Cups per row = (Chamomile and mint tea cups) / 3

10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water

Now, we need to subtract the amount of water used each day for 6 days from the initial amount of water in the tank. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, the amount of water used will be:

We know that P = L + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)
We also know that L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
And the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so P + L + J = 100

Substituting L = J + 10 into P = L + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substituting P = 2J + 10 and L = J + 10 into P + L + J = 100, we get
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find L: L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And we can find P: P = L + J = 30 + 20 = 50

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He sold 5 CDs for $40, but we need to find out how much he paid for those 5 CDs. Since he paid $90 for 10 CDs, the cost per CD is $90 / 10 = $9. He sold 5 CDs, so he paid $9 * 5 = $45 for those CDs.

The amount he got back from selling the CDs is $40.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid: $90 - $40 = $50.

"Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 with A + 20. 
A + (A + 20) + D = 45

Since B = D + 10, we can substitute D in the equation A + (A + 20) + D = 45 with B - 10. 
A + (A + 20) + (B - 10) = 45

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation A + (A + 20) + (B - 10) = 45 with A + 20. 
A + (A + 20) + (A + 20 - 10) = 45

Combine like terms: 
A + A + 20 + A + 20 - 10 = 45
3A + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides: 
3A = 15

Divide both sides by 3: 
A = 5

The answer is 5."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to first find the total number of pages per inch, considering that each paper is printed on both sides. Since there are 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, the actual number of pages per inch is 200 (100 pages per inch * 2 sides per paper).

Now, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches to find the total number of pages. 

Number of pages per inch: 200 pages/inch
Thickness of the book: 1.5 inches

Total number of pages = Number of pages per inch * Thickness of the book
Total number of pages = 200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to find the total time Vince spent stapling reports and then calculate the number of reports stapled in that time.

Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 hours is equal to 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

We know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 / 15 = 60

Now, we multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports stapled in each interval:
60 * 30 = 1800

"To find the total minutes Kim slept, we need to calculate the total time she was supposed to sleep and subtract the time she was awake.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.

Total time she was supposed to sleep: 8 hours = 8 * 60 minutes = 480 minutes
Time she woke up early: 5 minutes
Time she was sleepwalking: 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes

Total time she was awake: 5 minutes + 23 minutes = 28 minutes

Now, subtract the time she was awake from the total time she was supposed to sleep:

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of occupied beds initially and then the number of beds occupied after 2 weeks.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 
1/5 of 1000 is 1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds occupied initially.

The number of unoccupied beds initially is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 
In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

"To find the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to calculate the total number of holes at the end of the first day and then multiply it by 4 to get the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day. 

The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.

The total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 times the number of holes at the end of the first day, which is 4 * 10 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they also filled in 2 holes on the third day. 

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

Now, we subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught as 'x'. 

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is 4x - 13.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokémon Alex has caught is (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8.

The total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so we can set up the equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:
9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9x = 360

Divide by 9:
x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokémon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 4(40) - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 160 - 13
Stan's Pokémon = 147

Stan has caught 147 Pokémon."

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each direction and then find the net distance.

Distance traveled south in the first leg = speed * time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles
Distance traveled north in the second leg = speed * time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Distance traveled south in the third leg = speed * time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled north in the second leg, we subtract this distance from the total distance traveled south:
Net distance = Distance traveled south in the first leg + Distance traveled south in the third leg - Distance traveled north in the second leg
Net distance = 300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 374 miles

25% of 8 is 0.25 * 8 = 2 years.
So, Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages:

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away:
4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, she has 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.

She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is:

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

Total gingerbread boxes sold = 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes

On Sunday, Sunny sold 15 boxes of apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Total apple pie boxes sold = 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between France and Germany. 

So, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to first find the age of Helene. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. 

The total age of the children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H.

We can write the equation for the total age: 
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. There are 4 children, so the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, her age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now we can substitute H = 10 into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. 

The neighbors donated $500, and the online fund collected $1500. The total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend also donated $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match. 

The lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. So, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2000 = $6000.

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we divide the total number of cookies by 2:
1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person in the church received:
750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine the total number of slices and the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the total number of slices is 6 (2 adults and 4 kids). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can represent the size of the slices as follows:

Adults: 2x, 2x
Kids: x, x, x, x

The total size of the slices is 2x + 2x + x + x + x + x = 8x

Each adult gets 2x, so the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is:

(2x / 8x) * 100% = 25%

"To find the total time spent on rounds, we multiply the time per inpatient (20 minutes) by the number of inpatients (9). 
9 * 20 = 180 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
180 / 60 = 3 hours

To find the total time spent on appointments, we multiply the time per appointment (30 minutes) by the number of appointments (10).
10 * 30 = 300 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
300 / 60 = 5 hours

Now, we add the time spent on rounds (3 hours) and appointments (5 hours) to find the total time spent on these activities.
3 + 5 = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time to find the time left to update his records.

4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."

"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we need to calculate the total gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so Ms. B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped in two days is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 9000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 9000 = 9000 gallons.

"To find the initial charge of the power bank, we need to work backwards. 

First, let's calculate the charge lost in the last 3 hours when the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. 

Since the charge remaining was 28% after 3 hours, we can set up an equation to find the charge before the last 3 hours:

Let x be the charge before the last 3 hours.
x - 3 * 0.07x = 0.28
x - 0.21x = 0.28
0.79x = 0.28
x = 0.28 / 0.79
x = 0.354 or 35.4%

Now, let's calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours when the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour.

Let y be the initial charge of the power bank.
y - 5 * 0.09y = 0.354
y - 0.45y = 0.354
0.55y = 0.354
y = 0.354 / 0.55
y = 0.643 or 64.3%

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save. 

The down payment is 20% of the cost of the car, which is $10,000. 
20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total hourly income. 
She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly income is $10 + $15 = $25.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly income is $25 * 40 = $1,000.

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks she needs to work to save the down payment. 
Number of weeks = Total amount needed / Weekly income

Total cost of fruits purchased = $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $.25 each, Jamaar can buy $0.75 / $.25 = 3 plums.

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is $4. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is $12 * L, and the total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is $4 * S. Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation:

Combine like terms:
$12L + $8L = $120
$20L = $120

Divide both sides by $20:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2
Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Now, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one pack to find the number of packs.
Number of apples in one pack = 8
Number of packs = Total number of apples / Number of apples in one pack = 80 / 8 = 10

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of cash she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so she will have $50 - $40 = $10 left to buy meat.

"To calculate the total amount of loans Jim took, we multiply the annual loan amount by the number of years he was in college: 
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we multiply his annual income before college by the number of years he was in college: 
$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples to $75,000 per year. To calculate how long it would take him to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the lost income, we divide the total amount by his new annual income: 
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

"To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. 

The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 

So, the length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet.
The width of the fabric pieces will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to find the area of one piece and then multiply it by 2.

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

"To find the total number of letters delivered, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day to find the total:

"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Total loss = $5 (lost) - $11 (won) + $16.50 (lost) = $10.50

Since there were 3 races, the average loss is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so the sum of the shares of the three people is equal to $1920:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine x terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Since the team worked 3/8ths of a day each day, the total hours worked by the team in 21 days is:
21 days * (3/8) * 24 hours/day = 21 * 3 * 3 hours = 189 hours.

Now, divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters:
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

Combine like terms and multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

James walked halfway to the store, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles. Then, he walked back home, which is another 2 miles. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store. 

So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles + 2 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, the total time it took him to reach the store is 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

"To find the amount of money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually.

Jenny bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, so she bought 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying the bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.

The cost of buying the bananas in bunches is 10 * $3.00 = $30.

The amount of money Jenny saved is $32 - $30 = $2.

"To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes * $250 (half the price of an MTB) = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The number of bales left in the field is the difference between the number of bales made and the number of bales picked up: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To find the extra learning time, we need to calculate 1/16 of his weekly minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends 1/16 of this time on extra learning, which is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes per week.

However, this is the total extra time for both Saturday and Sunday. Since the question states he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday, we need to divide this by 2. So, the extra learning time per week is 630 minutes.

The total time John spends learning is 1600 + 630 = 2230 minutes per week.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 2230 / 60 = 37.17 hours.

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to first find out how many bags of apples were sold. 

Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the number of bags sold.

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, the initial weight of the triceratops was 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the number of shaken and unshaken sodas left.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, and Ellen shook 3 of them. So, there were 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas.

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas left is 2 + 6 = 8.

The likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, multiplied by 100.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of days Billy works, we first need to find the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

So, Billy works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people he helps is 6 * 40 = 240.

Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha:

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how many years it will take her to reach that goal.

Lauren's retirement savings goal is to live on 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years. 40% of $100,000 is $40,000 per year. For 20 years, she will need:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Since Lauren is saving 20% of her current annual salary, she is saving:

$100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year

To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by the amount she is saving per year:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

Since Lauren wants to retire in 20 years, she will need to work for 40 years to reach her retirement savings goal. However, the question asks how many more years she needs to work, so we subtract the number of years she has already worked (which is not given) from the total number of years she needs to work. Assuming she has just started working, the number of years she needs to work is 40 years.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 
21 - 13 = 8

"To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately, then add them together.

Weight of crayons: 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces
Weight of boxes: Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box holds 8 crayons, the number of boxes is 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. 
Weight of boxes: 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Total weight in ounces: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert the total weight to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):
400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply that by the price of each plank.

First, we find out how much of the tree can be used to make logs: 
80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Then, we divide the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the total number of logs:
64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Next, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log to find the total number of planks:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, we multiply the total number of planks by the price of each plank to find the total amount John makes:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to calculate the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that time = distance / speed. So, the time she spends on the beach is 2 miles / x miles per minute = 2/x minutes. We are given that this time is 40 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

2/x = 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x:

2 = 40x

Now, divide both sides by 40:

x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2(1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The time she spends on the sidewalk is 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk is the time she spends on the beach (40 minutes) plus the time she spends on the sidewalk (10 minutes):

40 + 10 = 50

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can set up a weighted average equation to represent the situation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / (4 + 1) ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation:

(132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiplying both sides by 5:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

With a 10% discount, the cost is $40.00 - (10% of $40.00) = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

Now, we can find the cost of each single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

It takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
So, it takes 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

Now, let's find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. 
Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. 
So, Gomer ate 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total number of eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Now, we add the number of green and red jellybeans to find the total number of non-blue jellybeans.

Total non-blue jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51

9/14 = x/84

Cross-multiplying, we get:
9 * 84 = 14x
756 = 14x
x = 756 / 14

"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day. 
Faraday earned $26 from individual sunflowers per day, and each sunflower costs $2. 
So, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is 26 / 2 = 13.

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. 
Faraday earned $56 from bouquets per day, and each bouquet costs $8. 
So, the number of bouquets sold per day is 56 / 8 = 7.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is 7 * 12 = 84.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day. 
Total sunflowers per day = individual sunflowers per day + sunflowers in bouquets per day
Total sunflowers per day = 13 + 84 = 97

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, multiply the total sunflowers per day by 3.
Total sunflowers in 3 days = 97 * 3 = 291

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling the rocks, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:
100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks:
20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7, so the total revenue is:
12 * 7 = $84

The total cost of the rocks is:
20 * 5 = $100

To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:
100 - 84 = $16

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to add the days for each type of scene. However, this would be incorrect as it assumes she works on one type of scene exclusively until it's done. A better approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days for each type of scene or to find the most efficient way to complete the scenes.

A more efficient way is to calculate the total number of days by finding the maximum number of days for any one type of scene and then checking if the other scenes can be completed within that time frame or less.

However, a simpler approach is to calculate the total number of days by adding the days for each type of scene and then checking if there's any overlap or if the scenes can be completed in less time.

9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days

However, this is not the most efficient way. A more efficient way is to calculate the total number of days by finding the maximum number of days for any one type of scene and then checking if the other scenes can be completed within that time frame or less.

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. 

If Lauren draws large-sized picture scenes for 9 days, she will complete 45 large-sized picture scenes. In the remaining time, she can draw medium-sized and small-sized picture scenes.

In 9 days, she can draw 9 * 6 = 54 medium-sized picture scenes, but she only needs 36. So, she can complete the medium-sized picture scenes in less than 9 days.

In 9 days, she can draw 9 * 7 = 63 small-sized picture scenes, but she only needs 49. So, she can complete the small-sized picture scenes in less than 9 days.

However, she can't complete the small-sized picture scenes in less than 7 days. So, she can complete the large-sized and medium-sized picture scenes in the remaining 2 days after completing the small-sized picture scenes.

So, the total number of days is 7 + 2 = 9 days for large and medium, but she can do the large and medium in the time it takes to do the small.

The total amount of paint is 12 pints. Half of that is 12 / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint. The remaining half is also 6 pints, which is the total amount of red, white, and purple paint.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

6 / 3 = 2

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet. 
Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

The total area of the house is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

On Tuesday, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

"To find out how many pods are in the special size box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 
20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we can find out how many pods you get per dollar by dividing the number of pods by the cost. 
120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles per dollar."
"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
   Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home.
   The remaining number of 20 dollar bills is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

4. The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = $400.

5. Thomas then triples his money.
   Tripling $400 gives 3 * 400 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.
   The number of 5 dollar bills is 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A's total goals: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B's total goals: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals
- Total goals scored in the match: 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find 20% of the original 5 inches, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used each day (1 inch), but we also need to consider that the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. 
2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days. Since the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we round down to 2 days, because on the third day, the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches.

However, we can calculate the exact amount of chalk left after 2 days. 
After 2 days, the teacher will have 2.75 - 2 * 1 = 0.75 inches left. 
On the third day, the teacher will use 1 inch of chalk, but he only has 0.75 inches left, which is less than 1 inch but also less than 2 inches. 
So, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days and then he will have to recycle it on the next day when he tries to use it.

The answer is: 3"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to first find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that had passed the expiry date.

Total gallons of milk purchased = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost of milk purchased = 4000 * $3.5 = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk purchased.
2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost of the milk that had passed the expiry date.
Cost of sour milk = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, the total number of snowballs that melt in an hour is 2 * 4 = 8.

So, Jay's net snowball production rate per hour is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. 

So, at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left, and they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the order on the third day. This means they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Since they had 3 bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day, and they used 28 bandages on the second day, they must have had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the end of the first day.

We know they had 12 bandages left from the order on the first day, so they must have started with 31 - 12 = 19 bandages.

"To find the total volume of the jar, we multiply the base area by the height. 
The base area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. 
The volume is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume of jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we divide the actual volume of jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans. 
Total jelly beans = 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. 
The difference between the true number and the estimated number is 900 - 864 = 36.

"To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people already on the bus and subtract that from the bus's capacity.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 
At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. 
So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. 
3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. 
So, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. 
So, the total number of people on the bus after the third stop is 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. 
The number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost per visit is $2. Pauline visits 3 times a year, so the cost per year is 2 * 3 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. This means the new cost per visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = 2 + 3 = $5. Pauline visits 3 times a year, so the cost per year is 5 * 3 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years: 30 + 45 = $75.

There are 4 grades (4-7) and 10 students per grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups. 

40 / 8 = 5 groups.

Each group uses 45 minutes, so we multiply the number of groups by the time per group to find the total time.

5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet.

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:
4x = 4 * 8 = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he will use. 

Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he will use.

80 / 16 = 5

So, Aiden will use 5 pounds of ground beef. 

Since he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

The discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and assuming she has 10 fingers, the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost is $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $30 (nail art) = $90.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, a single bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books (110) by the number of books a single bookcase can hold (55).

Now, let's add up the number of people for the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.

For the rest of the week (4 days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So, the total number of people for the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add the total number of people for the first three days and the rest of the week: 260 + 240 = 500 people.

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to four times the initial popping rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of popped kernels: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

However, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since Vanessa runs 2 miles in 32 minutes, she would run 4 miles in 64 minutes.

"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we need to multiply the length of the dock by 3, since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

Length of dock: 200 feet
Line needed per foot of dock: 3 feet
Total line needed: 200 * 3 = 600 feet

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract that from the total amount needed:

600 - 6 = 594 feet

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes per night, we need to calculate the total amount spent per reservation and then multiply it by the number of reservations.

Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the total cost of meals is 2 * $5 = $10. 
Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total amount spent per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since there are 6 reservations per night, the total amount made per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total amount made per week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to find the cost price of each watermelon. 

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 
Cost price per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.
Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60
Profit per watermelon = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit per watermelon = $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per watermelon = $2.00

"To find the answer, we need to determine the current age of John's youngest son. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John was 19 years old when James was born, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. To find the youngest son's current age, we subtract 32 from John's current age: 37 - 32 = 5 years.

To find the youngest son's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 5 + 3 = 8 years.

"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges in an hour.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. So, Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges in an hour.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320. The price Mark pays for the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic's labor costs $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. The total labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark pays is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. So we can write:

2c + 4w = 70

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' by first multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2c + 2w = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get:

2w = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

w = 15

Now we can substitute this value back into the first equation to get:

c + 15 = 20

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives:

c = 5

So the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to first find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Since there are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends), we divide the total slices by 4.

Slices per person = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person
