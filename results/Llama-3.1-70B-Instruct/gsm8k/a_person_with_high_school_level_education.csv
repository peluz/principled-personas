"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to first find out how many eggs she sells. 

She starts with 16 eggs per day. 
She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
She bakes muffins with 4 eggs, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. 
So, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and subtract the total cost from it.

The original value of the house was $80,000. After repairs, the value increased by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
New value = Original value + Increase in value
New value = $80,000 + $120,000
New value = $200,000

The total cost for Josh is the cost of the house plus the cost of repairs.
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total cost = $130,000

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value.
Profit = New value - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs 3 * 3 = 9 sprints per week.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total meters he runs per week is 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to first calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given so far from the total amount of feed needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
Every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide them into pairs (first and second glass). There will be 8 pairs of glasses.

The cost of each pair is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

The cost of 8 pairs is 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to find out how many sheep each city has. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download 200 GB is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he was in standstill traffic, so he didn't move.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drove at 30 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drove at 80 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

However, we also need to consider the distance he traveled before turning around, which is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay separately.

Regular pay: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime pay: 5 hours * (1.2 * $10/hour) = 5 * $12 = $60

Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the number of downloads in the third month, we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the total cost and the total earnings.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. Each year, the cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. The total cost after 'n' years will be 90 + 3n.

Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each. So, the total earnings per year will be 7 * $1.5 = $10.5. The total earnings after 'n' years will be $10.5n.

To start earning money, the total earnings should be more than the total cost. We can set up an equation:

10.5n > 90 + 3n

Subtract 3n from both sides:
7.5n > 90

Divide both sides by 7.5:
n > 12

Since 'n' represents the number of years, it should be a whole number. Therefore, it will take Carlos 13 years for the total earnings to be more than the total cost.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3.

She sold 2 more to the red house.

Now, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

Now, she has (x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's multiply both sides by 2:

2(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 = 10

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3x - x - 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4

Remaining students = 20 - 4 = 16

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"To determine the profit from each option, we need to calculate the increase in value for each.

For the jewelry: 
Initial value = $5,000
Increase rate = 2.5% = 0.025
Increase in value = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
New value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit = New value - Initial value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Initial value = $8,000
Increase rate = 1.2% = 0.012
Increase in value = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
New value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit = New value - Initial value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the jewelry, which gives a higher profit.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her total earnings from teaching and coaching.

As a teacher, she earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

As a coach, she earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

Annual salary: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

There are 7 days in a week. Claire eats 3 eggs per day. So, in a week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days = 21 eggs.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs she will eat.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles) in 2 hours. So, she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Now, we can find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water. Since 1 liter was spilled, we have 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. 
The amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 9 = 6 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. We have 15 liters of pineapple drink.
The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters.
Total water = 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find Raymond's current age and then subtract his son's age from it.

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is 31 years old now, we can find Raymond's age by adding 6 to Samantha's age.

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age.

Years ago = Raymond's current age - age when son was born
Years ago = 37 - 23
Years ago = 14

The total cost of the other items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we can divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find out how many boxes she ordered:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:

Allen's current age = 11x
= 11(9)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we need to find 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.

25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to find out how much money he made from selling his lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 x $15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 x $20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

Since he made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend $30. 

$30 is the price of 2 lego sets ($15 x 2 = $30), so John still has 2 lego sets.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

Distance = speed * time. 
Distance covered while running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles.
Distance covered while walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's find the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number of Post-it notes she used.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. 
She bought x Post-it notes.
She used 220 Post-it notes.

The total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package is 80 + x.
The total number of Post-it notes she had after using 220 is 80 + x - 220.

We know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall. 
So, 80 + x - 220 = 23.

Now, let's solve for x:
80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to first find out how many blue ties he bought and then how many red ties he bought.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find out how many blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:
Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find out how much John spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:
Amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find out the total amount John spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
Total amount spent on ties = Amount spent on blue ties + Amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building and then the number of occupied units.

The total number of units in the building is the number of floors multiplied by the number of units per floor:
15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4:
120 units * 3/4 = 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
120 units - 90 units = 30 units

"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to find out how much weight he removed by taking out the comic books. 

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the weight removed from the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds. So, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) and then multiply it by the total capacity of the tank.

First, let's calculate the miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill up again. Since the tank was not empty when she started (it was 12 - 4 = 8 gallons full), we can assume she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. 

However, to get the miles per gallon, we should consider the total amount of gas used for the 100 miles traveled. Since the tank was 8 gallons full initially and 4 gallons were added, we can assume 4 gallons were used from the 8 gallons that were in the tank initially. So, the total amount of gas used for the 100 miles is 4 gallons (from the 8 gallons) + 4 gallons (added) = 8 gallons were not used, 4 gallons were used from the 8 gallons and 4 gallons were added to make the tank full, so 4 gallons were used for the 100 miles.

mpg = miles / gallons = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Now, we can multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

Total miles = mpg * total gallons = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 * 4 = 40.

Each school has 2 coaches (1 for each team), so the total number of coaches is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we add the total number of players and coaches to get the final answer.

Total number of people = Total number of players + Total number of coaches
Total number of people = 40 + 8

20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Children eat half as much as adults, so they eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs each. 
There are 5 children. 
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, add the amount the adults and children will eat together. 
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

"To find Jackson's age, we need to figure out the ages of the other kids first. 

We know James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age. Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Jackson's age is 4."
"To find Gerald's original time, we need to add 2 seconds to Lee's time since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. 

Lee's time: 38 seconds
Gerald's original time: 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds
Gerald's improved time: 40 - 4 = 36 seconds

"To find the total number of pets, we need to find the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats. 

We know that there are 60 dogs. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180.

The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

The total number of pets is the sum of the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats: 168 + 60 + 120 = 348.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to determine how many cans of tomatoes she used. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the 32 ounces of sauce would have come from 64 ounces of tomatoes (since 64 / 2 = 32).

Now, we know that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total ounces of tomatoes (64) by the ounces per can (16). 

64 / 16 = 4

So, Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes.

4 * 3 = 12

Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes is:
30 - 5 - 20 = 5

However, this is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the cars that took the exit is not included in the 5. The 5 is the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants initially. She also received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of plants she has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 plants.

The number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 20 * 1/4 = 5. 
So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we can add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell to find the total number of doorbell rings:
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

The total number of pages Solo needs to read is 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages.

Since Solo already read 15 pages on Monday, he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read.

Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days: 24 / 4 = 6.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed). There are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) for 2 days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water. He also drinks 1 glass of water with dinner on one of the weekend days, so that's 1 more glass of water. So, on weekends, he drinks 6 + 1 = 7 glasses of water.

In total, John drinks 20 + 7 = 27 glasses of water in a week.

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

The inner volume of each box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. 
On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. 
On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, we subtract the hours watched on other days from the total hours: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by the length of each episode (30 minutes) to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using a variable to represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Let's call this number x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, the number of cookies he meant to bake this year is 2x.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

Unfortunately, he dropped 5 cookies, so the total number of cookies he has now is (2x + 15) - 5.

We are told that this number is equal to 110, so we can set up the equation:

(2x + 15) - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 50

So Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Beatrice's roll-ups were 2 wide and 24 long, so she ate 2 x 24 = 48 roll-ups.

Marcell's roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long, so he ate 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups.

The total number of roll-ups eaten is 48 + 42 = 90.

To find the average, we divide the total by 2 (since there are 2 people): 90 / 2 = 45.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many feet Julia rowed to reach the shore. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can find the total distance by setting up a proportion: 
16 seconds / 20 feet = 64 seconds / x feet

Cross-multiplying, we get: 
16x = 64 * 20
16x = 1280
x = 1280 / 16
x = 80 feet

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can find out how much water the boat took on. The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. 
80 feet / 10 feet = 8

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

It is given that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The cost price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price.
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost price

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769 + (0.4 * $30,769)
New salary = $30,769 + $12,308
New salary = $43,077 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,077
Total salary = $99,077

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we find the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Total unicorns = 27
Unicorns in Scottish Highlands = 1/3 * 27 = 9

Next, we find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this as follows:

Female unicorns in Scottish Highlands = 2/3 * 9 = 6

"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

The cost of the subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of the chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of the cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00
The total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Adding the $5.00 tip, the final cost is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate how many questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours and completed 5 questions per hour. So, he completed 8 * 5 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours and completed 5 questions per hour. So, he completed 6 * 5 = 30 questions.

The total number of questions in both tests is 75 + 100 = 175.

The total number of questions Mark completed is 40 + 30 = 70.

Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
- There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's represent the number of queens as 'q'. Then the number of baby bees would be 2q, and the number of worker bees would be 2 * 2q = 4q.

We know the total number of bees is 700. So, the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees is 700.

q + 2q + 4q = 700
Combine like terms:
7q = 700

Now, divide both sides by 7:
q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees:
Number of worker bees = 4q
= 4 * 100
= 400

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year.

First, we find out how many pineapples John can harvest in one harvest season. 
John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. 
So, in one harvest season, John can harvest 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Now, we multiply the number of pineapples harvested in one season by the number of harvests in a year.
1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. The total number of fries eaten so far is 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
5. The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which means 1/3 of the fries were left. Let's call the total number of fries x. Then, the number of fries left after the raccoon is x - 2/3x = 1/3x.
6. We know that the ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the number of fries left after the raccoon is 5 + 1 = 6.
7. Since 1/3x = 6, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get x = 18.

However, this is the number of fries left after Dave ate 14. To find the original number of fries, we need to add the 14 that Dave ate.

The original number of fries is 18 + 14 = 32.

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left, we need to calculate his total expenses and donations.

Zaid's salary is 6000$. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$

Total spent so far: 1500 + 2000 = 3500$

Remaining amount: 6000 - 3500 = 2500$

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$

Remaining amount after donation: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$

He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$: 200 + 700 = 900$

Total remaining amount after all expenses and donations: 1250 - 900 = 350$

Bo has 40 crabs. 
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = 3/4 * Total votes
Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

"To find the number of red roses Sandra ordered, we first need to find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Then the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. 

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. The number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

Since Jan is 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Now, Mark's current age would be 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age would be 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team and then find the difference.

The well-rounded team has 4 members, each running 400 meters in 55 seconds. 
Total time for the well-rounded team = 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team has 4 members with different running times:
- The first runner runs in 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Now, let's find the difference in time between the two teams:
Difference = Total time of less well-rounded team - Total time of well-rounded team
= 222 - 220
= 2 seconds.

However, the question asks how many seconds the faster team will win by. Since the well-rounded team is faster, we need to subtract the total time of the well-rounded team from the total time of the less well-rounded team. But since the well-rounded team is faster, the correct calculation is already done above.

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to consider the numbers 4, 5, and 6 on a six-sided die. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. 

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the even numbers 2, 4, and 6 on a six-sided die. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for the first roll, and the same for the second roll.

Probability of rolling an even number = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5
Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of the two rolls.
Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%

Now, we need to find the difference in the probabilities and express it as a percentage.

Difference in probabilities = 50% - 25% = 25%

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find the total number of apples they picked, we need to find out how many apples Jenna picked and add that to the number of apples her mom picked.

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples Jenna picked (10) to the number of apples her mom picked (20): 10 + 20 = 30.

"To find the number of rats in each cage, we first need to find the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. This will give us the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats. 140 - 50 = 90.

We know that there are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 3 * 6 * x, where x is the number of rats in each cage.

We can set up an equation: 3 * 6 * x = 90. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 18 (3 * 6). x = 90 / 18 = 5.

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards.

Let's say the trader bought x bags of wheat.

The cost price per bag is $20, so the total cost price is 20x.
The transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is 2x.
The total cost is the sum of the cost price and the transportation cost: 20x + 2x = 22x.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total selling price is 30x.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost: 30x - 22x = 8x.

We know the trader made a total profit of $400, so we can set up the equation:
8x = 400

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

"To find the number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the number of trees that die.

Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So, the net gain of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

In 10 years, the total number of trees he plants is 10 * 10 = 100 trees. The total number of trees he chops down is 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

The net gain of trees in 10 years is 100 - 20 = 80 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom has 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

30% of the trees die, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

The number of trees Tom has left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

3. On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 years to each.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 times Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. 
Adrian's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years.
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of 68 is 34, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can add these points to find out how many points they scored in total.

68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points.

Initial number of water type cards: 40
Number of water type cards lost: 8
Number of water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

Initial number of grass type cards: 20
Number of grass type cards bought: 14
Number of grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Total number of cards initially: 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90
Total number of cards now: 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Now, we can find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons that were ready and subtract them from the total.

Initially, 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons.

So, Ashlyn took 36 melons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. 
3/4 of 84 is (3/4) * 84 = 63 melons.

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the weekly amount.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we need to add the amount his girlfriend eats to Steve's amount. If Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, then his girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats.

Girlfriend's weekly amount = 42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Total weekly amount = Steve's amount + Girlfriend's amount
Total weekly amount = 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week
Total weekly amount = 63 tomatoes/week

Now, we know that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total weekly amount by the amount produced by one vine.

Number of vines = Total weekly amount / Amount produced by one vine
Number of vines = 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week

"To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to consider the initial pens and the pens he makes from the empty ones.

Ram starts with 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he can make new pens from the empty ones. Since it takes 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen, we can divide the initial 25 pens by 5 to find out how many new pens he can make from the first set of empty pens.

25 / 5 = 5

So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the initial 25 empty pens. Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

However, the 5 new pens will also run out of ink eventually. Ram can then use those 5 empty pens to make 1 more pen (5 / 5 = 1).

Now, Ram has 30 (previous pens) - 5 (empty pens used to make a new pen) + 1 (new pen) = 26 pens.

The 1 new pen will also run out of ink eventually. Ram can then use that 1 empty pen, but he needs 4 more empty pens to make a new one. Since he doesn't have 4 more empty pens, he can't make another new pen.

So, Ram ends up with 26 pens.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes.

Mike has 5 pen pals initially, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals left.

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives from his pen pals is 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write a page. So, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

"To find the answer, we need to break down the information given.

Chris has 6 trees. 
Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has is 3 * 2 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has: 11 - 3 = 8.

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. 
The total time to warm up the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. 
It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil, so it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and the rosette take.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. To find out how many stitches the sleeves take, we subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, substitute the first equation into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expand the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100
Total spots on all snakes = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Now, we add the team members, coaches, and guests: 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3 to find out the number of pizzas needed: 39 / 3 = 13.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we already have a whole number, so we don't need to round up. Maddy needs 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * 15 = 195.

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

76 (total stars) - 36 (stars in 8-star and 6-star rows) = 40 stars

Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

So, 60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left after the morning.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the weight she loses in 4 weeks and then multiply by 4.

8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4
4 * 4 = 16

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

For the ice cream, the original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we're buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we're buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate his total expenses first.

6 business suits at $100 each will cost 6 * $100 = $600.
3 suitcases at $50 each will cost 3 * $50 = $150.
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500.
So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.
Total expenses so far are $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.
He also wants to save $2000 for the trip.

Total money set aside for the trip is $1950 (expenses) + $2000 (savings) = $3950.
He has $6000 for the trip, so he has $6000 - $3950 = $2050 left to spend on gifts.

"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of players on each team. 

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. 
Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. 
There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:
D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:
7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30."

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

1/4 of the total number of people left, so the number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many pencils Jam has in boxes, we subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total number of pencils she has. 
26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in boxes.

Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, we divide the total number of pencils in boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold.
24 (pencils in boxes) / 3 (boxes) = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have to find out the total number of pencils they have together.
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

To find out how many boxes they need, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold.

Since 7 new records were given out, and each trade is for 1 new record, 7 trades were made.

Since each trade is for 2 old records, we multiply the number of trades by 2 to find the total number of old records.

7 trades * 2 old records per trade = 14 old records

So the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to find the number of junior and senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since there are 100 employees in total, and 40 are junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The salary of junior programmers is $2000 per month. The salary of senior programmers is $400 more than junior programmers, which is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed and then multiply it by the time it takes to charge 1 percentage-point.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can multiply the remaining percentage by 3 minutes to find the total time it will take to fully charge:

40% * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Net income for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

To find the net pay for Job B, we need to calculate the total income, subtract the property tax, and then subtract the income tax.

Now, let's subtract the amount she spent from the total amount she had in the beginning: $36 - $15 = $21.

The amount Andrea saved is $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to first find the total time he spent on the activities mentioned. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 
So, the total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

This was 30% of the time he spent, so to find the total time he spent, we can set up the equation:
15 = 0.3x
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

So, the total time he spent is 50 hours.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so the time spent sightseeing is:
0.4 * 50 = 20

"To find out how much Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much she has earned and add it to her initial savings. 

At her first job, Annabelle earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200. 

At her second job, Annabelle earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

Adding these amounts to her initial savings, Annabelle now has 80 + 200 + 75 = $355.

Since the phone costs $400, Annabelle still needs 400 - 355 = $45.

2. Find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
   The combined height is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

3. Find the height of the tallest tree:
   The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves each day, we need to subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. 
She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of the lollipops is 4 x 25 cents = 100 cents or $1.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 - $1 = $4

So, Marisa saves $4 each day.

To find out how much she saves in 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5:

"To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know Billy bought 40 gumballs at $.05 each. So, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * .05 = $2.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, that means he had $4 in change after buying the candy (because $2 is half of $4).

We know Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The combined distance is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find the number of days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance traveled in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20

There are 52 weeks in a year. Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
52 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 312 days/year

However, the problem states that the builder works 4 weeks every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is:
12 months/year * 4 weeks/month = 48 weeks/year

So, the total number of days he works in a year is:
48 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

The builder's daily wage is $50. Therefore, his total earnings in a year are:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400

"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs 4 times the amount of flour and milk. 

For flour, 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

For milk, 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to find the energy used per day and then the energy used in 30 days. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours per day.

Energy used per day with reduced usage = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

Energy used in 30 days with reduced usage = 2.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 81 kWh.

Now, let's find the original energy usage in 30 days. 
Original energy used per day = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kWh per day.

Original energy used in 30 days = 7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh.

Energy saved in 30 days = Original energy used in 30 days - Energy used in 30 days with reduced usage
= 216 kWh - 81 kWh
= 135 kWh.

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to find the total number of stripes and divide it by the number of zebras.

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
One zebra has 36 stripes.
Another zebra has half of 36, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Total number of stripes = 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
Total number of zebras = 4.

Average number of stripes = Total number of stripes / Total number of zebras = 88 / 4 = 22.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we need 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so we need 5 pounds of each.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

The total cost is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To find the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, which is 60. So, he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, he has 80 (initial corns) + 20 (new corns) = 100 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he took before the jog and subtract that from the total steps he needed to take.

Elliott's goal is 10,000 steps. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. Then he did another 1,000 steps with his friend, so the total steps before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take, so the total steps he took before having 2,000 steps left is 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

Now, to find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the steps he took before the jog from the total steps he took before having 2,000 steps left: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate how long it will take him to read the book and then subtract that time, along with the travel time, from the total time he has.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. So, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate: 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby will need is 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport. To find out how many minutes early he will be, we subtract the total time he needs from the total time he has: 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is $15 * 40 = $600.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $2400 * 40 = $96000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 3/4 * 40 = 30.
The total amount paid to each employee in a week is still $15 * 40 = $600.
The total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.
The total amount paid to all employees in June is $2400 * 30 = $72000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96000 + $72000 = $168000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

For the taffy, Sally bought 2 pounds. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

The total amount Sally spent is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework.

The first package costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
20% of $1200 is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost of the packages: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, add the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the number of candles that are defective in both ways.

First, let's find the number of candles that are 1% likely to explode. Since 99% are guaranteed not to explode, 1% are likely to explode. 
1% of 50000 candles is 0.01 * 50000 = 500 candles.

Next, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that are likely to explode) smell like wet dog. 
5% of 500 candles is 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles.

So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

"To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to break down the information given.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. She gathered half of this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 = 45 apples. The total number of apples gathered by her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, the total number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees can be found by subtracting the total number of apples gathered by both sisters from the tallest and shortest trees from the combined total.

Total apples gathered by both sisters from the tallest and shortest trees = 45 (Joanne) + 105 (sister) = 150 apples.

Now, subtract this from the combined total: 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

However, this 350 apples includes the apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees and the remaining apples gathered by her sister (which is 0 since she didn't gather from the average trees). So, the 350 apples are the apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees.

"Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can say that the total number of animals (camels and dromedaries) is 180. So, c + d = 180.

We also know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can say that 2c + d = 304.

Now we have two equations:
1. c + d = 180
2. 2c + d = 304

We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate 'd'. 
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
This simplifies to c = 124.

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting c into the first equation:
124 + d = 180
d = 180 - 124
d = 56

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 km is:
30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Since this is the total distance for 2 days, we don't need to divide it by 2.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since Bill is signing up for 2 years (24 months), we need to subtract the introductory period (6 months) and the increased rate period (which we'll calculate later) from the total months. Since 2 years is 24 months, and the introductory period is 6 months, that leaves 24 - 6 = 18 months. However, 8 months of that is at the normal rate, so the remaining months at the increased rate is 18 - 8 = 10 months. The cost of the normal rate period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is 10 months at $14 per month, so the cost is:

"To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

The original price of the jogger jeans can be found by adding the savings to the sale price. The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the tattered jeans can be found by adding the savings to the sale price. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans is not correct, it is actually the other way around. The tattered jeans originally cost more than the jogger jeans. 

The difference in the original prices is $32 - $24 = $8.

Kenny spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have had $100 + $50 = $150 in total.

Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the total amount of money he had ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he sold:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3x.

We know that the number of cards he sold is 100, so we can set up the equation:

2/3x = 100

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

When 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed would be 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, there's a shortage of 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest needs one hotdog to have a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the shortage of hotdogs, which is 26."

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to know the length and width of the room. We are given the length of the room in yards, so we need to convert it to feet first. There are 3 feet in a yard, so:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We are also given the area of the room, which is 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. So, she bought 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Elizabeth has 3 * 20 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. So, she bought 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, Margareth has 7 * 20 = 140 beads.

Now, let's find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. To do this, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number: 140 - 60 = 80.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon and James to complete the triathlon.

Jon's total time:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, James' swim time is 90% of Jon's swim time:
- James' swim time: 40 * 0.9 = 36 minutes

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon:
- James' bike ride time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
- James' total time: 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike ride times from his total time:
- James' run time: 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes

1 hour = 60 minutes
1.25 hours = 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:
Movie B = 75 + 5 = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:
Movie A = 80 / 4 = 20 minutes

"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay

The cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30. 

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the money Michael has:
$30 - $24 = $6

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the sneakers and subtract the cost of the sneakers.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 * $20 = $340 from the flash sale.

He sold the rest of the sneakers, which is 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers, to the department store for $25 each. So, he made 31 * $25 = $775 from the department store.

The total amount of money he made is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The salesman's profit is the total amount of money he made minus the cost of the sneakers, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

The regular ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3, so the total cost of the ticket and soda is $12 + $3 = $15.

To find the regular price of popcorn, subtract the cost of the ticket and soda from the total cost of the regular ticket option: $19 - $15 = $4.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. 
Cost = Number of balloons * Price per balloon
Cost = 170 * $65

"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled is:
Distance1 = 60 * 2 = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled is:
Distance2 = 30 * 1 = 30 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 + 30 = 150 miles

Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed first.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips the farmer needs to make: 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats consumed will be 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, Uncle Ben will need 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

"To find the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has, we need to break down the information given.

First, we find the total number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we multiply 27 by 2/3.

27 * 2/3 = 18

So Jana has 18 Pomeranians. 

Now, we find the number of girl Pomeranians. One third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we multiply 18 by 1/3.

18 * 1/3 = 6

"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount, we first need to find out how much more money he needs. 

The toy car costs $12 and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs is $12 - $4 = $8.

Since he saves $2 daily, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take him to save the money. 

$8 / $2 = 4 days

"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the trays, we need to calculate the total number of eggs the trays can hold and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs the trays can hold is 24 * 2 = 48.

Jaime has 64 eggs, so we subtract the number of eggs the trays can hold from the total number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and add it to the cost of the small pizza.

The cost of the small pizza is $8.
The cost of the family-size pizza is 3 times the cost of the small pizza, so it's 3 * $8 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of both pizzas:
$8 (small pizza) + $24 (family-size pizza) = $32

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after the discount and then divide it by the total number of razors.

Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but due to the buy one get one free sale, she only pays for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors to find the cost per razor: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The middle level has 3 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 3 * 64"" = 192"". 
The top level has 2 girls, each 64"" tall, so their total height is 2 * 64"" = 128"". 
The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 636"" / 12 = 53 feet.

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first find out how old Angela will be in four years. Since in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, and Brett is 14 years old now, we multiply 14 by 3.

14 * 3 = 42

This means in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 from 42.

42 - 4 = 38

So Angela is 38 years old now, but the question asks for her current age, and Brett is 14 now, so we need to subtract the 4 years that will pass from Angela's age in 4 years and also subtract the 4 years that will pass from Brett's age, so we subtract 4 from 38 and also subtract 4 from 14 and then subtract the result from 38 - 4.

3. David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Then David found x/2 insects, and Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + (x/2 + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:

x + x/2 + x/2 = 43 - 7
x + x = 36
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now we know Bodhi found 18 insects. David found half of that, which is 18/2 = 9. Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 9 + 7 = 16.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

- The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To find out how many days Andy has to reach his goal, we need to calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th. 

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to the end of December is 1 day. 
January, February, March, April, May, and June have 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, and 30 days respectively. 
July has 31 days, and since Andy's birthday is on July 19th, we count 19 days in July. 

Total days = 1 (Dec) + 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 19 (Jul) = 201 days.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs and needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs a total calorie deficit of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 105,000 / 201 ≈ 522 calories.

"To find the cost of the house, let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

1/3 of 27 cups is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. 

Since a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we can divide 9 by 3/4 to find the number of batches.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh):
Daily consumption before: 12 kWh/h * 24 h = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after: 14 kWh/h * 24 h = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
Weekly consumption before: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so we multiply the weekly consumption by the cost:
Weekly cost before: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly cost after: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Total sofas = 20 (Ophelia) + 64 (Jenna) = 84

On the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

Now, the total number of passengers is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Since Jame will be 27 in 5 years, in 8 years, Jame will be 27 + 3 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than this, so Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we can find the difference in their current ages: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We also know the cost of the computer and the printer. So, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of 2 monitors.

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of computer + Cost of printer)
= $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

Let's assume Elvis saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x dollars each day in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. The total savings should be equal to his target of $1125.

Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half

Total bottles needed = 70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

He already has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each. 
Total bottles he already has = 2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Now, we subtract the total bottles he already has from the total bottles he needs.
Additional bottles needed = Total bottles needed - Total bottles he already has
Additional bottles needed = 140 bottles - 48 bottles
Additional bottles needed = 92 bottles

"To find out how long Ray takes to swim a mile in warm water, we need to calculate twice the time it takes him to swim in cold water and add 2 minutes. 

Twice the time in cold water is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 
Adding 2 minutes to this gives 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so 3 miles will take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so 3 miles will take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate how much he earns per week and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"To find the total number of holes, we need to find the number of buttons with 2 holes and the number of buttons with 4 holes. 

We know that 7 buttons had 2 holes. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total, the number of buttons with 4 holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons to find the total number of holes in the bag. 
Total holes = 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we can find the size of Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 1/4
Peter's locker size = 12 * 0.25

Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, and the daily recommended cups of coffee is 4, Octavia drinks 4 / 2 = 2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 2 * 10 = 20 cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the daily recommended cups from the amount he currently drinks: 20 - 4 = 16.

James has 2 sons, one is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James will need 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

Now, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes.
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes = 70 intervals

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she can read 2 pages per interval.
70 intervals * 2 pages/interval = 140 pages

In the second week, Judy read 100 pages.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's call the nephew's age in 7 years 'x'. Then, we can write the equation: 51 = 3x.

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 51 / 3 = 17.

Since 'x' is the nephew's age in 7 years, to find his current age, we subtract 7 from 'x': 17 - 7 = 10.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for 7 days. So, he can spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, he can buy $10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day for 4 days. That's 2 * 4 = 8 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, he can buy $10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day for 3 days. That's 5 * 3 = 15 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures.

Percentage off: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees, given that it's off by 4%.

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then, the actual temperature will be x + 4% of x.

Actual temperature = x + (4/100)x
Actual temperature = x + 0.04x
Actual temperature = 1.04x

We know the actual temperature should be 520 degrees. So, we can set up the equation:

So, 200 grams of mushrooms has 6 grams of protein. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he gets 6 grams of protein per day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per week, we multiply the amount of protein he gets per day by 7.

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3(30) = 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

1 quarter = 25 cents
8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents

1 dime = 10 cents
6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents

1 nickel = 5 cents
14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents

1 penny = 1 cent
15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 / 5 = 69

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs, so the total number of legs for dogs is 5 * 4 = 20.
Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats, so the total number of legs for cats is 2 * 4 = 8.
Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds, so the total number of legs for birds is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, let's add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

"To find the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to calculate the weight after the 50% increase and then subtract 2 pounds.

First, we calculate the 50% increase: 8 pounds * 0.5 = 4 pounds
Then, we add the increase to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds
Finally, we subtract 2 pounds: 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he bought each year and add the games he received for his birthday and Christmas.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also got 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also got 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 22 + 29 = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also got 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 51 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time 
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours 
Rate = 400 miles per hour 

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate. 

Time = Distance / Rate 
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour 
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour, we need to divide the total pounds of chocolates he makes in 2 hours by 2. 
Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 
Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, Marissa makes (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds in an hour.

Now, we know Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour and Marissa makes 90 pounds in an hour. 
In 12 hours, Ruiz will make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds and Marissa will make 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 1080 = 1800.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate how much he spent in total.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

Now, let's add up the total amount he spent: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned in the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours, then add them together.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
So, in 4 hours, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups of lemonade.
The total amount of money he earned in the first 4 hours is 60 * $0.50 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
So, in 2 hours, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups of lemonade.
The total amount of money he earned in the next 2 hours is 20 * $0.60 = $12.

The total amount of money Patrick earned in 6 hours is $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find out how many rotations the tires undergo in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per 2 miles, then multiply by 2 (since the given rotations are for 2 miles).

Rotations per month = (400 miles/month) * (725 rotations / 2 miles) * 2 
Rotations per month = 400 * 725 * 0.5 
Rotations per month = 145,000

To find out how many months the tire can last, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per month.

Months the tire can last = 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month 
Months the tire can last = 72 months

To find out how many years the tire can last, we need to divide the number of months by 12.

Years the tire can last = 72 months / 12 months/year 
Years the tire can last = 6 years

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can find the total number of pumps by multiplying 120 by 2, but that is the number of washings for 2 pumps, so we just need to multiply 120 by 1/2 to get the number of washings for 1 pump. 120 * 1/2 = 60.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the discount and subtract it from the $50 he has.

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
30% of $60 is 0.3 x $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final price: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add anything else. Now, we subtract the final price from the $50 Joe has: $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we need to calculate the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week and then multiply that by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will make 4 * 7 = 28 dozen croissants in a week.

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, to make 28 dozen croissants, Juan will need 28 * 1/4 = 28 * 0.25 = 7 pounds of butter.

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial funding, which is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month. 50% more than that is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat eaten by the three players: 
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used and multiply it by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

He then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find 10% of that profit.

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars. 
30% of $25,000 is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500. 
So, the cost price of each car is $7,500.

The profit from each car is the selling price minus the cost price: 
$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. 
10% of $175,000 is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25.

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

The price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. 
So, the price of the silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200.

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800.

Price of the more expensive brand = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.
Cost of coffee = 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is:
$42 + $2 = $44

"To find the total time the math teachers spend sleeping, we first need to find the number of math teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, the remaining 40% are math teachers.

Number of history teachers = 60% of 150 = 0.6 * 150 = 90
Number of math teachers = 150 - 90 = 60

Now, we know that each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. So, the total time the math teachers spend sleeping is:
Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
Total time = 60 * 6

Now, we need to find the difference between the desired height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

Initially, James had 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means the number of dogs doubled. So, the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.

Karen's hourly wage = 2 * $10
Karen's hourly wage = $20

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days if she works 3 hours per day. We can calculate her total earnings as follows:

Total hours worked in 2 days = 2 days * 3 hours/day

"Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation: T = t + 7.

We know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the total number of people is 5. The combined ages of the twins are 2T, and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44. Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get: 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin using the first equation: T = t + 7. Substituting t = 6, we get: T = 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to first calculate the total bill.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation:
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:

5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

Now, we add the number of regular chairs and high chairs to get the total number of chairs Mia's restaurant has.
40 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 48 chairs.

We know that 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function. Since babies will use high chairs, we subtract the number of babies from the total number of high chairs to see if there are enough high chairs for the babies.

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the quarts made per hour for each flavor and then multiply by 48.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. So, the quarts made per hour is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. So, the quarts made per hour is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total quarts made in 48 hours for each flavor:
- Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
- Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

The total quarts made in 48 hours is 2400 + 600 = 3000.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for both feet when her arms are raised and when they are not.

When her arms are at her sides, her right foot taps 300 times per minute and her left foot taps 250 times per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms at her sides, the total taps in 3 minutes is 550 * 3 = 1650 taps.

When her arms are raised, both feet tap 200 times per minute. So, the combined taps per minute is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised, the total taps in 2 minutes is 400 * 2 = 800 taps.

The combined total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450.

There are 5 pizzas in total (Bryce and 4 friends). Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 2/3 of 3 pizzas. 2/3 of 3 pizzas is 2 pizzas. 2 pizzas have 2 x 12 = 24 slices.

The 2 remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate ¾ of 2 pizzas. ¾ of 2 pizzas is 1.5 pizzas. 1.5 pizzas have 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices.

"To find the average time, we need to first find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages. 

Since the dog eats the sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes, we multiply the cat's time by 2/3. 
The cat takes 30 minutes, so the dog takes 2/3 * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we have the time taken by the cat (30 minutes) and the dog (20 minutes). 
To find the average time, we add the two times and divide by 2. 
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

"To find the length of Bobby's shoe, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 
Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe 'x'. 

We can write an equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of Bobby's shoe is 10 inches.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

She still has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She still has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has. She has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the rest of her large stickers.

Since a large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 9 large buttons are worth 9 * 3 = 27 small buttons, and 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, she has 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 small buttons.

The answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of matches Joey played, we need to add the matches played on each day.

On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add the matches played on each day:

"Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of votes is equal to the number of people on the council, which is 33. Since each person can only vote once, the total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since x is the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x, which is 2(11) = 22.

- Large: Half as many as medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students
- Extra-large: Six more than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size to find the total number of shirts ordered.

The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
60% of 40 is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply the number of Pomeranian girls by 3.

6 Pomeranian girls * 3 = 18 Pomeranians

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up a proportion. Let x be the total number of puppies.

(2/3)x = 18

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2.

x = 18 * (3/2)
x = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total cases of shingles needed: 250
- The first house needs 1/2 of the second house.
- The third house needs double the first house.

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the second house as 'x'. Then the first house needs x/2.

Since the third house needs double the first house, it needs 2 * (x/2) = x.

Now, the total number of cases is the sum of the cases needed for each house: x/2 + x + x = 250.

Combine like terms: 2.5x = 250.

Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 100.

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases, the first house needs 100/2 = 50 cases.

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * 50 = 100 cases.

Time remaining after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Time remaining after reading - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent playing soccer:

Distance driven = driving speed * driving time
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance driven = 225 miles

The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. 
Half the driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Distance hiked = hiking speed * hiking time

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 
Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is x. 
The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:
x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:
x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:
x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:
0.7x = 4.2

Finally, we can divide both sides by 0.7:
x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
She plays for half an hour (0.5 hours) each day, so in 14 days, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week (7 days). So, in 7 days, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

The total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours. Since she has already played 21 hours, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to find the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

The pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
The pass rate of the fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders, so it is 2 * 40% = 80%.
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

The total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.
The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first find out how many square inches he can cover with the glass chips he has.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips. So, he has a total of 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, the total number of square inches he can cover is 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, the length of the mosaic can be found by dividing the total square inches by the height. 

So, the length of the mosaic is 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to first find out how many quarts of tea were consumed. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so they drank 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts of tea. 
16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so they drank 16 * 2 = 32 quarts of tea. 

Total quarts of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

Now, we add the remaining quarts of tea to the total quarts of tea consumed to find the initial amount of tea. 
10 (remaining) + 38 (consumed) = 48 quarts of tea.

First, we need to find out how many minutes they play. 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. So, in 240 minutes, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. So, in 240 minutes, they will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two friends, they will use 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. So, in 240 minutes, he will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, we add up all the quarters used: 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's represent the amount of zest as 'x'. Then the amount of fragrance is also 'x'. 
Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of salt is 2x. 
The amount of sugar is the same as salt, so it's also 2x. 
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

Now, let's add up the amounts of all the ingredients: 
x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the total original length minus the total used length. 
3 * 12 mm = 36 mm (total original length)
36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes. Since he collected twice as many dishes as socks, he must have collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
   Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
   Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

5. Total number of socks and dishes together = Total socks + Total dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

55 - 10 = 45

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. 
So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:

- I am three years younger than my brother.
- I am 2 years older than my sister.
- My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
- When you add all our ages, you get 87.

Let's use variables to represent the ages:
- My age: A
- Brother's age: B
- Sister's age: S
- Mom's age: M

From the given information:
1. A = B - 3
2. A = S + 2
3. M = 3B - 1
4. A + B + S + M = 87

We can express B and S in terms of A:
- B = A + 3
- S = A - 2

Now, we can express M in terms of A:
- M = 3(A + 3) - 1
- M = 3A + 9 - 1
- M = 3A + 8

Now, substitute B, S, and M in terms of A into the equation A + B + S + M = 87:
- A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3A + 8) = 87
- A + A + 3 + A - 2 + 3A + 8 = 87

"To find the number of microphones that won't fit, we need to calculate 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

This means 10 microphones won't fit. The remaining microphones that will be arranged in pairs are 50 - 10 = 40.

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, we need to divide the number of microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to find the speed of the thingamabob first. 

Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Speed of whatchamacallit = 121 meters per second
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second

Now, since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5 to find the speed of the whirligig.

Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5 = 55 meters per second

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first find out how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, and assuming the pay is per mowing, she mowed Joe's lawn once. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she made from mowing lawns. 
- Joe's lawn: $6
- Kamala's lawn: 3 * $6 = $18
- Alba's lawn: 5 * $6 = $30

Total amount from mowing lawns: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Now, we know that Tasha made a total of $80. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount.

$80 - $54 = $26

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 
1/5 of 50 miles is 50 / 5 = 10 miles. 
So Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today. 
Daniel's total pages = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equal to 2 child bowls, we can convert 2 adult bowls to 4 child bowls. So, the total number of bowls eaten is 4 child bowls + 2 child bowls = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, the leftover soup will be divided between them. Each child will get 2 child bowls / 2 children = 1 child bowl.

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup 1 time.

For small masks: 
Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
To make 20 small masks, she will need 20 / 4 = 5 times the material needed for 4 masks. 
So, she will need 5 * 2 = 10 yards of material for 20 small masks.

For large masks: 
Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, she will need 8 / 3 = 2.67 times the material needed for 3 masks. 
So, she will need 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards of material for 8 large masks.

Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Adam's current age be x.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was 60 - 8 = 52.
Four years ago, Adam's age was x - 4.

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So we can set up the equation:

52 = 2(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2x - 8
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x
x = 30

So Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

We also know that L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so P + L + J = 100

Substituting L = J + 10 into P = L + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substituting P = 2J + 10 and L = J + 10 into P + L + J = 100, we get
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

In 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month:
Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets * $6 = $259200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets * $6 = $194400

The difference in the amount of money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000 is:
$259200 - $194400 = $64800

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
The cost for a 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos. 
Cameron stayed for 17 hours, so he needs to pay for 5 additional hours (17 - 12 = 5). 
The cost for the additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the second option from the cost of the first option:
1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find the amount of hay needed, we first need to determine how much each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount for each sheep as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * (goat's hay) - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 goats * 5 pounds
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = 12 sheep * 7 pounds
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

"To find out how many pens John can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 * 6 = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars left

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars left

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends:
5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now he has:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars left

He wants to buy 25 dollar pens, so we divide the remaining money by the cost of a pen:
100 / 25 = 4

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we need to calculate the total number of bottles she gets from the coupons and subtract the number of bottles she gives to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

The teacher gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gives away is:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles she gives away from the total number of bottles she gets:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we round up to the nearest hour, which is 3 hours. 

Labor cost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, we add the labor cost to the visit charge and the cost of parts:

Total cost = Visit charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total cost = $40 + $105 + $60

The total cost of the CDs is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got a 40% discount, the amount he saved is 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got back $40.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid: $90 - $40 = $50.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find Leo's age, we need to first find Marcus' age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, we can subtract 5 from Deanna's age to find Marcus' age.

Marcus' age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus' age = 26 - 5
Marcus' age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, we can multiply Marcus' age by 2 to find Leo's age.

Leo's age = 2 * Marcus' age
Leo's age = 2 * 21
Leo's age = 42

"Let's break down the information given:

- Bahati scored the most points.
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D.

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10.

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can set A + 20 = D + 10.

We also know that A + B + D = 45 (the total points).

Now, we can express B in terms of A and substitute it into the total points equation.

B = A + 20
D = B - 10 = (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10

Now, substitute B and D in terms of A into the total points equation:
A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
3A + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3A = 15

Divide by 3:
A = 5

So Azibo scored 5 points.

Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads she received from each person:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90

"To find the total number of servings, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players.
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players.
30 - 6 = 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early.
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to find Charlie's shoe size first. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we multiply Sophie's size by 5.

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we find the average by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2.

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space each plant takes up is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space each plant takes up.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. However, Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so we multiply the number of flowers Pat needs to buy by the cost per flower.

27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
Edgar's brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 18 * 0.5 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines for each basket, then multiply by the number of baskets.

Each basket has 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so the cost of petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
Each basket has 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so the cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.
Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost is 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the soil used from the total amount of soil to find out how much is left for the roses.

30 pounds (total) - 27 pounds (used) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant:

3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside each month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck. 
25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00 per month.

Since she sets aside $500.00 per month, in a year she will have:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of shoes she can buy in a year is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To find the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time it takes her to peel the shrimp and the time it takes her to cook the shrimp.

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To saute 90 shrimp, it will take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

The total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on low is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on high is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up for 2 hours at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet the second time, and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

3. Church: 2 checks per month, so 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter, so 1 * 4 = 4 checks per year.

"To find the number of flights the first plane makes, we need to find out how many flights the second plane makes and then multiply it by 2. 

The second plane makes 44 trips, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it goes to Greece 88 * 3/4 = 66 times.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22.

Since the flights are split equally, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to first find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We already know the ages of Akbar (3) and Alessandro (4). 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

Average age = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute it back into the equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

Walter's friend also donated $200, but this amount is not included in the total that the lawyer will match. 

The lawyer will donate three times as much as the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. So the lawyer's donation will be 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the total number of slices and the size of each slice.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

There are 4 kids and 2 adults, so the total number of slices is 4x (for the kids) + 2(2x) (for the adults) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

Since the total number of slices is 8x, we can set up an equation to represent the total watermelon: 8x = 1 (whole watermelon).

Now, we can find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets by dividing the size of each adult's slice (2x) by the total watermelon (8x) and multiplying by 100:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, then subtract that from the total time he spends at the clinic.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we subtract the total time from the serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."

The cost per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students, so the total cost per session for the students is:
$1.50 per student * 10 students = $15 per session

The total cost per session for the students for 3 days a week is:
$15 per session * 3 sessions per week = $45 per week

The total earnings per week is the sum of the cost to rent the studio and the cost for the students:
$75 per week + $45 per week = $120 per week

"To find the initial charge of the power bank, we need to work backwards. 

First, let's calculate the charge lost in the last 3 hours when the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. 

Since the charge remaining was 28% after 3 hours, we can set up an equation to find the charge before the last 3 hours:

Let x be the charge before the last 3 hours.
x - 3 * 0.07x = 0.28
x - 0.21x = 0.28

40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we subtract the number of easy questions from the total number of questions to find the rest.
60 - 24 = 36 questions.

These 36 questions are equally divided as average and difficult, so we divide by 2.
36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions Aries is sure to get correctly.
She is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correctly.
75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions.

She is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correctly.
Half of 18 average questions = 18 / 2 = 9 average questions.
Half of 18 difficult questions = 18 / 2 = 9 difficult questions.

Now, let's add up the number of questions she is sure to get correctly.
18 easy + 9 average + 9 difficult = 36 questions.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
- Large stuffed animals cost three times the price of small ones, so they cost 3 * $4 = $12 each.
- Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals, then she sold 2x small stuffed animals.
- She earned $120 from the sales.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from the sales of large and small stuffed animals:

Earnings from large stuffed animals: $12 * x
Earnings from small stuffed animals: $4 * 2x

Total earnings: $12x + $8x = $20x

Since she earned $120, we can set up the equation:

$20x = $120

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 20:

x = $120 / $20
x = 6

This means she sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine in a day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
One dwarf can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
One dwarf can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 pounds per day. To find out how much 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40.
36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, we multiply 1440 by 30.
1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for the first two packages and then apply it to the third package.

For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.

For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package will also be $1.50. 

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to find out how much he still owes after selling his old bedroom set.

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000. 
He sells his old bedroom set for $1000, so he uses that to pay for part of the new set.
The amount he still owes is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

He then has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set. 
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 
15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 34 balloons.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

1. There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.
3. If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework:
50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher with extension) + 6% (normal teacher without extension but with personal extension) = 76%

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

Seats for faculty: 300
Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Seats left for friends and family: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. However, the number of graduates is not given. Since 950 seats are reserved for graduates, we can assume that there are 950 graduates.

Tickets per graduate: 4750 / 950 = 5

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and he can eat 75 large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3 to find the number of small beans. 

So, 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

"To find out how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn.

The total amount of loans Jim took is $50,000 per year for 4 years, which is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

The amount of money Jim lost from not working while in school is the amount he would have earned in 4 years at his previous job:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is:
$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income, we divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

The width of the fabric will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to find the area of one piece and multiply it by 2. 

The area of one piece of fabric is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Total amount lost = $5 (first race) - $11 (second race, since he won) + $16.50 (third race) = $10.50.

Since he had a win in one of the races, we still consider it as one of the races when calculating the average.

x + (x + 4) + x/2 = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls in the second set), we can find the number of balls in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

"To find John's average score, we need to add up all his scores and divide by the number of tests.

John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total score for those tests is 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. 
He scored 80 on his 4th test, so the total score for all 4 tests is 300 + 80 = 380.

There are 4 tests in total. To find the average, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 pizzas is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.
So, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.
So, the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

In total, there are 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas left.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

The number of small coupons is 700. Since each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, the total cost of mailing the small coupons is:
700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars

The number of big coupons is twice the number of small coupons, so it's 2 * 700 = 1400. Since each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, the total cost of mailing the big coupons is:
1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost:
35 + 210 = 245 dollars

"To find the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.

Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 + 3 = 6.

The total number of meatballs in 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to first find out how many trucks were able to deliver the fertiliser. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we need to find a quarter of 20 trucks. 
A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser. 
The number of trucks that were able to deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the total number of guests and then determine the additional cost beyond the initial 20 guests.

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. So, the total number of people invited is:
25 + 7 + 13 = 45

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is:
45 - 4 = 41

Since the fee is for a party of 20, and there are 21 additional guests (41 - 20 = 21), we need to calculate the cost for these extra guests:
21 * $6 = $126

Now, we add the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost:
$125 + $126 = $251

"Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. 
1/4 of $60 is $60 * 1/4 = $15. 
So Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 of $60 is $60 * 1/3 = $20. 
So Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

The total amount of money they have left is $45 + $40 = $85.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first find out the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to find the number of bananas eaten in a day:
315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is:
10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.

Now, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten in a day to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats:
45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and the change she gets.

Since Jenny bought 15 roses, we can calculate the cost as follows: 
- A dozen roses (12) cost $15.
- The remaining 3 roses cost $2 each, so 3 x $2 = $6.
- The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny paid with 5 $5 bills, which is 5 x $5 = $25.

The change she gets is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the change is given in quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, we can calculate the number of quarters as follows:
$4 / $0.25 = 16

"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, the second train arrives in 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, the third train arrives in 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves in 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, the fourth train arrives in 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she already has. 

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the price at which the friend bought the watch and compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll calculate the discount amount and then find the percentage:
Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by friend
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount amount / Original price) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his speed.

The distance from home to the store is 4 miles. Since James walked halfway and then back home, the distance he walked before returning home is 4 / 2 = 2 miles. Then he walked 2 miles back home. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store.

So, the total distance James walked is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, the total time it took him to reach the store is 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and the cost of buying them in bunches, then subtract the two amounts.

First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny bought. She bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, so she bought 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so 40 bananas would cost 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, so 10 bunches would cost 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, let's subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually to find out how much money Jenny saved: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"To find out how much fence Sam gets, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, we have:
300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, we have:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes * $250 (half the price of an MTB) = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500

"To find the total hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

To find the extra learning time, we need to calculate 1/16 of his weekly minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. John spends 1/16 of this time on extra learning, which is 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes per week.

However, this is the total for both Saturday and Sunday, so we need to divide this by 2 to get the minutes per day for Saturday and Sunday, which is 630 / 2 = 315 minutes per day for Saturday and Sunday.  But the question asks for the total time per week, so we use 630 minutes.

Now, we add the class time and extra learning time to get the total minutes per week: 1600 + 630 = 2230 minutes per week.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 2230 / 60 = 37.17 hours per week.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then divide it by the area covered by one gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. 
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

So, Billy takes 10 days off and works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Since she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, she needs to save a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

To calculate how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each year: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement, not the number of additional years she needs to work. Since the problem doesn't specify how many years she has already worked, we will assume she just started working.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the total number of cuts.

First, we divide the ribbon into 4 equal parts: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part.

Then, we divide each of these parts into 5 equal parts: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine what 100% of the population is, given that 40% is 240 boys. 

First, we'll find 1% of the population by dividing 240 by 40. 
240 / 40 = 6

Now, we'll multiply 6 by 100 to find 100% of the population.
6 * 100 = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 240 are boys, we subtract 240 from 600 to find the number of girls.
600 - 240 = 360

"To find the average height of heels, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and divide by the number of women.

Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we first need to find out how many days she has to complete her journey. Since she will be on vacation for the entire month of June, let's assume June has 30 days.

Total miles to be hiked = 9,300 miles
Total days available = 30 days

Miles to be hiked per day = Total miles / Total days
= 9,300 miles / 30 days
= 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her current plan is to hike 2 * 125 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her current plan from the required miles per day:
= 310 miles per day - 250 miles per day
= 60 miles per day

However, since she hikes twice a day, we need to divide this by 2 to find out how many more miles per hike she needs to cover:
= 60 miles per day / 2
= 30 miles per hike

Since the question asks for miles per day, we can also say she needs to hike 30 more miles per hike, which is 60 miles per day in total, but the question asks for ""miles per day"" that she must hike, so we can say she needs to hike 60 miles more per day, or 30 miles more per hike, but the question is asking for miles per day, so the answer is 60 miles per day.

"To find out how many kilograms James will have left, we first need to determine how many kilograms Pierre, Paul, and Jacques will have left after Peter and Paul take their share. However, the question seems to be referring to Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, but then mentions Peter and James. Assuming the question meant Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, and then Peter and Jacques, we can proceed.

Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. 
Peter wants a quarter of that, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.
Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The total amount taken is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.
So, the amount left is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.

After buying the books, she had $2 left. So, she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent on the books by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 / 2 = $5

255 / 5 = 51

So, the light blinks 51 times per minute. 

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing 459 by 51.

459 / 51 = 9

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

Tate bought: 
Male fishes: 2 (guppies) + 2 (goldfishes) = 4
Female fishes: 1 (guppy) + 3 (goldfishes) = 4

Total male fishes: 7 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 11
Total female fishes: 12 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes:

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to find out how many toys the first 4 workers produce in total.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so 2 x 6 = 12 toys per hour.
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so 2 x 4 = 8 toys per hour.
Total toys produced by 4 workers per hour = 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers = 20 x 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total and still needs 20 more toys after the 4 workers have worked for 10 hours. So, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers = 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the 4 workers = 200 toys.
So, the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker = 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour = 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs: 
Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. 
21 - 13 = 8

The total weight is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's say her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that time = distance / speed. So, the time she spends on the beach is 2 miles / x miles per minute = 2/x minutes. We are given that this time is 40 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

2/x = 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x:

2 = 40x

Now, divide both sides by 40:

x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

2x = 2(1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time she spends on the sidewalk:

time = distance / speed = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute) = 10 minutes

Finally, we can find the total time it takes for her to complete the walk by adding the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk:

total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

So, the total cost of 4 packs of bagels with the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

So, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is 26 / 2 = 13.

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day.

He buys 20 rocks and sells them for $7 each, but only sells 60% of his inventory. To find out how many rocks he sells, we multiply the total number of rocks by 60% (or 0.6):
20 rocks * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Now, we calculate his total revenue by multiplying the number of rocks he sells by the selling price:
12 rocks * $7 = $84

His total cost is the amount he spent on buying the rocks:

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since Lauren can only work on one type of scene per day, we need to add the days for each type of scene. However, this would be incorrect as it assumes she works on one type of scene exclusively until it's done. A better approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days for each type of scene or to find a combination that works.

A combination that works is: 
- 7 days for small scenes (49/7 = 7)
- 6 days for medium scenes (36/6 = 6)
- 9 days for large scenes (45/5 = 9)

However, she can't work on all three at the same time. A combination that works is to do the 7 days of small scenes and 6 days of medium scenes first (13 days total), then do the large scenes. 

9 days for large scenes + 6 days for medium scenes is not the best combination since she can do the 7 days of small scenes at the same time as the 6 days of medium scenes.

9 days for large scenes + 7 days for small scenes is not the best combination since she can do the 6 days of medium scenes at the same time as the 7 days of small scenes.

The best combination is 7 days for small scenes and 6 days for medium scenes (13 days total), then do the large scenes. 
9 days for large scenes + 6 days for medium scenes is 15 days total, but she can do the 7 days of small scenes at the same time as the 6 days of medium scenes and 2 days of large scenes. 
So the 7 days of small scenes and 6 days of medium scenes can be done in 7 days and the 9 days of large scenes can be done in 9 days, but 2 of those days are already used, so 7 + (9 - 2) = 7 + 7 = 14.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food in May, we need to know how many days are in May. May has 31 days.

Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food per day. So, the total cost of food per day is 3 * $1 = $3.

Since May has 31 days, the total cost of food for the month is $3 * 31 = $93.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to find the probability of each ticket winning and then multiply them together.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning:
20% * 60% = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to find out the total number of seashells they collected. 

First, we know Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. So, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, we can find the total number of seashells they collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally between themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends, then add them together.

There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and Mason eats 4 carrots each day, so:
5 weekdays * 4 carrots = 20 carrots

There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and Mason eats 5 carrots each day, so:
2 weekend days * 5 carrots = 10 carrots

Now, let's add the total carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. 
The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 
To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6, which is 3 minutes. 
So the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of the two songs: 
5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so he bought a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices.

The cost of each device is $20, so the total cost is 6 x $20 = $120.

He sells each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

The total selling price is 6 x $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

Isabel is 7 feet tall. 
Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.

"To determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed for one person. 

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles per person.

For 2300 people, we need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to reach 11500 bottles. 

11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then the number of babies wearing bows.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies wear purple.
1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies wear blue.

All the blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
There are 2 babies wearing purple bows out of 4 babies wearing bows. 
The percentage chance is (2/4) * 100% = 50%.

Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out. He goes out 3 times a day, so he changes his face mask 2 * 3 = 6 times a day.

Since he changes his face mask 6 times a day, he uses 6 face masks a day. To find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to first find out how many eggs were hidden initially and then subtract the number of eggs found by the kids.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs each kid found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by the kids: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find 60% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0.6, which is 240. So the last apartment complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, John collects garbage from 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

He collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment and gets paid $.40 per collection. So, the total amount he makes in a week is 1040 * 3 * 0.40 = 1248.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope.
- The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
- The combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B. Then the length of the red rope is 4B, and the length of the yellow rope is B + 7.

The combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:
B = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope length = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. Then Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint that is not yellow. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is the combination of red, white, and purple. 

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Half of that is 12 / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint. The remaining half is also 6 pints, which is the total amount of red, white, and purple paint.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

6 / 3 = 2

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we can find out how many pods we get per dollar by dividing the number of pods by the cost. 
120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since we use 1 pod per cycle, we can run 10 cycles per dollar."
"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
   Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home.
   The number of 20 dollar bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   Half of 40 is 40 / 2 = 20. 
   The number of 20 dollar bills remaining is 40 - 20 = 20.

4. Thomas then triples his money.
   Since he has 20 * 20 = $400, tripling it will be 400 * 3 = $1200.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find 20% of the original 5 inches, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch.

Now, we divide the remaining chalk (2.75 inches) by the amount used each day (1 inch), but we also need to consider that the teacher cannot use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. 

2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days. Since the teacher can't use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to get to 2 inches. 

2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches left to use after 2 days. 
0.75 / 1 = 0.75 days, but since the teacher can't use the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we round down to 2 days and then add 1 more day for the remaining 0.75 inch is not enough to last a full day but the teacher can use it for that day.

So the teacher has 2 + 1 = 3 days before he has to recycle this piece.

Let Wendy's current age be W and Colin's current age be C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate how many snowballs he builds per minute: 
20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the melting rate per minute, we divide 2 by 15:

Now, we can calculate the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs per minute by subtracting the melting rate from the building rate:
1/3 - 2/15 = (5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can calculate the time it will take by dividing the number of snowballs needed by the net rate:

"To find out how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned from each task and then add them together.

- Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each, so he earned 6 * $0.50 = $3.00 from emptying the dishwasher.
- Jason did his laundry once at $3.00, so he earned $3.00 from doing his laundry.
- Jason took the trash out twice at $0.75 each, so he earned 2 * $0.75 = $1.50 from taking the trash out.
- Jason cleaned his room once at $1.50, so he earned $1.50 from cleaning his room.

Now, let's add the total amount he earned from each task: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

"To find the cost of the scotch per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles. 
Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost of scotch / Number of bottles of scotch
Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10
Cost per bottle of scotch = $60

Since the bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5.
Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch * 1.5
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 * 1.5
Cost per bottle of cognac = $90

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost per bottle of cognac
Total cost of cognac = 20 * $90
Total cost of cognac = $1800

Total cost of everything = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
Total cost of everything = $600 + $1800

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more trees. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:

Day 1: 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees
Day 2: 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40."" We can represent this as an equation:

4x + 8 = 40

where x is the number of coffee mugs.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

To find the number of fish with blue stripes, we need to calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
Number of fish with blue stripes = 5/11 * 44
Number of fish with blue stripes = 20

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The pasta costs $1.00 per box. 
The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
The gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of cheddar cheese, so it's 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 
So, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

"To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning and divide it by the total time available.

The custodian has 5 days to clean 80 classrooms. 
Time spent per classroom = 15 minutes
Total time spent cleaning = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 
Total time spent cleaning in hours = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day for 5 days, so 
Total time available = 8 hours * 5 days = 40 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms:
Percentage = (Total time spent cleaning / Total time available) * 100
= (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the total number of books one bookcase can hold. 

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the number of books one bookcase can hold: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold: 110 / 55 = 2.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue from selling them.

Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. 
The cost of the eggs is 5 dozens x $2.40 per dozen = $12.

She will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so she will sell 60 eggs / 3 = 20 sets of eggs for $1 each. 
Her total revenue will be 20 sets x $1 per set = $20.

Her profit will be the total revenue minus the total cost: $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. So the sale price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost per stick by dividing the sale price by the number of sticks: $15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar): $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. Then, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

So, the number of strawberry cubes is 20. Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother and add it to the ages of the other siblings.

The younger brother is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. So, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

The three sisters are 16 years old each, so their total age is 3 * 16 = 48 years.

The total age of all the siblings is 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) + 48 (sisters) = 84 years.

"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on meditation and yoga separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates 15 minutes twice a day, so she meditates 15 * 2 = 30 minutes per day. In 4 weeks, there are 28 days (since 4 * 7 = 28). So, the total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks is 30 * 28 = 840 minutes.

Charisma practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks, she practices yoga 5 * 4 = 20 times. The total time spent on yoga is 20 * 60 = 1200 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Now, we add the time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to find out how many seeds a small sunflower and a large sunflower have.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. 50% of 36 is 0.5 * 36 = 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds of the small and large sunflower to get the total number of seeds. 
36 (small sunflower) + 54 (large sunflower) = 90 seeds.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, then add them together.

For the T-shirts, since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt ($8) and 50% off for the second T-shirt. 
The price of the second T-shirt is 50% off, so it's $8 * 0.5 = $4. 
The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and it's 40% off. 
The discount is 40% of $40, which is $40 * 0.4 = $16. 
The price Jake pays for the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends is the cost of the T-shirts plus the cost of the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day and the dog digs 6 holes a day, the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes/day.

Now, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day to find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes.
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Aaron ran and how fast he ran, then use that information to find out how long it took Vanessa to run her part.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run half of 4 miles, which is 2 miles.

We are also told that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Let's say it took Vanessa 'x' minutes to run 1 mile. Then it would take Aaron 'x/2' minutes to run 1 mile.

Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2 * (x/2) = 16

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 16

So it took Vanessa 'x' = 16 minutes to run 1 mile. Since she ran 4 miles, it took her 4 * 16 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. So, we can write another equation:

2c + 4w = 70

Now, we can solve these equations. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'c' the same in both equations:

2c + 2w = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c':

(2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40
2w = 30

Now, we can divide by 2 to find 'w':

w = 15

Now that we know 'w', we can find 'c' by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, the number of chickens is 5.
