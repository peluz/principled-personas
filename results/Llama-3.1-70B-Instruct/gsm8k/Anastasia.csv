"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so the total number of eggs she uses is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

The number of eggs she sells is 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes every day at the farmers' market is 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it takes half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 bolts, the amount of white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber (2 bolts) and the amount of white fiber (1 bolt) to get the total number of bolts.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the house and then subtract the total cost from it.

The cost of the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% + 150%). 

The original value of the house is $80,000. The new value is 250% of $80,000, which is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

However, the $50,000 in repairs also contributed to the increased value. To find the selling price, we need to add the value added by the repairs to the original value of the house. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, the value added by the repairs is $80,000 * 150% = $120,000. But we already know the repairs cost $50,000, so the actual increase in value is $120,000 - $50,000 = $70,000 (this is the value added by the repairs, not the selling price). The selling price is the original value of the house plus the value added by the repairs, which is $80,000 + $70,000 = $150,000 + $50,000 (the cost of repairs) is not added to the selling price, but the $50,000 is part of the $200,000. The selling price is $200,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs a total of 3 * 3 = 9 sprints per week.

Since each sprint is 60 meters, the total distance he runs per week is 9 * 60 = 540 meters.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we first need to find out the total amount of feed needed for the day. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

So, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses in pairs, since every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass.

The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of a pair of glasses is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to get 8 pairs of glasses.

The cost of 8 pairs of glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

However, this calculation assumes that the discount applies to every second glass, not just the second glass. To confirm, let's calculate the total cost of 16 glasses with the discount applied to every second glass:

Glasses 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 cost $5 each, for a total of 8 * $5 = $40.
Glasses 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 cost $3 each, for a total of 8 * $3 = $24.

The total cost is $40 + $24 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find the total number of sheep, we need to find the number of sheep in each city. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in each city to find the total number of sheep: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. 

Since Carla can download 2 GB per minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. 

After the restart, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. So, she downloads the entire 200 GB file. The time it takes to download 200 GB is 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (complete download) = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around.

In the first 2 hours, he was in standstill traffic, so he didn't move.

In the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drove at 30 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

In the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5), he drove at 80 mph. The distance he traveled in this time is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

The total distance he traveled in the 4 hours after turning around is:
Total Distance = 15 + 120 = 135 miles

However, we also need to consider the distance he traveled before turning around. He drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance he traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he was trying to get back home, we need to subtract the distance he traveled after turning around from the distance he traveled before turning around:
Distance from home = 180 - 135 = 45 miles

"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the number of downloads in the third month, we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54. 
So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, we can find the total number of downloads by adding the downloads for each month: 
60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. Each year, the cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. The revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.

Let's calculate the total cost and revenue for each year:

Year 1: Total cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $93. Total revenue = $10.5. Net loss = $93 - $10.5 = $82.5.
Year 2: Total cost = $93 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $96. Total revenue = $10.5 * 2 = $21. Net loss = $96 - $21 = $75.
Year 3: Total cost = $96 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $99. Total revenue = $10.5 * 3 = $31.5. Net loss = $99 - $31.5 = $67.5.
Year 4: Total cost = $99 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $102. Total revenue = $10.5 * 4 = $42. Net loss = $102 - $42 = $60.
Year 5: Total cost = $102 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $105. Total revenue = $10.5 * 5 = $52.5. Net loss = $105 - $52.5 = $52.5.
Year 6: Total cost = $105 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $108. Total revenue = $10.5 * 6 = $63. Net loss = $108 - $63 = $45.
Year 7: Total cost = $108 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $111. Total revenue = $10.5 * 7 = $73.5. Net loss = $111 - $73.5 = $37.5.
Year 8: Total cost = $111 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $114. Total revenue = $10.5 * 8 = $84. Net loss = $114 - $84 = $30.
Year 9: Total cost = $114 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $117. Total revenue = $10.5 * 9 = $94.5. Net loss = $117 - $94.5 = $22.5.
Year 10: Total cost = $117 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $120. Total revenue = $10.5 * 10 = $105. Net loss = $120 - $105 = $15.
Year 11: Total cost = $120 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $123. Total revenue = $10.5 * 11 = $115.5. Net loss = $123 - $115.5 = $7.5.
Year 12: Total cost = $123 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $126. Total revenue = $10.5 * 12 = $126. Net loss = $126 - $126 = $0.
Year 13: Total cost = $126 (previous year's cost) + $3 (watering and feeding) = $129. Total revenue = $10.5 * 13 = $136.5. Net gain = $136.5 - $129 = $7.5.

It will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

John sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the amount he had left should equal the amount he made from selling lego sets. 

$160 (video games) + $5 (left) = $165

Since John made $195 and only spent $165, that means he didn't spend the money from all 13 lego sets. The amount he didn't spend is $195 - $165 = $30.

Since each lego set is $15, the number of lego sets he didn't sell is $30 / $15 = 2.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In 6 hours, she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.

Distance = speed * time. 
Distance covered while running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles.
Distance covered while walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

Total distance covered = 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To find the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone, we need to multiply the original distance by 3. 

Distance without gemstone: 400 feet
Distance with gemstone: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, we subtract that from the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone to find out how far outside the reach of the flames she can stand.

Distance outside the reach of flames: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

"To find out how many grams you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left for the day. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for the day.

Since the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, we need to find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories.
200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.
300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving.
60g per serving * 0.8 servings = 48g.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate his total revenue and subtract his total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Now, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is (2/5) * 5 = 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package and subtract the number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. After using them, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. 

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x. The total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the package is 80 + x. 

Since she used 220 Post-it notes, the number of Post-it notes she had after using them is (80 + x) - 220. We know that this number is 23.

So, we can set up the equation: (80 + x) - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation: 80 + x - 220 = 23
Combine like terms: -140 + x = 23
Add 140 to both sides: x = 163

The number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163."
"To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to first find out how many blue ties he bought and then how many red ties he bought.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

Uriah removed 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the weight of toys to be removed (7.5 pounds) by the weight of each toy (1/2 pound). 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday.

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue on Friday is $480.

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time and add them together.

The first time it rang 4 times. 
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times. 
The third time it rang half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her monthly salary after the 10% increase and then multiply it by 12.

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. 
The 10% increase is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60.
So, her new monthly salary after the increase is $600 + $60 = $660.

Since this increase happens every year for the next three years, we need to calculate the increase for each year.

Year 1: $660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + 0.1 * $660 = $660 + $66 = $726.
Year 2: $726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + 0.1 * $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.
Year 3: $798.60 + 10% of $798.60 = $798.60 + 0.1 * $798.60 = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46.

Now, we multiply the final monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary.
Annual salary = $878.46 * 12 = $10,541.52.

"Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Harald and Marilyn, which is 88,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina will need, we first need to calculate the number of guests that will actually show up. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests that will show up as follows:

Number of guests that will show up = Total number of guests - (1/4 * Total number of guests)
= 16 - (1/4 * 16)
= 16 - 4
= 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, the total number of gift bags she needs is:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * Number of guests that will show up
= 0.75 * 12
= 9

The cost of the gift bags is $2 each, so the total cost will be:

Total cost = Total gift bags * Cost per gift bag
= 9 * 2

"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

Adults eat 10 lbs of potato salad each. There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

Children eat half as much as adults, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to find the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of pet dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes are in 64 ounces. Each can is 16 ounces, so we divide 64 by 16 to get the number of cans: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to get the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12.

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours of TV he watched on other days and subtract that from the total hours of TV he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, so that's 2 hours. 
On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. 
On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 2 hours.

Total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes per episode to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using a variable to represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Let's call this number x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, the number of cookies he meant to bake this year is 2x.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

He then drops 5 cookies, so the total number of cookies he has left is (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are told that this number is equal to 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 50

So Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many feet Julia rowed to reach the shore and then divide that by 10 to find out how many 10-foot intervals she rowed. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how many feet she rows per second by dividing 20 feet by 16 seconds. 
20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can multiply the time by the speed to find the distance.
Distance = speed * time
Distance = 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
Distance = 80 feet

Now we can divide the distance by 10 to find the number of 10-foot intervals.
80 feet / 10 feet = 8 intervals

Since the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can multiply the number of intervals by 2 to find the total amount of water taken on.
Total water = 8 intervals * 2 liters/interval
Total water = 16 liters

1800 = 6 * Brittany's phone capacity

Now, we can solve for Brittany's phone capacity:
Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

It is given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, we can set up the equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * number of ducks

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to calculate their individual salaries.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 40%, we can calculate his new salary as follows:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $40,000 + (0.4 * $40,000)
New salary = $40,000 + $16,000
New salary = $56,000

Now, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + (30% of Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + (0.3 * Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
New salary = Old salary + (40% of old salary)
New salary = $30,769.23 + (0.4 * $30,769.23)
New salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
New salary = $43,076.92

Now, we can calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later:

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors in minutes: 
500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Now, convert the total time to hours: 
12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

The cost of the doctors to the hospital is: 
200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

The revenue from the patients is: 
200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit the hospital makes is the revenue minus the cost: 
$40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

"To find out how many elves are left, we need to first calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomited on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can calculate this as:

60 / 3 = 20 elves quit

Now, we subtract the number of elves who quit from the total number of elves:

60 - 20 = 40 elves remaining

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these from the remaining elves:

40 - 10 = 30 elves left

"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to calculate his expenditure for June and then add it to his expenditure for May.

Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. 
In June, his expenditure was $60 less, so his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add his expenditure for May and June: $500 + $440 = $940.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides and multiply it by the cost per ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Together, they rode a total of 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, on Tuesday, he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. To find the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday, we add 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

We are given that Walt's total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles. 

So, miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - miles walked on Monday and Tuesday

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this as follows:

9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

We know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q. 
We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 
Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation for W: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so Q + B + W = 700. 
Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into this equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. 
Combining like terms, we get 7Q = 700. 
Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W. 
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200. 
W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

"To find out how long the winner will be waiting, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home.

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve's time is less than Tim's time, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long Steve will be waiting, we subtract his time from Tim's time.

2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
5. Let's say the original number of fries is x. After the seagull and pigeons ate, there were x - 30 fries left.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the age of each bird. 

Since Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are the same age, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages: 
8 (Sally Four) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the total minimum payment and then the total payment with the 50% increase.

Minimum payment:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add it to the total minimum payment.
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500
Total payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the total payment in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12.
Total payment in a year: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

Time to peel a potato: 1 minute 30 seconds = 1.5 minutes
Time to cut a potato: 5 seconds = 0.0833 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel and cut a potato: 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the total time per potato by 60:

Total time to peel and cut 60 potatoes: 1.5833 * 60 = 95 minutes

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to calculate the total profit and then work backwards. 

First, let's find out the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2, so the total cost is $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon, which is $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.

Since they made a total profit of $25, we can divide this by the profit per gallon to find the number of gallons they made: $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons.

Finally, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon to find the total amount spent on lemons: 5 gallons * $3 per gallon = $15.

So, 5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

Since Jan is 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

Mark's current age would be 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age would be 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

"To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4x400 meter relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by this team is:
55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds

The less well-rounded team has the first runner running 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So, the times for the 4 runners are:
60, 57, 54, 51 seconds

The total time taken by this team is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, we subtract the total time taken by the well-rounded team from the total time taken by the less well-rounded team to find the difference:
222 - 220 = 2 seconds

However, the question asks how many seconds the faster team will win by. Since the well-rounded team is the faster team, we need to find the difference in the other direction:
220 - 222 is not correct, we need to find the difference in the other direction, so we do 222 - 220 = 2, then we do 220 - (222 - 2) = 0, no, we just do 2.

The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes. 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. Since Jerry is rolling the die twice, we need to multiply the probabilities together: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, let's find the difference in probabilities: 50% - 25% = 25%.

We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140.

We also know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters from the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats and hamsters. This will give us the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats: 140 - 50 = 90.

We know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages of rats. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 6 * number of rats. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats is 3 times the number of rats in each cage. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as x. Then, the total number of rats is 3x. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.

We know that the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 90. So, we can set up the equation 18x = 90.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 18: x = 90 / 18 = 5.

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

On the first day, there were 100 customers. 
On the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day, so there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

We are given that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons.

In 4 minutes, both pools lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

Now we know that the small pool had 24 gallons 4 minutes ago. Since it lost 16 gallons, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay back, which is the initial amount plus 10% of the initial amount.

Initial amount: $2000
Additional amount (10% of $2000): $2000 * 0.1 = $200
Total amount to be paid back: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is:

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, let's add 3 years to each of their ages to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can add these points to find out how many points they scored in total: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

New total cards = 30 fire type + 34 grass type + 32 water type = 96

Now, we can find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total cards) * 100

25 / 5 = 5

So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the initial 25 empty pens. Now, he has 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

However, the 5 new pens will also run out of ink eventually. Ram can then use those 5 empty pens to make 1 more pen (5 / 5 = 1).

Now, he has 30 (previous pens) + 1 (new pen) = 31 pens.

But the process doesn't stop here. The 1 new pen will also run out of ink, and Ram can use it to make 1/5 of a pen. However, since he can't make a fraction of a pen, we can stop here.

So, Ram gets to have a total of 31 pens.

Now, we need to subtract 30% of the total weight to find the weight after the termites ate 30% of the tree.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds
Weight after termites ate 30% = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and there are 8 books. 
So, the cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

Adding the flat fee of $2.00, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to find the number of apples and bananas each person has.

Andrea has 52 apples. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas each person has:
Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92
Total number of fruits: 76 + 92 = 168

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to find out how many dozens of cookies she's making. 

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Since a dozen is 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the total number of dozens. 
66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozen cookies.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed.
5.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 11 cups of flour.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, we subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total: 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

When the paper is folded vertically, the front and back of each page are paired. Since there are 32 pages, we can pair them up as follows:

Page 1 (back) and Page 2 (front)
Page 3 (back) and Page 4 (front)

Since each pair of pages is printed on a single piece of paper, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pieces of paper used.

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are paired in a straightforward manner. But in this case, the pages are arranged in a specific way, with page 1 on the left back and page 32 on the right back. This arrangement implies that the pages are paired in a way that requires 8 pieces of paper for the front and 8 pieces of paper for the back, but these are the same 8 pieces of paper.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to find out how many books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, so she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books and she started with 250 books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonuses.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours per week. 
He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500 per week.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. 
There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so Watson's total bonuses for the month are 4 * $300 = $1200.

Watson's total earnings for the month from his hourly wage are 4 * $500 = $2000.

Watson's total earnings for the month are $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate the number of people he lost to out of the 20 people he arm-wrestled.

First, we find out how many people he beat: 80% of 20 is 0.8 * 20 = 16 people.

Since he arm-wrestled 20 people and beat 16, he lost to 20 - 16 = 4 people.

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the information given.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
Two-thirds of 60 is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

So, 60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left after the morning sales.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of 10, which is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses in 4 weeks by 4. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, and Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in 4 weeks, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks, then multiply by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose that weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. 
Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks. 
8 pounds / 2 pounds = 4. 
4 * 4 weeks = 16 weeks.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings from the ice cream and the milk separately, then add them together.

For the ice cream, the original price is $13, and the sale price is $11. The savings per tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total savings from the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4.

For the milk, the discount is $0.5 per packet. Since we are buying 4 packets, the total savings from the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2.

The total savings is the sum of the savings from the ice cream and the milk: $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate his total expenses first.

6 business suits at $100 each will cost 6 * $100 = $600.
3 suitcases at $50 each will cost 3 * $50 = $150.
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500.
So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.
Total expenses so far are $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.
He also wants to save $2000 for the trip.

Total money set aside for the trip is $1950 (expenses) + $2000 (savings) = $3950.
He has $6000 for the trip, so he has $6000 - $3950 = $2050 left to spend on gifts.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed per day and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
The rest of the family (5 - 3 = 2 people) eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.
Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to determine Jane's age first. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We also know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also told that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Population of Chile now: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'D'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D. 

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

The total number of players is 105, so we can set up the equation:
D + 2D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:
(2D + D) + D/2 = 105
3D + D/2 = 105

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
6D + D = 210
7D = 210

Divide both sides by 7:
D = 210 / 7
D = 30

Number of players on the defense: 30"

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon initially had 50 marbles. He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so now he has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, Solomon has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The volume of the pool is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth:
Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
Cost = volume * cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 * 0.1

"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires

We can then cross-multiply and solve for x:

3x = 45
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find out how many pencils Jam has in boxes, we subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total number of pencils she has. 
26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in boxes.

Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, we divide the total number of pencils in boxes by 3 to find out how many pencils each box can hold.
24 (pencils in boxes) / 3 (boxes) = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have to find out the total number of pencils they have together.
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

To find out how many boxes they need, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to first find the number of junior and senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since there are 100 employees in total, and 40 are junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

However, we need to note that not all 60 remaining employees are senior programmers. The problem states that the company has employed 100 people, but it doesn't say all of them are programmers. We can only assume the 40 junior programmers are part of the 100 employees, but we can't assume the remaining 60 are all senior programmers. We can only assume the remaining 60 are non-programmers and other employees.

However, for the sake of this problem, let's assume the remaining 60 are all non-programmers and other employees, and the 40 junior programmers are the only programmers in the company. But the problem states senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so there must be some senior programmers.

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people becomes x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people becomes (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2. Then, 8 more people got in, making the total number of people x - 2 + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. So, we can set up the equation x + 6 = 20.

To find the value of x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 6 = 14.

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, let's break down the problem step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He then passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage points to be charged and then multiply it by the time it takes to charge 1 percentage point.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 40% more to be fully charged (100% - 60% = 40%).

Since it takes 3 minutes to charge 1 percentage point, it will take 40 * 3 minutes to charge 40 percentage points.

40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. However, six people returned their pairs, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add the number of pairs sold each day to find the total number of pairs sold:
14 + 28 + 8 = 50

Since each pair contains 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from both halves of the sheep.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other half (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50.

"To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

Since Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks in pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

In addition to the pairs, Lindsay also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then add it to the principal amount. 

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given: 
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% = 0.1
Time = 5 months = 5/12 years (since there are 12 months in a year)

Interest = $3,650 * 0.1 * (5/12) 
Interest = $3,650 * 0.1 * 0.4167 
Interest = $152.08

Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest 
Total amount to be paid = $3,650 + $152.08 
Total amount to be paid = $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, 
Monthly payment = Total amount to be paid / 5 
Monthly payment = $3,802.08 / 5 
Monthly payment = $760.42

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has:
2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos
She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has:
80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos
The total number of pesos Anna has is:
100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

Now, we add the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have:

"To find Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total profit and then divide it by the number of hours she spends running the stand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade she can make: 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be: 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Her total cost is $18, so her total profit will be: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, she will sell all 36 cups in: 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Now, we can calculate her profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

The final answer is: 32"

Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu by multiplying the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 * 1/3
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 66 / 3
Number of messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

Total number of messages = 66 + 22

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find the value of each part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total parts in the ratio.

165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now that we know the value of each part, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is 2 * $10 = $20. 
He saves 20% of $20, which is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 
So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of his new streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find out how much money Tim saves, we subtract the cost of his new streaming services from the cost of his old cable package:

Original usage: 900 watts * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day
Since there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, we can convert this to kilowatt-hours: 7200 watt-hours / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatt-hours/day
In 30 days, the energy used at the original usage is: 7.2 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 216 kilowatt-hours

Reduced usage: 900 watts * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours/day
Converting to kilowatt-hours: 2700 watt-hours / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatt-hours/day
In 30 days, the energy used at the reduced usage is: 2.7 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 81 kilowatt-hours

The probability of a candle exploding is 0.01, and the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 0.05. The probability of both events occurring is 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005.

Now, we can multiply this probability by the total number of candles to find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode:
0.0005 * 50000 = 25

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

So, the discount on each blouse is $6. 
The discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

"To find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to break down the information given.

Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. She gathered half of this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

Since the sisters gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees. So, the number of apples she gathered from the average trees is 395 - 30 - 15 = 350 apples.

"Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. 

Since there are 180 heads in total, we can write an equation: 
c + d = 180

We also know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump. Since there are 304 humps in total, we can write another equation:
2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting 'c' into the first equation:
124 + d = 180
d = 56

3. Distance traveled on the 7th day: 0 km (he wasn't traveling)
4. Distance traveled in the second week: 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to find Zack's locker size.

Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20.

The number of cats left on the rock after the boats left is 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the introductory period, the period at the normal rate, and the period at the increased rate.

The introductory period is 6 months at $8 per month, so the cost is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The normal rate period is 8 months at $12 per month, but since we're calculating for 2 years (24 months), we subtract the introductory period (6 months) and the increased rate period (10 months, since 24 - 6 - 8 = 10) from the total months. However, we only need 8 months of this rate, so:
8 months * $12/month = $96

The increased rate period is 10 months at $14 per month, but we only need 10 months of this rate:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add the costs of all three periods:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans. 

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans. The rest of the savings, $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

Since the jogger jeans cost $22 and he saved $2, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.

Since the tattered jeans cost $28 and he saved $4, the original price of the tattered jeans was $28 + $4 = $32.

The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $32 - $24 = $8.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders herself, and each of these feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

Lillian bought 3 bird feeders, and each of these feeders attracts 20 birds per day. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he made from selling his cards. Since he spent $100 on the ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, he must have made $150.

Since he sold each card for $1.5, we can divide the total amount of money he made ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find the number of cards he sold:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

However, this is the number of cards he sold, not the number he started with. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then:

2/3 * x = 100

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 100 * (3/2)
x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To determine the number of hotdogs prepared, we first need to find out how many guests were expected to have two hotdogs. Since half of the 36 guests were expected to have two hotdogs, that would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

The total number of hotdogs prepared would be the number of guests who would have one hotdog (36 - 18 = 18) plus twice the number of guests who would have two hotdogs (18 * 2 = 36). So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 18 + 36 = 54.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the total number of hotdogs needed would be 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs short would be 80 - 54 = 26.

Since each guest who didn't get a second hotdog would be short one hotdog, the number of guests who didn't get a second hotdog would be 26.

The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

"To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to first determine how much money he spent on chips and how much he had left to spend on candy bars.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. 1% of $5 is $0.05, so he had $0.05 left. This means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent: $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75. This is the amount he spent on candy bars.

Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

Length (in feet) = 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We are also given the area of the room, which is 360 square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's:
- 10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
- James' swim time: 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' bike ride time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's:

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours at 32MPH:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 32MPH x 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay the horse eats is:

Total hay = Distance x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 16 miles x 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Cost = Total hay x Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails x $3/bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12
Total number of puppies = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4
Total number of puppies with spots = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots:
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 0.35 * 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = 35%

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles.

She drinks 3 aluminum cans per week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, in a week, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans. In a four-week month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

She drinks 5 plastic bottles per week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, in a week, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles. In a four-week month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, we add the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

Number of basketball cards = 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards
Number of baseball cards = 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards
Total number of cards = 150 cards + 200 cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are given to her students.
Number of cards given to students = 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students can be found by dividing the total number of cards given to students by 10.
Number of students = 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair of shoes has 2 shoes, we'll multiply the number of pairs by 2.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add the shoes he got:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, so we subtract 180 from 300:

20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300.
So, the hotel price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.
For 3 days, the hotel cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

"To find the calorie deficit needed per day, we first need to calculate the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 201 days (December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days, March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and 19 days in July).

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calories he needs to burn is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

Now, we divide the total calories by the number of days to find the calorie deficit per day: 105,000 / 201 ≈ 522 calories.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. 

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

Josh's cookies = 1/4 * 36
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the daily consumption by 24 to get the total daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

Daily consumption before adding the new device: 12 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
Daily consumption after adding the new device: 14 kWh/hour * 24 hours = 336 kWh

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Weekly consumption before adding the new device: 288 kWh * 7 = 2016 kWh
Weekly consumption after adding the new device: 336 kWh * 7 = 2352 kWh

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. We multiply the weekly consumption by the cost per kilowatt-hour to get the weekly electric bill.

Weekly electric bill before adding the new device: 2016 kWh * $1.50 = $3024
Weekly electric bill after adding the new device: 2352 kWh * $1.50 = $3528

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is the difference between the two bills.

"To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to first find the number of chairs each person has. 

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs by adding the number of sofas and chairs each person has. 
Total sofas = 20 (Ophelia) + 64 (Jenna) = 84

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is 5 * 8 = 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

The total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Now, let's consider Jame's cousin. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Since Jame will be 27 in 5 years, in 8 years, Jame will be 27 + 3 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than this, so Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, we can find the difference in their current ages: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to find out how much he needs to save in total for the first and second half of the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half, let's assume the daily savings in the first half is x. Then, the daily savings in the second half will be 2x.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days, and the second half is also 15 days.

The total savings for the first half of the month is 15x, and the total savings for the second half of the month is 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which is 15x + 30x = 45x.

We know that Elvis' monthly savings target is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

45x = 1125

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 45:

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

Since x is the daily savings in the first half, the daily savings in the second half is 2x, which is 2 * 25 = 50.

"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate how much he earns per week and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub and add it to the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is thrice the cost of the foot-long fish sub, which is 3 * $40 = $120.

Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost:
$40 (foot-long fish sub) + $120 (six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with 2 holes and the buttons with 4 holes separately, then add them together.

There were 7 buttons with 2 holes. 
7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

The rest of the buttons had 4 holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
21 buttons - 7 buttons = 14 buttons

14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

Now, we add the total number of holes from both types of buttons:
14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Zack's locker size = Timothy's locker size / 2
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we can find the size of Peter's locker by dividing Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size = Zack's locker size / 4
Peter's locker size = 12 / 4
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

So James needs 4 packs of candles. The total cost will be 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

"To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:
105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages = 105 / 1.5 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

We are told that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's call the nephew's age in 7 years 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3x.

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 51 / 3 = 17.

Since 'x' represents the nephew's age in 7 years, to find his current age, we subtract 7 from 'x': 17 - 7 = 10.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how many action figures he can buy with his money.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will spend $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, he can buy $10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day for 4 days. The total number of wooden action figures he can buy is 2 * 4 = 8.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He can buy $10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day for 3 days. The total number of plastic action figures he can buy is 5 * 3 = 15.

The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.
The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

The total cost is:

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayon muffins she can make and then multiply that by the price of each muffin.

First, let's find out how many small pieces of crayons Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so she has 3 x 64 = 192 crayons. Since they are all worn down to small pieces, we'll assume each crayon can be broken down into small pieces. The exact number of small pieces per crayon isn't given, but we know that 8 small pieces are needed to make one muffin.

Let's assume each crayon can be broken down into 8 small pieces (this is a reasonable assumption since 8 small pieces are needed to make one muffin). So, Kate has 192 x 8 = 1536 small pieces of crayons.

Now, let's calculate the total number of crayon muffins Kate can make. Since 8 small pieces are needed to make one muffin, we can divide the total number of small pieces by 8:

"To find the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature.

Set temperature: 450
Actual temperature: 468
Difference: 468 - 450 = 18

Percentage off: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set her oven to if her recipe calls for 520 degrees, given that it's off by 4%.

Let x be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know that the actual temperature should be 520, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520

To find 4% of x, multiply x by 0.04:
x + 0.04x = 520

Combine like terms:

Since each box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes will contain 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each pair of contacts. Since there are 2 contacts in a pair, the total number of pairs is 180 / 2 = 90 pairs.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's find out the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content per gram of mushrooms as follows:

3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms

Now, we can calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:

200 grams of mushrooms * 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he gets 6 grams of protein per day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7:

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has in cents:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 / 5 = 69

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

"To find the weight Jamaal now uses, we need to calculate the weight after the 50% increase and then subtract 2 pounds.

First, we calculate the 50% increase: 8 pounds * 0.5 = 4 pounds
Then, we add the increase to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds
Finally, we subtract 2 pounds: 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he bought each year and add the games he received for his birthday and Christmas.

In the first year, Steve bought 1 game per month, so he bought 12 games. He also received 5 games for his birthday and 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 12 + 5 + 5 = 22 games.

In the second year, Steve bought 2 games per month, so he bought 24 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 22 + 29 = 51 games.

In the third year, Steve bought 4 games per month, so he bought 48 games. He also received 5 games for Christmas, for a total of 48 + 5 = 53 games. Adding this to the previous year's total, Steve now has 51 + 53 = 104 games.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time 
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours 
Rate = 400 miles per hour 

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate. 

Time = Distance / Rate 
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour 
Time = 5 hours

"To find the amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour, we divide 120 pounds by 2 hours. 
Ruiz makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. 
However, we need to compare it to Ruiz's hourly production, so we calculate 3/4 of Ruiz's hourly production.
Marissa makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, we calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours.
Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours.
Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from the original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the amount earned in the first 4 hours and the amount earned in the next 2 hours, then add them together.

In the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
So, the amount earned per hour is 15 * $0.50 = $7.50.
The total amount earned in 4 hours is $7.50 * 4 = $30.

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. 
So, the amount earned per hour is 10 * $0.60 = $6.
The total amount earned in 2 hours is $6 * 2 = $12.

The total amount earned in 6 hours is $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find out how many rotations the tires undergo in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide 725 by 2 to get the rotations per mile.

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, multiply the rotations per mile by the miles driven per month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since we want to find out how many years the tire will last, we need to multiply the rotations per month by 12 to get the rotations per year:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the rotations per year:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can find the total number of pumps by multiplying the number of washings by the number of pumps per washing and then dividing by the number of washings per 2 pumps.

Total number of pumps = 120 washings * 2 pumps / 120 washings * 1 pump = 2 * 120 = 240 pumps / 2 = 240 / 2 = 120 * 2 = 240 / 2 = 120 * 2 = 240 / 2 = 240 / 2 = 240 / 2 = 240 / 2 = 240 / 2 = 240 / 2 =

"To find out how much money Joe will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit after the 30% discount.

The original price of the outfit is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount:
30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional amount. 

Now, subtract the cost of the outfit from Joe's initial amount:
$50 - $42 = $8

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week (7 days), we multiply 4 by 7.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen, we multiply 28 by 1/4.

28 * 1/4 = 28 * 0.25 = 7

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make these croissants.

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 
Cost to repave Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060.

To find the cost of repaving Monica's street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 
Cost to repave Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100.

To find the difference in cost, we need to subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street. 
Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

Since the research took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months, the total duration is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The remaining months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The cost per month for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial cost per month. The initial cost per month is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000. The cost per month for the remaining months is $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $30,000.

The cost for the remaining months is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

The total cost of John's research is $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the three players:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't consume any meat.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used and multiply it by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day. 

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

In addition to the gum he chews at school, he also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, the total number of pieces he chews is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister and keeps the other 7.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find 10% of that profit.

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars, so the cost of each car is:
$25,000 * 0.30 = $7,500

The profit from each car is the selling price minus the cost:
$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is:
$17,500 * 10 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his earnings are:
$175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500

"To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright, then find the number of women, and finally subtract the number of women from the total to get the number of men.

First, we find the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25.

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright. Now, we find the number of women who can stay upright. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 * 0.6 = 15

Now, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to get the number of men.

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class and then divide that by 1.5 hours per recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.
Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in class is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours by 1.5 hours per recipe to find out how many recipes John learns: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so we add 60 to Kassidy's amount:
$90 + 60 = $150

Now we know how much each person has:
- Aurelia: $120
- Kassidy: $90
- Rayna: $150

To find out how much they would have if they shared their money equally, we need to add their money together and divide by 3:

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we first need to determine the total number of good days in the first 30 days. Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. 

In the first 8 days, she had 8 good days. Then, in the next 8 days, she had 0 good days. In the next 8 days, she had 0 good days. So, in the first 24 days, she had 8 good days. 

Since she had 12 good days in the first 30 days, she must have had 12 - 8 = 4 good days in the last 6 days of the first 30 days.

Now, we need to consider the next 3 days. She had 2 good days in the next 3 days. 

So, the total number of good days in the month is 12 (in the first 30 days) + 2 (in the next 3 days) = 14. However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month, which is the number of good days in the last 3 days.

Now, we need to find the difference between the desired height (600 inches) and the current height (240 inches):

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Initially, James had 4 dogs and 4 toys. Then, 8 more dogs arrived, making the total number of dogs 4 + 8 = 12.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means the number of dogs doubled. So, the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.

However, 3 dogs left, so we subtract 3 from the total number of dogs: 24 - 3 = 21.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the new length is 1.5 times the original length (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 times the original). So, the length after extension is 1.5x.

She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140cm. So, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:

"Let's denote the age of one twin as T and the age of one triplet as t. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write an equation: T = t + 7.

We know that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the combined ages of the twins are 2T and the combined ages of the triplets are 3t. The total combined ages are 44, so we can write another equation: 2T + 3t = 44.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44. Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + 3t = 44. Combining like terms, we get: 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get: 5t = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get: t = 6.

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin using the first equation: T = t + 7. Substituting t = 6, we get: T = 6 + 7 = 13.

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $40 / 0.4 = $100.

"To find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream separately and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the quarts of chocolate ice cream made in 48 hours, we can multiply the quarts made in 2 hours by 24 (since 48 hours / 2 hours = 24).

Quarts of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours = 100 quarts * 24 = 2400 quarts

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the quarts of vanilla ice cream made in 48 hours, we can multiply the quarts made in 4 hours by 12 (since 48 hours / 4 hours = 12).

Quarts of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours = 50 quarts * 12 = 600 quarts

Now, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream to find the total quarts made in 48 hours.

Total quarts = 2400 + 600 = 3000

"To find the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to calculate the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. The price increased by 10%, so we need to find 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = original price + price increase

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the taps for the time with arms raised and the time with arms at her sides, then add them together.

When Helga's arms are raised, she taps each foot 200 times per minute. Since she does this for 2 minutes, the total taps for each foot during this time is 200 * 2 = 400. Since she has two feet, the total taps for this time is 400 * 2 = 800.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute. Since she does this for 3 minutes (5 total minutes - 2 minutes with arms raised), the total taps for her right foot during this time is 300 * 3 = 900, and the total taps for her left foot during this time is 250 * 3 = 750. The total taps for this time is 900 + 750 = 1650.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 2/3 * 3 = 2 pizzas. 
Each pizza has 12 slices, so they ate 2 * 12 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate ¾ * 2 = 1.5 pizzas. 
Each pizza has 12 slices, so they ate 1.5 * 12 = 18 slices.

In total, they ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

There are 5 friends in total, and each ordered a pizza. So, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

The dog takes 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes to eat the sausages.

Now, we find the average time by adding the time taken by the cat and the dog, then dividing by 2.

For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows is 32 * 2 = 64. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, she smashes 64 * 3/4 = 48 windows.

The total number of windows smashed is 64 + 48 = 112.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since a large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

She already had 9 large buttons and got 20 more, so she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons.

She also got 60 small buttons and had 3 small stickers left, which are worth 3 small buttons. So she has 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons.

Since a large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons to get the total number of buttons. 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

So, the total number of buttons is 87 + 63 = 150.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and each member votes either for or against the regulation. Therefore, the total number of votes is equal to the total number of council members.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor is 2x, the number of votes in favor is 2 * 11 = 22.

The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars, but since it says two pizzas cost 30 dollars, we can assume it means two pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. So the two pizzas cost 30 dollars in total, not each.

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. The cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars in total is 30 dollars. 

So, the cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work:

Billy's earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to first find half of Pierson's score. 
Half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139. 
Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points. 
Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores to find the total. 
278 + 150 = 428.

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately, then add them together.

Number of students per class: 25
Number of classes: 40
Total number of students: 25 * 40 = 1000
Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students: 1000

Number of teachers per class: 3
Number of classes: 40
Total number of teachers: 3 * 40 = 120
Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers: 120 * 2 = 240

Total number of trees planted: 1000 (by students) + 240 (by teachers) = 1240

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all of her stuffed animals, let's assume the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x.

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the equation:

(x / (14 + x)) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 100:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

Now, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Now, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we need to calculate the total hours she has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. 
Half an hour per day for 14 days is 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours.

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. 
2 hours per day for 7 days is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play 30 hours. 
So, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is ahead of the first car, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them:
Distance between cars = Distance traveled by second car - Distance traveled by first car
Distance between cars = 140 miles - 120 miles
Distance between cars = 20 miles

"To find the total cost, first, we need to calculate the total cost of the diamond and the gold. 

The diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300. 
Total cost of diamond and gold = $600 + $300 = $900

Now, we need to calculate the 30% premium. 
Premium = 30% of $900 = 0.3 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold to get the final amount James paid.
Total amount paid = $900 + $270 = $1170

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340 out of 500.
The number of fourth-graders who passed is 40 out of 100.
The pass rate of the fourth-graders is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
The pass rate of the fifth-graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth-graders, which is 2 * 40% = 80%.
The number of fifth-graders who passed is 80% of 400, which is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

The total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.
The total number of students who took the test is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students who took the test, which is 700/1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first find out how many square inches he can cover with the glass chips he has.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips. So, he has a total of 2 * 72 = 144 glass chips.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, the total number of square inches he can cover is 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, the length of the mosaic will be the total square inches divided by the height. 

So, the length of the mosaic will be 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"To find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and add it to the remaining tea.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by them is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed by all students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Adding the remaining tea, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea to gallons by dividing by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

Initially, Dale ordered 100 candies. Then, he ordered 100 more, so the total number of candies he has is:
100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200

However, he has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number sold from the total:

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21

Now, let's subtract the total marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag.

Marshmallows left = 35 (initial) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14

"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total number of quarters used by each person and then add them up.

Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter. Since they play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, Jack will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

Two of his friends are significantly worse and can only play half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. They will use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each. Since there are two of them, they will use a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter. He will use 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (one friend) = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68 * $0.25 = $17.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's denote the amount of zest as 'x'. Then the amount of fragrance is also 'x'. The amount of salt is 2x, and the amount of sugar is also 2x. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so it's 2 * 2x = 4x.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can set up the equation:

x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10

Combine like terms:
x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10
10x = 10

Divide both sides by 10:
x = 1

Now that we know x is 1, we can find the amount of oil:

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is used and subtract it from the original length.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm used.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. 
1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm used.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. 
1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm used.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the total original length minus the total used length. 
3 * 12 mm = 36 mm (total original length)
36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes. Since he collected twice as many dishes as socks, he must have collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

2. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

3. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
   Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
   Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

5. Total number of socks and dishes = Total socks + Total dishes = 90 + 90 = 180

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this number gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

However, the question states that in the third year, they will double the amount they have built. This means they will build double the amount they have built, not double the amount they have built and add it to the previous amount. So, in the third year, they will build 96 homes, not add 96 to the previous amount.

"Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, we can express this as:

I am 2 years older than my sister, so:
A = S + 2

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. Let's denote my mom's age as M:
M = 3B - 1

When you add all our ages, you get 87:
A + B + S + M = 87

Now, let's substitute the expressions for A and M:
(B - 3) + B + (A - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 + 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
(B - 3) + B + (B - 1) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine like terms:
6B - 6 = 87
6B = 93
B = 15.5

Since B must be a whole number, we'll round it to the nearest whole number. However, we'll try both 15 and 16 to see which one works.

If B = 15:
A = B - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12
S = A - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10
M = 3B - 1 = 3(15) - 1 = 44
A + B + S + M = 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81 (not 87)

If B = 16:
A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
S = A - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11
M = 3B - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 47

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. In a year (12 months), Claire will earn 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber will earn 6 badges (12 months / 2 months per badge).

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Wendy earns 3 badges per month. In a year, Wendy will earn 36 badges (3 badges per month * 12 months).

Now, let's compare the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year. Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges. To find the difference, subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

"To find the number of microphones that won't find any space, we need to calculate 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

This means 10 microphones won't find any space. The remaining microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

Number of remaining microphones = 50 - 10 = 40

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, we need to divide the number of remaining microphones by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to find the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, we can divide the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Speed of whatchamacallit = 121 meters per second
Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now, since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5 to find the speed of the whirligig.

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first determine how much she made from mowing lawns. 

We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid her $6, and assuming the pay is per mowing, she mowed Joe's lawn once. Therefore, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she made from mowing lawns. 
- Joe's lawn: 1 * $6 = $6
- Kamala's lawn: 3 * $6 = $18
- Alba's lawn: 5 * $6 = $30

Total amount from mowing lawns: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Now, we know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount.

$80 - $54 = $26

"To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to calculate the leftover soup first.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will eat 2 adult bowls. Their 2 children will eat 2 child bowls. 

The total number of bowls eaten is 2 adult bowls and 2 child bowls. Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the total number of bowls eaten in child bowls is 2*2 + 2 = 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup is 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Adam's current age be x.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was 60 - 8 = 52.
Four years ago, Adam's age was x - 4.

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

52 = 2(x - 4)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

52 = 2x - 8
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x
x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

We also know that L = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
And the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so P + L + J = 100

Substituting L = J + 10 into P = L + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and L = J + 10 into P + L + J = 100, we get
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know J, we can find L:

"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it will make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month. Each widget sells for $6.

The Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 * 6 = $259200 in a month.

The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 * 6 = $194400 in a month.

The difference in the amount of money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000 is $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options.

Option 1: 24-hour stay
The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. 
The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. 
The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
The total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250

"To find the amount of hay needed, we first need to determine how much each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount for each sheep as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * (goat's hay) - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 goats * 5 pounds
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = 12 sheep * 7 pounds
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

"To find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract his expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 * 6 = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars left

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars left

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends:
5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now he has:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars left

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of a pen:

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we need to calculate the total number of bottles she gets from the coupons and subtract the number of bottles she gives to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

The teacher gives each of the 29 students 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles she gives away is:
29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles she gives away from the total number of bottles she gets:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

The total cost of the CDs is 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got a 40% discount, the amount he saved is 40% of $150, which is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He sold 5 CDs for $40, so he got back $40.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid: $90 - $40 = $50.

"To find the total time it took James to cross the lake, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. At a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Finally, James swims the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the initial swimming time, the resting time, and the final swimming time: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"Let's denote Azibo's points as A, Bahati's points as B, and Dinar's points as D. 

We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that A + B + D = 45.

Since B = A + 20, we can substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (A + 20) + D = 45.

Also, since B = D + 10, we can substitute B in the equation A + B + D = 45 to get A + (D + 10) + D = 45.

Now we have two equations: 
A + (A + 20) + D = 45 
A + (D + 10) + D = 45

Simplifying the first equation, we get 2A + D + 20 = 45. 
Simplifying the second equation, we get A + 2D + 10 = 45.

Now we have two simplified equations:
2A + D + 20 = 45 
A + 2D + 10 = 45

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the first equation, we get 2A + D = 25.
Subtracting 10 from both sides of the second equation, we get A + 2D = 35.

Now we have two simplified equations:
2A + D = 25 
A + 2D = 35

Multiplying the second equation by 2, we get 2A + 4D = 70.

Now we have two simplified equations:
2A + D = 25 
2A + 4D = 70

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get 3D = 45.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get D = 15.

Now that we know D, we can substitute D in the equation B = D + 10 to get B = 15 + 10 = 25.

Now that we know B, we can substitute B in the equation B = A + 20 to get 25 = A + 20.

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get A = 5.

First, let's find the total number of hours: 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes: 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes by 15 minutes to find the number of 15-minute intervals: 900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval: 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 2, we know that when Emil is 24, his dad's age will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, 5 years will pass before he turns 24. So, his dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

From point 3, we know that when Emil is 24, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Since Emil is 19 now, 5 years will pass before he turns 24. So, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother:
Sum = Dad's current age + Brother's current age
Sum = 43 + 7
Sum = 50

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from each person:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90

"To find the total number of servings, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught is 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the total number of servings is 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players.
20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

Now, we need to find the number of remaining students who are not football players.
30 - 6 = 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.
25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early.
6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can multiply Sophie's shoe size by 5 to find Charlie's shoe size.

Charlie's shoe size = 5 * Sophie's shoe size
Charlie's shoe size = 5 * 5
Charlie's shoe size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their shoe sizes and dividing by 2.

Average shoe size = (Charlie's shoe size + Sophie's shoe size) / 2
Average shoe size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average shoe size = 30 / 2
Average shoe size = 15

"To find out how many flowers Pat needs, we first need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply 111 feet by 12 inches.

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we need to find out how many spaces of 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) plus the width of the flower (12 inches) we can fit in the flower bed. 

The total space required for each plant is 18 inches + 12 inches = 30 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the space required for each plant.

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flowering plant costs $6, so Pat will spend:

Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 apiece, so the cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.
Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost will be 5 * $14.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract the soil used from the total amount of soil to find out how much is left for the roses.

30 pounds (total) - 27 pounds (used) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:

First, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her:
90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her:
90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

"To find the final temperature difference, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on low is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling on high is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up by 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. So, the total warming is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming, which is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to determine his age when he saw it the second time and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is 3 * 30 = 90 years.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is 90 - 75 = 15 years.

The second plane makes 44 trips. Since this is half the number of flights the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between France and Germany. 

So, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the lengths of the three wolves' howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the combined length of time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that the total age of the children is 20. 

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W and the age of Helene as H. We know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. 

The total age of the children is 20, so we can write the equation:
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + H + W = 20

Now, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

The average age is (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can write the equation:
H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now we can substitute H into the first equation:
7 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants:
17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."

"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine the total number of slices and the number of slices each adult gets.

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults. Since there are 4 kids and 2 adults, the total number of slices is 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

The number of slices each adult gets is 2x. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:

First, let's calculate the charge lost in the last 3 hours when the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. 

Since the charge remaining was 28% after 3 hours, we can set up an equation to find the charge before the last 3 hours:

Charge before the last 3 hours = 28% / (1 - 0.07)^3
Charge before the last 3 hours = 28% / (0.93)^3
Charge before the last 3 hours = 28% / 0.794
Charge before the last 3 hours = 35.26%

Now, let's calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours when the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour.

Charge before the first 5 hours = 35.26% / (1 - 0.09)^5
Charge before the first 5 hours = 35.26% / (0.91)^5
Charge before the first 5 hours = 35.26% / 0.624

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, and then find out how many of those she is sure to get correct.

First, let's find the number of easy questions: 
60 * 0.4 = 24 easy questions.

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can find the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
60 - 24 = 36 questions
36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions Aries is sure to get correct:
Easy questions: 24 * 0.75 = 18
Average questions: 18 * 0.5 = 9
Difficult questions: 18 * 0.5 = 9

Total points Aries is sure to get: 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as L and the number of small stuffed animals sold as S. We know that S = 2L, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since a small stuffed animal costs $4, a large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is $4 * S, and the total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is $12 * L. The total earnings from both is $120, so we can set up the equation:

$4 * S + $12 * L = $120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get:

$4 * 2L + $12 * L = $120
$8L + $12L = $120
$20L = $120

Dividing both sides by $20, we get:

L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find S:

S = 2 * 6
S = 12

"To find the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to calculate the amount each dwarf can mine per day and then multiply it by the number of dwarves and the number of days.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's multiply the amount each dwarf can mine per day by the number of dwarves and the number of days:
36 pounds/day * 40 dwarves = 1440 pounds/day
1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds

The original price of the bedroom set is $3000. 
He pays $1000 from selling his old bedroom set, so the remaining amount is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we calculate 10% of $2000.
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had at each step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

When 40% of the red balloons burst, she lost 40% of 25, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

The green balloons were not affected, so she still had 7 green balloons.

When she released half of the yellow balloons, she lost 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's add up the number of balloons she had: 
15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 34 balloons.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios in which he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. 

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance), there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance) and doesn't give an extension (60% chance), there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus getting a personal extension is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.

Now, let's add up the probabilities of Marcus not having to turn in his homework: 50% (substitute teacher) + 20% (normal teacher and extension) + 6% (normal teacher, no extension, and personal extension) = 76%.

So, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

"To find John's average score, we need to add up all his scores and divide by the number of tests.

John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total score for those tests is 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. 
He scored 80 on his 4th test, so the total score for all 4 tests is 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

"To find the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 pizzas is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.
So, the glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.
So, the football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left.

In total, there are 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas left.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing the small coupons is:
700 * 0.05 = 35 dollars

He also wants to send out twice as many big coupons, which is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost of mailing the big coupons is:
1400 * 0.15 = 210 dollars

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost of postage:
35 + 210 = 245 dollars

"To find the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.

Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 + 3 = 6.

The total number of meatballs in 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to first find out how many trucks were able to deliver the fertiliser. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we need to find a quarter of 20 trucks. 
A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks were unable to deliver the fertiliser. 
The number of trucks that were able to deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the total number of guests and then determine the additional cost beyond the initial 20 guests.

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. So, the total number of people invited is:
25 + 7 + 13 = 45

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is:
45 - 4 = 41

Since the fee is for a party of 20, and there are 21 additional guests (41 - 20 = 21), we need to calculate the cost for these extra guests:
21 * $6 = $126

Now, we add the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost:
$125 + $126 = $251

1/4 * $60 = $15

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. 
1/3 * $60 = $20

Now, let's calculate how much money they have left:

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to find out the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, we divide 315 by 7 to find the number of bananas eaten in a day:
315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is:
10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a day:
45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to determine the cost of the roses and the amount of change she receives.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15, she can buy a dozen for $15 and 3 more roses at $2 each. 

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 * $5 = $25. 

The change she receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the change is given in quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, the number of quarters she receives is $4 / $0.25 = 16.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between the current time and the arrival of the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. So, it arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she has already collected. 

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the price at which he bought the watch and compare it to the original price.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, which is:
$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is:
$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. To do this, we'll calculate the discount amount and then find the percentage:
Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by friend
= $2000 - $1800

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To find out how much Marcel earned, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and multiply it by the price of each bike.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes is:
300 / 2 = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes is:
300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes were MTB type, the number of MTB bikes is:
300 - 150 - 45 = 105

The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250. The price of a Trekking bike is $450.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

"To find the total number of hours John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and extra learning time, then convert it to hours.

John has 6 periods in a normal day, but he takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes per week in class.

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. To find the total weekly minutes, we need to add the minutes he spends in class and the extra learning time. 

First, we find the extra learning time. 1/16 of his weekly minutes is 1/16 * 1600 = 100 minutes. Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, he spends 100 * 2 = 200 minutes on extra learning time.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the extra learning time: 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

The probability of choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas. So, the probability is 2/8, which can be simplified to 1/4 or 0.25.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her retirement savings goal and then determine how many years it will take her to reach that goal.

Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000, and she wants to live on 40% of that during retirement, which is $40,000 per year. Since she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, her total retirement savings goal is:

$40,000 per year * 20 years = $800,000

Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, which is equivalent to 20% of her annual salary. Assuming she gets paid 12 times a year (monthly), her monthly savings would be:

$100,000 per year * 0.20 = $20,000 per year
$20,000 per year / 12 months per year = $1,667 per month

However, to simplify the calculation, we can use the annual savings amount. 

Lauren's annual savings is $20,000. To calculate how many years it will take her to reach her retirement savings goal, we can divide the goal by her annual savings:

$800,000 / $20,000 per year = 40 years

Since Lauren wants to retire in 20 years, she needs to work for 40 years to reach her retirement savings goal. However, the question asks how many more years she needs to work, so we need to subtract the number of years she has already worked. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide this information. 

However, assuming she has worked for 0 years so far (i.e., she just started working), the number of years she needs to work would be 40 years. If she has worked for some years already, we would subtract those years from 40.

Assuming she has worked for 0 years so far, the answer would be:

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 240 are boys, we subtract 240 from 600 to find the number of girls.
600 - 240 = 360

"To find the average height of heels, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and divide by the total number of women.

Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so their total height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide 9,300 miles by 30 days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad plans to hike twice a day, we divide 310 miles by 2:

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per hike

However, Soledad is currently planning to hike 125 miles per time. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we subtract 125 miles from 155 miles:

155 miles - 125 miles = 30 miles

So, Soledad needs to hike 30 more miles per hike to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how many kilograms James will have left, we first need to determine how many kilograms Pierre, Paul, and Jacques will have left after Peter and Paul take their share. However, the question seems to be referring to Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, but then mentions Peter and James, who were not initially mentioned. Assuming the question meant to refer to Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, and that Peter and James are actually Pierre and Jacques, we can proceed.

Peter (Pierre) wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.
Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The total amount taken by Peter and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

So, the amount left is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

This amount will be left for Jacques (James).

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. We know she had a budget of $16 and spent $4 before buying the books. So, she had $16 - $4 = $12 left.

After buying the books, she had $2 left. This means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 / 2 = $5

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times at a rate of 51 blinks per minute. 
To do this, we divide the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:

Tate bought: 2 (male guppies) + 2 (male goldfishes) = 4 male fishes
Tate bought: 1 (female guppy) + 3 (female goldfishes) = 4 female fishes

Total male fishes: 7 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 11
Total female fishes: 12 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes:

"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys in 10 hours.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys in 10 hours.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer needs 400 toys to ship the order and still needs 20 toys after the 10-hour shift. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18.

"To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we first need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30 eggs. 

Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then Camden painted x + 12 eggs. Since together they painted 30 eggs, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.

Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now we know that Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, and the total number of eggs is 56. So Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.

"To find the total weight, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately and then add them together.

Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Since Nik wants to separate the crayons into groups of 8, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons (200) by the number of crayons per box (8):

200 ÷ 8 = 25

So, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes × 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to convert it to pounds:

400 ounces ÷ 16 = 25 pounds

"To find the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the walk, we need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add it to the time she spends on the beach.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach.

Let's denote the speed on the beach as 's'. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is '2s'.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time on the beach = 2 miles / s
Time on the sidewalk = 1 mile / 2s

We are given that the time on the beach is 40 minutes. We can use this to find the speed 's'.

40 minutes = 2 miles / s
s = 2 miles / 40 minutes
s = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time on the sidewalk:
Time on the sidewalk = 1 mile / 2s
Time on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (2 * 1/20 miles per minute)
Time on the sidewalk = 1 mile / (1/10 miles per minute)
Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk

"To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to consider the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. When 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water are mixed, the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees.

We can set up a weighted average equation to represent the situation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / (4 + 1) ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation:

(132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40

Multiplying both sides by 5:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cows brought in a week is 20 * 7 = 140. In three weeks, the total number of cows brought is 140 * 3 = 420.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In a week, the total number of chickens brought is 10 * 7 = 70. In three weeks, the total number of chickens brought is 70 * 3 = 210.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:

Total cows = Initial cows + Cows brought in three weeks
Total cows = 50 + 420
Total cows = 470

Total chickens = Initial chickens + Chickens brought in three weeks

May has 31 days. 
Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food per day. 
So, the daily cost of food for the fish is 3 * $1 = $3.
The total cost of food for the month of May is 31 days * $3 per day = $93.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to find the probability of each ticket winning and then multiply them together.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

Now, we multiply the probabilities together to find the probability that both tickets are winners:
20% * 60% = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.12 * 100 = 12%

"To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first find out how many seashells they collected in total.

Jim collected 27 seashells. 
Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, so Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
Carrey collected half of what Carlos collected, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up the total number of seashells they collected: 
27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday), so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 carrots on weekdays.

On weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, so he eats 5 * 2 = 10 carrots on weekends.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends: 20 + 10 = 30.

He sells each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The total selling price is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

"To determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs. 

Since 1 bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy needs, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy needs.

Now, to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need 5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to reach 11500 bottles. 

11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then the number of babies wearing bows.

Carla has 8 babies (octuplets). 
3/4 of them wear purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies
1/4 of them wear blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies

All blue-wearers (2 babies) and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. 
To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his original land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters, for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * 3 = $60.

The total amount he earned is $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times every time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. So, the number of face masks he uses per day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Since we want to know how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses per day by 2: 6 * 2 = 12.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

The number of eggs still hidden is 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find the total number of apartments in the last complex, we need to calculate 60% of the combined total of the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the combined total is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 
60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
Since the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, it has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments: 
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 1040 * 3 = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is 3120 * 0.40 = 1248.

- Year 7: 7 times the initial amount = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- Year 8: Let's denote the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree as x. Then, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is x - 200.
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 20 times the initial amount = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the number of fruits produced each year:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the blue rope is Y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
Blue rope = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Let's say they each gave x dollars to their little sister. Then Ronnie is left with $5 - x, and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are told that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$15 - x = $12

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get:

-x = -$3

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their little sister. Now we can find out how much is left in Ronnie's money:

$5 - $3 = $2

"To find the amount of red paint used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint that is not yellow. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is divided among red, white, and purple. 

The total amount of paint is 12 pints. Half of it is yellow, so the yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The remaining half (6 pints) is divided among red, white, and purple. Since there are equal amounts of these colors, we divide 6 pints by 3.

6 / 3 = 2 pints of red paint.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

"To find out how many pods are in the special size box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 
20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the special size box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we can find out how many pods you get per dollar by dividing the number of pods by the cost. 
120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles per dollar."
"To find the number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
   Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills is 1000 / 20 = 50.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home.
   The number of 20 dollar bills remaining is 50 - 10 = 40.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 left.

4. The value of the remaining 20 dollar bills is 20 * 20 = $400.

5. Thomas then triples his money.
   Tripling $400 gives 3 * 400 = $1200.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.
   The number of 5 dollar bills is 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then divide that by the amount used each day.

The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% on Monday. 
45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch of chalk per day (since 20% of the original 5 inches is 1 inch).

However, since the teacher only has 2.75 inches left, we should calculate 20% of the remaining chalk each day. 
20% of 2.75 is 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.

Now, we can divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
2.75 / 0.55 = 5.

However, since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk (less than 2 inches), we should calculate how many days it will take to get to 2 inches. 

Let's calculate how many days it will take to get to 2 inches from 2.75 inches:
2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches left to use.

Now, we can divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day to find out how many days the teacher has left: 
0.75 / 0.55 = 1.36 days.

Since the teacher already used 1 day (Monday), we add the days it took to get to 2.75 inches (1 day) and the days it will take to get to 2 inches (1.36 days, round down to 1 day since you can't have a fraction of a day in this context), and the days it will take to use the last 2 inches (2 / 0.55 = 3.64, round down to 3 days since you can't have a fraction of a day in this context).

So, the teacher has 1 (Monday) + 1 + 3 = 5 days.

However, the question asks how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece, so we subtract 1 from the total days since the teacher will recycle on the 5th day.

The teacher has 5 - 1 = 4 days before he has to recycle this piece.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to first find the number of students on varsity. 

There are 12 girls, and one-third of them are on varsity. One-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 

There are 12 boys, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. One-fourth of 12 is 12 / 4 = 3.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, then calculate thrice that number, and finally add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 
Thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.
Johnny bought 2 more than that, so 15 + 2 = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first find the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that had passed the expiry date.

Total gallons of milk sold = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost of milk = 4000 * $3.5 = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk.
2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Now, we multiply the gallons of sour milk by the cost per gallon to find the refund amount.
Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write an equation:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write another equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy in total, we need to divide the total amount he spent ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500). 

First, let's find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy: 
$27000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books.

Now, let's find out the total number of books he can buy: 
54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books.

Since he is distributing the books between 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3:
5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school.

"Let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree initially.
2. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket.
3. The thrown apple caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. Now, he has 1 (initial) + 4 (from the 5 that fell) = 5 apples in his pocket.
4. The thrown apple caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples.

To find the total number of apples Newton brought home, we need to add the apples he already had in his pocket (5) to the 6 apples that fell out of the tree in the last step, plus the one apple that was thrown at the tree (which is now on the ground and picked up by Newton). 

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 5 (in his pocket) + 6 (that fell out) + 1 (that was thrown) = 12.

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Kate's 6 friends will eat 6 cheese pizza slices each, so they will eat 6 x 6 = 36 cheese pizza slices in total. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

Kate's 6 friends will also eat 4 pepperoni pizza slices each, so they will eat 6 x 4 = 24 pepperoni pizza slices in total. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 snowballs / 60 minutes = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay gains snowballs is the rate at which he builds them minus the rate at which they melt: 
1/3 - 2/15 = (5 - 2) / 15 = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate to find the time it will take: 
60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

"To find Jim's current age, we need to determine their age difference. Since John is 28 now and the anniversary is for the 20th year, we subtract 20 from John's current age to find his age 20 years ago.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we divide John's age at that time by 2 to find Jim's age 20 years ago.

Jim's age 20 years ago: 8 / 2 = 4

Now, we add 20 to Jim's age 20 years ago to find his current age.

Jim's current age: 4 + 20 = 24

"To find out how many bandages they started with, we need to work backwards from the information given.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, at the end of the third day, they had 100 - 25 = 75 bandages from the order on the third day.

However, it's given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means that they had 78 - 75 = 3 bandages left from the previous days.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

On the first day, they ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages and used 38 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

Adding the bandages left at the end of the first day (12) and the bandages used on the second day (28), and then subtracting the bandages left from the previous days at the end of the third day (3), we get: 12 + 28 - 3 = 37.

"To find the cost of the scotch per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Capacity of each of John's classes = 120 * 1/8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15 = 30 students.

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's school (which is the same as his class) and the capacity of John's school.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual volume of jelly beans is 540 * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, we divide the actual volume of jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans. 
Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

In total, one bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold: 110 / 55 = 2.

"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue from selling them.

Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The cost of the eggs is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

She will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so she will sell 60 / 3 = 20 sets of eggs. The total revenue will be 20 x $1 = $20.

Rose's profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: $20 - $12 = $8.

Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

"To find the cost per stick of jerky, we first need to find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Now, we know the bag costs $15.00 and contains 30 sticks of jerky. 
To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost by the number of sticks:
$15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick

Since we need the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents by multiplying by 100:
$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that b = 5s - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so s + b = 116.

We can substitute the expression for b into the second equation: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: s = 20.

Now that we know s, we can find b: b = 5s - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

For the candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 candles. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

"To find the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the total square feet of fabric from each type of shirt and then add them together.

Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total square feet of fabric from each type of shirt:
33 + 32 + 36 = 101

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to find the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. 50% of 36 is 0.5 * 36 = 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds of the small and large sunflower to find the total number of seeds. 
36 (small sunflower) + 54 (large sunflower) = 90 seeds.

"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we multiply 18 by 3.

18 * 3 = 54

So Timothy has 54 pens. Now, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. To find out how many pens Sarah has, we divide the number of pens Timothy has by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

"To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to first find Anne's height and then Jackie's current height.

Albert is 36"" tall. 
Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne's height is 2 * 36"" = 72"".

Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie's current height is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, her height before summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

The company produces 5000 bars per day. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, the company produces:
5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35000 bars/week

In two weeks, the company will produce:
35000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70000 bars

The company sells each bar for $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks is:
70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 at the original price of $8 each. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt costs $8 and the second one costs $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 * 0.4 = $16. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying ice cream cones.

Ryan's allowance for 3 weeks is $6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 cones at $1.25 each. The total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of ice cream cones from Ryan's allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

Ryan has $13 left to spend on movie tickets. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we'll divide the amount of money he has by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

Cost of passion fruit per jar: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit per jar: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
Cost of honey per jar: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44
Total cost for 10 jars: $44 * 10 = $440

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he works in 2 weeks and the total number of cars he services.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday). In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, the total number of cars he services in 10 days is 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks are 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"To find the total number of cookies Randy has now, let's break down the information step by step.

Initially, Randy has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

Total initial cookies = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack (1 of each flavor), so:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Total cookies after snack = 8 + 3 + 4 = 15 cookies

Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)

Total cookies after lunch = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 cookies

Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 (no change)
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Total cookies after giving to friends = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 cookies

Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Total cookies after baking = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies

For the first half (6 toy soldiers), he would get $5 per toy. 
6 * $5 = $30

For the other half (6 toy soldiers), he would get $7 per toy. 
6 * $7 = $42

"To find the total number of holes the dog digs, we multiply the number of holes the dog digs per day by the number of days Nate is on vacation. 

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

When Nate gets home, the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day, and Nate fills in 9 holes per day. The net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.

To find the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day.

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks.

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. 
So, the average enrollment at Butler High School is 3/4 * 4000 = 3000 students.

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:
4000 - 3000 = 1000

"To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to first determine how many items Igor gathered. 

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. 
He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. 
He gathered the correct number of beakers, but lost some on the way, so we'll call the number of beakers he gathered 'x'. 

We know that the total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29. 
So, 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (beakers) = 29. 
8 + 16 + x = 29 
24 + x = 29 
x = 5 

Since Igor gathered the correct number of beakers initially, which is 7, and he had 5 beakers left, he lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 * 2 = 8 screws. 
Since James is putting together 4 tables, he will need 4 * 8 = 32 screws in total.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 
40 - 32 = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Aaron ran and how long it took Vanessa to run her part of the race.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and she was able to run twice as far as Aaron, Aaron must have run half the distance Vanessa did. So, Aaron ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

We are given that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that if Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, Vanessa would have taken twice as long to run the same distance. So, Vanessa would have taken 16 * 2 = 32 minutes to run 2 miles.

However, we want to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since she takes 32 minutes to run 2 miles, she would take twice as long to run 4 miles. So, Vanessa took 32 * 2 = 64 minutes to run 4 miles.

Total feet of dock: 200 feet
Feet of line needed per foot of dock: 3 feet
Total feet of line needed: 200 * 3 = 600 feet

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract that from the total feet of line needed:

Total feet of line needed: 600 feet
Feet of line already available: 6 feet
Feet of line to buy: 600 - 6 = 594 feet

So, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total amount they make per night is 6 * $15 = $90.

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total amount they make a week is 2 * $90 = $180.

"To find the answer, we need to determine the current age of John's youngest son. 

First, we find Dora's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John was 19 years old when James was born, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. To find the youngest son's current age, we subtract 32 from John's current age: 37 - 32 = 5 years.

To find the youngest son's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 5 + 3 = 8 years.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so the discount is 80% of $400, which is 0.8 * $400 = $320. The price Mark pays for the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic's labor costs $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. The total labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark pays is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation:

c + w = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

2c + 4w = 70

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:

c + 2w = 35

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':

(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
w = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'w' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

The number of chickens is 5."
