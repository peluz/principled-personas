"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins. 
So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 
She has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left. 
She sells 9 eggs at $2 each. 
So, she makes 9 x $2 = $18.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to find out how many bolts of white fiber are needed. Since it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need to divide 2 by 2 to get the number of bolts of white fiber.

2 / 2 = 1

So, it takes 1 bolt of white fiber. Now, we add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber to get the total.

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3

"To find the profit, we need to find the selling price of the house first. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs. So the total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 100% (the original value) + 150% (the increase) = 250% of the original value.

The original value was $80,000. 250% of $80,000 is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

So the selling price of the house is $200,000.

Now, let's find the profit. The profit is the selling price minus the total cost. 

Profit = Selling price - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs 3 x 3 = 9 sprints a week.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so we multiply 9 sprints by 60 meters: 9 x 60 = 540.

"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we need to first find out how many cups of feed she gives in total. 

Since Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total cups of feed needed per day is 20 x 3 = 60 cups.

We know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the total cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total cups of feed needed per day. 

60 - 40 = 20

"To find the total cost, we need to find the cost of the first 8 glasses and the cost of the second 8 glasses. 

The first 8 glasses cost $5 each, so 8 x $5 = $40.

The second 8 glasses cost 60% of $5 each. 60% of $5 is 0.6 x $5 = $3. So, the second 8 glasses cost 8 x $3 = $24.

The total cost is $40 + $24 = $64.

"Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep. 
Now, let's add the number of sheep in all three places: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

"Carla can download 2 GB per minute. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB. So Carla downloaded 80 GB before the restart. 

It took her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download 80 GB. 

Then the computer restarted for 20 minutes. 

After the restart, Carla has to download the whole 200 GB again. It will take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download the whole file. 

So the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to find the distance he traveled in the 4 hours after he turned around.

He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't move at all.

Then he drove for half an hour at 30 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 0.5
Distance = 15 miles

Then he drove for the remaining time at 80 mph. The remaining time is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 * 1.5
Distance = 120 miles

So, the total distance he traveled in the 4 hours after he turned around is 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

But we also need to find the distance he traveled before he turned around. He drove for 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 3
Distance = 180 miles

So, the total distance he traveled is 180 + 135 = 315 miles. But this is not the answer we are looking for. We want to know how far he is from home.

Since he drove 180 miles before he turned around, and then drove 135 miles back, he is still 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home.

"Eliza worked 45 hours this week. She gets paid $10 per hour for the first 40 hours. So for the first 40 hours, she gets 40 x $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours more than 40 hours. For these extra hours, she gets 1.2 times her regular rate. 1.2 x $10 = $12 per hour. So for the extra 5 hours, she gets 5 x $12 = $60.

"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. 
In the second month, the program had 3 times as many downloads as the first month, so 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. 
In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so 180 - (30% of 180) = 180 - (0.3 x 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads. 
Now, we add the downloads from all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and add them together.

3 dozen donuts cost $68 per dozen, so 3 x $68 = $204.
2 dozen mini cupcakes cost $80 per dozen, so 2 x $80 = $160.
6 dozen mini cheesecakes cost $55 per dozen, so 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the total cost and the total earnings.

The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree. So, the total cost after 'x' years will be $90 + $3x.

Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the total earnings after 'x' years will be $1.5 * 7 * x = $10.5x.

Now, we need to find out when the total earnings will be more than the total cost. We can set up an equation:

$10.5x > $90 + $3x

Subtract $3x from both sides:

$7.5x > $90

Now, divide both sides by $7.5:

x > $90 / $7.5
x > 12

So, it will take more than 12 years for Carlos to start earning money. Since we can't have a fraction of a year, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money.

"Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She had x - x/3 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold 2 more to the red house, so she had x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

She had (x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left.

We know she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 = 10

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3x - x - 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

So Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the profit, we need to calculate the increase in value for each option.

For the jewelry: 
Original price = $5,000
Increase = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
New price = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets: 
Original price = $8,000
Increase = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
New price = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, let's calculate the profit for each option:
Profit from jewelry = New price - Original price = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
Profit from electronic gadgets = New price - Original price = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose the jewelry.

She walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in 1 hour. So she walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours.

The total distance is 12 miles. She has walked 6 miles. So the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. She has walked 2 hours. To get an average speed of 4 miles per hour for 12 miles, she needs to walk the total distance in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours. So she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left.

She needs to walk 6 miles in 1 hour. So the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is 6 miles per hour.

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6
Raymond's age = 31 + 6
Raymond's age = 37

John bought 10 red ties at $60 each. To find out how much he spent on red ties, we need to multiply 10 by $60.

10 * $60 = $600

John spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties. To find out how much he spent in total, we need to add $200 and $600.

$200 + $600 = $800

There are 12 eggs in a dozen. Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen. So, if he sells 252 eggs per day, we need to divide 252 by 12 to find out how many dozens he sells per day.

252 / 12 = 21

Now, we know Lloyd sells 21 dozens per day. Since he sells each dozen for $2, we multiply 21 by 2.

21 * 2 = 42

So, Lloyd makes $42 per day. To find out how much he makes per week, we multiply $42 by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

Total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. 
12 car tires at $40 each is 12 x $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday is $480

The city is 42 miles across.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 3 miles are there in 42 miles. 
42 miles / 3 miles = 14

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each group of 3 miles, we multiply the number of groups by 10 minutes.
14 * 10 minutes = 140 minutes

"Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. A quarter is 1/4. 1000 * 1/4 is 250. So Poppy places 250 pieces.

Now there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. A third is 1/3. 750 * 1/3 is 250. So her mom places 250 pieces.

Now there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The outer dimensions are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

New length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
New width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
New height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

Now we find the inner volume of one box by multiplying the new length, width, and height:
Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"Let's break it down:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Total hours from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Total hours watched: 7 hours
Hours watched on Wednesday: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can find the number of episodes by dividing the hours by 0.5:
1.5 / 0.5 = 3

"Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. He wants to bake twice as many this year, so he wants to bake 2x cookies.

But he actually baked 15 more than he meant to, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.

Then he dropped 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon. So for 10 gallons, the cashback will be 10 x $.20 = $2.00.

First, let's find out how many feet she rowed in 64 seconds. We know she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. So, we need to find out how many groups of 16 seconds are in 64 seconds. 

64 / 16 = 4. So, there are 4 groups of 16 seconds in 64 seconds. 

Now, we know she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. So, in 64 seconds, she rows 4 x 20 = 80 feet.

We know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. So, we need to find out how many groups of 10 feet are in 80 feet.

80 / 10 = 8. So, there are 8 groups of 10 feet in 80 feet.

The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

"To find the profit, we need to find the cost price and the selling price. 

The cost price of 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost price of 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost price is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the price of lumber has gone up by 50%, the selling price will be 150% of the cost price.
The selling price of 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 is 10 * $10 * 1.5 = $150.
The selling price of 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 is 5 * $16 * 1.5 = $120.
The total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price.

Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3 = $30769 (round to the nearest dollar)

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. His salary increased by 40%, so we multiply his old salary by 1.4 (100% + 40% = 140% = 1.4).

Adrien's new salary = $40000 * 1.4 = $56000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Her salary also increased, but we don't know by how much. However, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than hers four years ago, and it is still 30% higher than hers now. So, we can find Lylah's new salary by dividing Adrien's new salary by 1.3.

Lylah's new salary = $56000 / 1.3 = $43077 (round to the nearest dollar)

Now, we can find the total salary the two were receiving four years later by adding their salaries.

Julia bought a package of spoons, but we don't know how many. Then her husband bought 5 more spoons. So now Julia has the spoons from the package she bought plus 5 more. 

While making the stew, Julia used 3 spoons. So now she has the spoons from the package she bought plus 5 more, minus 3. 

When she went to set the table, she had 12 spoons. So the spoons from the package she bought plus 5 more, minus 3, equals 12. 

Let's use a number to represent the spoons from the package Julia bought. We can call it x. Then the equation is x + 5 - 3 = 12. 

To solve for x, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation. This gives us x + 5 = 15.

"To find the total length, we need to find the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

First, we need to convert the length of the rolls and croissants to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot. 

The rolls are 4 inches long, so we divide 4 by 12 to get 1/3 feet per roll. 
The croissants are 6 inches long, so we divide 6 by 12 to get 1/2 feet per croissant.

Now, we multiply the number of each baked good by its length in feet:
- Rolls: 300 * 1/3 = 100 feet
- Croissants: 120 * 1/2 = 60 feet
- Baguettes: 60 * 2 = 120 feet

Now, we add the lengths together: 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet

Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Total bananas needed per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

"To find out who ran the most, we need to find out how much each person ran.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, running back and forth is like running 2 times the length of the field. So, Blake ran 15 x 2 x 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 2 x 100 = 200 yards. Then she ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Running to the 40-yard line and back is like running 2 x 40 = 80 yards. So, Kelly ran 200 + 34 x 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2920 yards. So, Blake ran the most. To find out how much farther Blake ran than Kelly, we need to subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance.

"To find the price after 36 months, we need to find the price after 18 months (9 increases of 2 months each) and then multiply it by the increase for the last 18 months.

The price increases by 20% every 2 months. 
20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4.
So the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.2 * $24 = $4.80.
So the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.2 * $28.80 = $5.76.
So the price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.2 * $34.56 = $6.91.
So the price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.47, which is 0.2 * $41.47 = $8.29.
So the price after 10 months is $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.76, which is 0.2 * $49.76 = $9.95.
So the price after 12 months is $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71, which is 0.2 * $59.71 = $11.94.
So the price after 14 months is $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $71.65, which is 0.2 * $71.65 = $14.33.
So the price after 16 months is $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98.

After another 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $85.98, which is 0.2 * $85.98 = $17.20.
So the price after 18 months is $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18.

After another 18 months, the price will increase by the same amount again.
So the price after 36 months is $103.18 * 2 = $206.36.

Since he got the award on the first day of the year, he will get the raise for the whole year. His new total salary for the year is:
$2100 x 52 = $109,200

Now, we add the award to his new salary:
$109,200 + $5000 = $114,200

"Josie has 10 acres of farm. Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes. So, 10 acres will produce 10 x 5 = 50 tons of grapes.

"Carl ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch. There are 7 days in a week. He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. So, he used 7 x 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week. He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. So, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet. He used 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

He used 8 slices of cheese for dinner.

Now, let's add all the slices of cheese he used: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31

"Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. That's 22 + 10 = 32 pens. 

She bought 6 bags of blue pens. There were 9 pens in each bag of blue pens. So she got 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She bought 2 bags of red pens. There were 6 pens in each bag of red pens. So she got 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add all the pens together. 32 + 54 + 12 = 98.

"To find the score Brinley needs, we need to first find the total score she needs for 5 tests to get an average of 93. 

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will consider the 5 tests after removing the lowest score. 

The average is the total score divided by the number of tests. So, the total score for 5 tests is 93 * 5 = 465.

Now, let's find the total score of the 4 highest tests Brinley has so far. 
The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71. 
So, the total score of the 4 highest tests is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

Now, we need to find the total score of the 5 tests after removing the lowest score. 
The total score for 5 tests is 465. The total score of the 4 highest tests is 367. 
So, the score of the 5th test is 465 - 367 = 98.

The answer is: 98"
"Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. That's 5 x 4 = 20 times. He rode 25 kilometers each time, so that's 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers.

Then he rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. That's 2 x 3 = 6 times. He rode 60 kilometers each time, so that's 6 x 60 = 360 kilometers.

To find the total, we add 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the weight of the bag of candy, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples.

The weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g.

The weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.

The total weight of the bag of candy is 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes. 
On Tuesday, she bought 3 times that number, so 3 x 4 = 12 cakes. 
On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday, so 5 x 12 = 60 cakes. 
Now, we add all the cakes together: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To find the cost of each cup, we need to first find the total cost of 20 dozen cups. 

First, let's find the cost of half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates is 6 plates. If each plate costs $6000, then 6 plates will cost 6 x $6000 = $36000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Since 1 dozen is 12, 20 dozen is 20 x 12 = 240 cups. 

Now, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
Cost of each cup = $34800 / 240 = $145.

"To find out how much money Sara needs, we need to add the cost of the jacket and the shoes. 
The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 x $20 = $40. 
So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 and she earns $5 each time she babysits. 
She babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 x $5 = $20 from babysitting. 
Now, she has $10 + $20 = $30.

She still needs $70 - $30 = $40 to buy the jacket and shoes.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. 
To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns each time ($4). 
$40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's say Jerry has x red chickens. Then he has x + 2 white chickens.

The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so x red chickens produce 3x eggs a day.

The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so x + 2 white chickens produce 5(x + 2) eggs a day.

Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, so 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42.

3x + 5x + 10 = 42

8x + 10 = 42

8x = 32

x = 4

So Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to find the distance around the park and then divide it by his speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find the distance around it. To do that, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides. 

The park is 1.5 miles by 6 miles. There are two sides that are 1.5 miles and two sides that are 6 miles. 

So, the distance around the park is: 
1.5 + 1.5 + 6 + 6 = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at 3 miles/hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we need to divide the distance by his speed.

15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers. 
The total number of customers for the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250 customers. 
The total number of customers by the third day was 500. 
So, the number of customers on the third day is 500 - 250 = 250.

"Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, each pool will lose 4 x 4 = 16 gallons of water.

So, the small pool now has x - 16 gallons of water, and the big pool now has 2x - 16 gallons of water.

We are told that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
64 - 16 = 4x - 2x
48 = 2x
x = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons of water.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to find out the total cost of the shoes and the belt. 

The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. 
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Total cost = $352.00
Hourly wage = $8.00
Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours = 44

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200
So the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she needs to pay.
$2200 - $1980 = $220

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 68 + 17 is 85. So Brianna scored 85 points.

Now we know how many points Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored. We can add them up: 68 + 44 + 85 is 197.

The total number of points is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total: 251 - 197 is 54.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to know the total number of cards and the number of water type cards.

James had 40 water type cards, but he lost 8, so he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

He had 20 grass type cards, but he bought 14 more, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of all the cards: 30 fire type + 34 grass type + 32 water type = 96 cards.

The chance of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards: 32 / 96 = 0.3333.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.3333 * 100 = 33.33.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to find out how many students went out through exits A and B first.

The number of students who went out through exit A is 30% of 1000. 
30% of 1000 is 0.3 * 1000 = 300.

So, 300 students went out through exit A. 
The remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. 
3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420.

"Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being penpals with 2 of them. So, he is penpals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of the 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, Mike writes 2 * 3 = 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so Mike writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes writing a week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, Mike spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours writing a week.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 french fries initially.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
4. Ginger gave Griffin some fries, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call it x. So now Griffin has 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than Kyle's 5 fries, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

"To find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums, we need to subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. 
32 (snails in the bigger aquarium) - 4 (snails in the smaller aquarium) = 28

The difference is 28. It is also twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, let's call the number of fish in each aquarium 'x'. Then the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference (28) is twice the amount of fish (2x), so we can write an equation: 
28 = 2 * 2x
28 = 4x

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 28 / 4
x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours the makeup artist worked and then multiply it by the hourly rate.

The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 days a week. So, in a week, she works 6 * 4 = 24 hours.
The movie takes 5 weeks, so the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

Since the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30,000 and subtract it from the total cost.
10% of $30,000 is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.
So, the discount is $3,000.

The final amount Jean paid is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Total cookies Sue ate = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.
Total cookies her sister ate = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Total calories Sue consumed = 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.

In total, Rick killed 25 + 48 = 73 animals.

For small holes, it takes 3 minutes per hole. Matthew digs 30 small holes, so the total time for small holes is 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.

For large holes, it takes 10 minutes per hole. Matthew digs 15 large holes, so the total time for large holes is 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for small and large holes: 90 + 150 = 240 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 240 minutes to hours. 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100 spots.

Now, we need to add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas. 
2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots.

Total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows = 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Now, subtract the total stars in 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in 5-star rows.

There are 5 members in the household, so the household eats 0.4 x 5 = 2 kg of rice per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the household eats 2 x 7 = 14 kg of rice per week.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount of rice the household eats per week (14 kg).

Now, we need to find the tax. 
20% of $30,000 is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000

Axel has 50 + 80 = 130 pesos.
Anna has 100 + 120 = 220 pesos.

Together they have 130 + 220 = 350 pesos.

"To find the profit, we need to find out how much money Millie makes and subtract the cost of supplies.

Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, she makes 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so she makes 36 x $1 = $36.

The cost of supplies is $18. 

Her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

She sells 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups. So, she will be open for 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to figure out what 3/5 of the land is and then add it to the 12.8 hectares he has left.

Let's say the total land he had at first is x hectares. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he sold 3/5 * x hectares.

He has 2/5 of his land left, which is 12.8 hectares. 

So, 2/5 * x = 12.8

To find x, we need to multiply both sides by 5/2.

x = 12.8 * 5/2
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

Let's say Betty has 5x popsicles and Sam has 6x popsicles.

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: 
x = 15

Now we know that Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles and Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

Mel uses 900 watts of energy per hour. He uses it for 8 hours a day. So, in a day, he uses 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watts.

Now, if he reduces the time by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. So, in a day, he will use 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watts.

The amount of energy he saves in a day is 7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts.

Now, we need to convert watts to kilowatts. 1 kilowatt is 1000 watts. So, 4500 watts is 4500 / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatts.

Now, we need to find out how much energy he saves in 30 days. He saves 4.5 kilowatts a day. So, in 30 days, he will save 4.5 kilowatts * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

Joanne gathered half the amount of apples from the shortest trees as she did from the tallest trees. Half of 30 is 15, so Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathered 3 x 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Now we know how many apples Joanne and her sister gathered from the tallest and shortest trees. We can add these numbers together to find the total number of apples they gathered from the tallest and shortest trees.

Joanne gathered 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees. Her sister gathered 60 + 45 = 105 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide $150 by $1.5 to find out how many cards he sold. 

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

But we know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the cards he sold are 2/3 of his total cards. 

Let's call the total number of cards 'x'. Then 2/3 of 'x' is 100. 

To find 'x', we can multiply 100 by 3 and then divide by 2.

(100 * 3) / 2 = 300 / 2 = 150.

So Kenny started with 150 cards.

"The caterer prepared for 36 guests. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18. So he prepared 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs for the 18 guests who might want two, and 1 hotdog for the other 18 guests. That's 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog. That's 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs. But the caterer only had 54 hotdogs. So he was short 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

Since each guest who didn't get a second hotdog was short 1 hotdog, the number of guests who didn't get a second hotdog is 26.

"Indras has 6 letters in her name. 
Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 
Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters. 
The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to add the cost of the pot and pans, the mixing bowls, and the utensils. 

The pot and pans cost $120.00, the mixing bowls cost $20.00, and the 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 x $5.00 = $25.00. 

Now, let's add them together: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to find 20% of $165.00. To do this, we multiply $165.00 by 0.20. 
$165.00 x 0.20 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract $33.00 from $165.00 to get the final cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. So, she has $2 + $16 = $18.

Now, we need to subtract the money Dora has from the total cost. $19 - $18 = $1.

"To find the cost per serving, we need to find the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The onions cost $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

It takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater. Since it takes Bernadette 4 times as long as Wayne, we multiply 4 by 4.

So it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater. 

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to find the difference between their travel times and add 5 minutes. 
16 - 4 = 12 minutes

Then we add 5 minutes to that.

We also know the area is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is length x width. So, we can find the width by dividing the area by the length: 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now we know the length (9 feet) and width (40 feet). The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 x (length + width). So, the perimeter is 2 x (9 + 40) = 2 x 49 = 98 feet.

Jon took 40 minutes for the swim. James finished the swim 10% faster. 10% of 40 is 4, so James took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes for the swim.

Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (80 minutes) for the bike ride. James took 5 minutes longer, so James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes for the bike ride.

Jon took 50 minutes for the run. We don't know how long James took for the run yet.

The total time Jon took for the triathlon is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James took 170 + 10 = 180 minutes for the triathlon.

Now we know James took 36 minutes for the swim and 85 minutes for the bike ride. So James took 36 + 85 = 121 minutes for the swim and bike ride.

Distance = 16 miles

The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile. So for 16 miles, it eats:
16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay

Each bail of hay costs $3. So 8 bails of hay cost:

"To find the cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and there are 2 people (Tom and his wife), so the total cost of the plane tickets is:
$5000 x 2 = $10,000

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. To find the new price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500:
20% of $1500 = 0.20 x $1500 = $300

So the new price of the hotel is:
$1500 + $300 = $1800 per day

They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost of the hotel is:
$1800 x 3 = $5400

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
$10,000 + $5400 = $15,400

He has 4 horses, so all the horses eat 10 x 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.

For 5 days, the horses will eat 40 x 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

The cost of the first venue is $200 + $5x. 
The cost of the second venue is $25x.

We want to find out when they are equal, so we set them equal to each other.

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now, let's solve for 'x'. 

$200 = $25x - $5x
$200 = $20x

Now, divide both sides by $20.

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

So, x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43.

Combine like terms: 2x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43.
Combine like terms again: 3x/2 + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x/2 = 36.

Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 72.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 24.

Now we know Bodhi found 24 insects. 
David found half of that, so David found 24/2 = 12 insects.
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

So in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years. 55 - 8 = 47.

Now we know Jame is 22 years old and his cousin is 47 years old. To find the difference in their ages, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age. 47 - 22 = 25.

"To find out how much one monitor cost, we need to know the total cost of the printer and the computer first. 

The computer cost $1,100. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

The total cost of everything Errol bought is $2,400. So the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys (600) plus four times as many seashells as the boys (4 * 600 = 2400). So the girls brought 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, each girl brought 3000 / 10 = 300 shells.

April has 30 days. The first half of the month is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in total. Let's say he saves x dollars each day in the first half. Then he will save 2x dollars each day in the second half.

In the first half, he saves 15x dollars. In the second half, he saves 15 * 2x = 30x dollars.

The total amount he saves is 15x + 30x = 45x dollars. This should be equal to $1125.

45x = 1125

To find x, we divide both sides by 45.

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

So Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half. In the second half, he saves twice as much, which is 2 * 25 = 50 dollars.

Each box is $100.00 and is 10% off. 10% of $100 is $10. So the discount is $10. 

$100 - $10 = $90. So each box costs $90.

2 boxes will cost 2 x $90 = $180.

There are 90 single use contacts in 1 box. So 2 boxes will have 2 x 90 = 180 contacts.

Now we know the total cost of 2 boxes is $180 and there are 180 contacts. 

To find the cost of each contact, we divide the total cost by the number of contacts. 

$180 / 180 = $1.

So each contact will cost $1."
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to find out how much each of them earned.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. So Jill worked 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Jill gets $10 per hour. So Jill earned 3 x $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday. So John worked 2 x 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday. So John worked 3 x 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.

John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours in total.

John gets $10 per hour. So John earned 7 x $10 = $70.

Now we need to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill. To do this, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings.

$70 - $30 = $40

"To find out how many calories Hannah burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running. 

She did aerobics for 2 hours, and it burns 500 calories per hour. So, 2 x 500 = 1000 calories.

She did running for 1 hour, and it burns 600 calories per hour. So, 1 x 600 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, for every 200 calories, she needs 100 ml of water. So, we need to divide 1600 by 200 to find out how many times 200 goes into 1600. 1600 / 200 = 8.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we multiply 8 by 100. 8 x 100 = 800.

"Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is x. 
Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x. 
Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:
0.99x + x + 1.01x = 4500

Combine like terms:
2.99x + 0.01x = 4500
3x = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 1500

Now we know the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. 
The number of red jelly beans is 0.99x = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.
The number of green jelly beans is 1.01x = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30.

So the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

He has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15).

Now, we know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women. So, we need to find 60% of 25.

60% of 25 is 0.6 x 25 = 15

Since 15 are women, the rest of the riders who can stay upright are men. So, we subtract 15 from 25.

25 - 15 = 10

"The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000. 
The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times the price of a diamond Jewell. 
So, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 * $2000 = $1600. 
The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell. 
So, the price of a silver Jewell is $1600 - $400 = $1200. 
The total price for all three jewels is $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800.

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the 75 miles that Bob is ahead.

Tom is driving 70 miles per hour, and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour. So, Tom is driving 15 miles per hour faster than Bob.

This means that every hour, Tom will get 15 miles closer to Bob.

To cover 75 miles at 15 miles per hour, we need to divide 75 by 15.

75 ÷ 15 = 5

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to find out how many classes he can attend before the cost per class is more than $10.

The total cost of the classes is $60. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6. This is less than $10.

If Manny misses some classes, the cost per class will be more. Let's say he misses x classes. Then, he attends 10 - x classes.

The cost per class is $60 / (10 - x). We want to find the maximum value of x such that the cost per class is less than or equal to $10.

$60 / (10 - x) ≤ $10

To solve this, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x).

$60 ≤ $10(10 - x)

$60 ≤ $100 - $10x

$10x ≤ $100 - $60

$10x ≤ $40

x ≤ $40 / $10

x ≤ 4

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes.

Now, we can use the first equation to express G in terms of S: G = 20 - S.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get: 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get: 4S + 40 - 2S = 70.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to find the time it took for each half and add them together.

Mowing half the lawn in turtle mode: Since it takes 1 hour to mow the whole lawn in turtle mode, it will take half an hour to mow half the lawn. Half an hour is 30 minutes.

Mowing half the lawn in rabbit mode: Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the whole lawn in rabbit mode, it will take half of 40 minutes to mow half the lawn. Half of 40 minutes is 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time for each half: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's say the age of one triplet is x. Then the age of one twin is x + 7. There are 2 twins and 3 triplets. 

So, the total age is x + (x + 7) + x + x + x = 44. 

Combine the x's: 5x + 7 = 44. 

Now subtract 7 from both sides: 5x = 37. 

Now divide by 5: x = 7.4 (round down to 7 since you can't have a fraction of a year, but we will use 7.4 for calculation)

Now we know one triplet is 7.4 years old. One twin is 7.4 + 7 = 14.4 years old.

One twin is 14 years old."

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. 
5 lollipops cost 5 x $0.40 = $2.00. 
So, 4 candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 
The cost of 1 candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. 
10 lollipops cost 10 x $0.40 = $4.00. 
10 candies cost 10 x $0.30 = $3.00.

"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to find out the total bill first. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, and there are 2 vaccines, so the total cost of the vaccines is 2 x $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then the heartworm check is 60% of x, or 0.6x.

The total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check, so we can write an equation: 
x = $40 + 0.6x

To solve for x, we need to get all the x's on one side. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:
0.4x = $40

Now we can divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x:
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25

In 30 days, he will chew 4 x 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces of gum.

"To find out how many smores are needed, we need to add the smores the kids and adults will eat. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so 9 x 2 = 18 smores. 
6 adults want 1 smore each, so 6 x 1 = 6 smores. 
18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Each sleeve makes 8 smores, so we need to divide 24 by 8. 
24 / 8 = 3 sleeves.

There are 3 sleeves in a box, so we need 3 / 3 = 1 box, but since 3 / 3 is exactly 1, we don't have any extra sleeves for more smores, and we can't have a fraction of a sleeve. So we need to round up to the nearest whole number of boxes. Since 3 sleeves is exactly 1 box, we still need 1 box, but if we had 4 sleeves needed, we would need 2 boxes. But we don't need to round up in this case.

"To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of all the pizzas.

The two pizzas cost 30 dollars, so together they cost 30 + 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract 60 dollars from the total cost of all the pizzas, which is 64 dollars. 
64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we need to divide 4 dollars by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.
4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's 3 x 5 = 15 times.

They ride twice the times on 2 other days. So they ride 3 x 2 = 6 times a day on those 2 days. That's 6 x 2 = 12 times.

In total, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times a week.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish initially. He added 17 more fish to his pond. 

Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x. Then the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x.

Now, he has 3 + (17 - x) orange fish and 4 + x white fish.

We know that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. So we can set up an equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2 * (4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:
20 - x = 8 + 2x
20 - 8 = 3x
12 = 3x
x = 4

So Bob bought 4 white fish.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to find out how much gas it uses per week and multiply it by the price of gas.

First, let's find out the total distance Andy travels per week. He goes to work from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days. Since it's a round trip (to work and back home), the total distance per day is 5 miles x 2 = 10 miles. 

Now, let's find out the total distance per week. 10 miles x 5 days = 50 miles.

Now, let's find out how much gas Andy's car uses per week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so we divide the total distance by the fuel efficiency. 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

Now, let's find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week. The price of gas is $3/gallon, so we multiply the gas used per week by the price of gas. 5 gallons x $3/gallon = $15.

45 - 33 = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. So, we need to find out how many degrees Carson needs to heat the house.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the total number of employees will be:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in the first month) = 220

240 + 20 (new employees in the third month) = 260

So, after three months, the company has 260 employees.

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month, we multiply the number of employees by their salary:
260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000 per month

Since we want to find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so Sally earns $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Billy earns $11.50 per hour and Sally earns $10.50 per hour. The difference is $11.50 - $10.50 = $1 per hour.

Now, we know she has 14 stuffed animals. If she wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we need to find out how many animals will be 100% and then find 30% of that number.

Let's say the total number of animals is x. 
30% of x is the number of goats she needs to buy. 
Since she already has 14 animals, the number of goats she needs to buy plus 14 should be equal to x.

Let's say the number of goats she needs to buy is y. 
y + 14 = x

We know that y is 30% of x. 
y = 0.3x

Now we can put this in the first equation.

Now we need to solve for x. 
0.3x - 0.3x + 0.7x = x - 0.3x
0.7x = 14
x = 14 / 0.7
x = 20

Now we know that the total number of animals should be 20. 
Since she already has 14 animals, she needs to buy 20 - 14 = 6 animals.

"To find out how much Boris produces the fourth week, we need to know how much he has produced so far and subtract that from the total.

Boris produces 8,000 bars the first week. 
The second week, he produces half of 8,000, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000.
The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000.

Now, let's add up how much he has produced so far: 
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000.

"To find out how much Iris spent, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add up the cost of the hair, manicure, and pedicure: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to find out how much money she will get from selling the rope and how much the new rope will cost.

Sarah's rope is 20 meters long. She will sell it for $2 a meter. So, she will get 20 x $2 = $40.

The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. Since Sarah's old rope is 20 meters long, she will need a new rope of the same length. So, the new rope will cost 20 x $1.5 = $30.

Now, let's find out how much money Sarah will have left over. She will get $40 from selling the rope and she will spend $30 on the new rope. So, she will have $40 - $30 = $10 left over.

3 times 8 is 24. 

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Melanie to be 24 years old.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10, so each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.

The chicken costs twice as much as the bacon, so each pack of chicken costs $2 x 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, so the total cost of the chicken is 6 x $4 = $24.

The strawberries cost $4 each, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12.

The apples cost half the price of the strawberries, so each apple costs $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

"Let's break this down. 

Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it also has a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

Let's say her usual concert is x minutes long. Then, the final concert without the encore would be 2x minutes long. 

Since the final concert has a 15-minute encore, we can say that 2x + 15 = 65.

Now, let's solve for x. 
2x + 15 = 65
2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50
x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Two-thirds of 75 is (2/3) * 75 = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants. 
75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's. Since Joe paid $6, that means she mowed Joe's lawn once. So she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. If Joe paid $6 for 1 time, then Kamala paid 3 x $6 = $18.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times. If Joe paid $6 for 1 time, then Alba paid 5 x $6 = $30.

So, Tasha made $6 from Joe, $18 from Kamala, and $30 from Alba. That's $6 + $18 + $30 = $54 from mowing lawns.

Tasha made $80 in total. If she made $54 from mowing lawns, then she made $80 - $54 = $26 from lemonade sales.

"To find out how much more money Fern will make, we need to find out how much money each machine will make in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. 
There are 24 hours in a day, so it makes 60 x 24 = 1440 widgets a day.
There are 30 days in a month, so it makes 1440 x 30 = 43200 widgets a month.
Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 will make 43200 x 6 = $259200 a month.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. 
There are 24 hours in a day, so it makes 45 x 24 = 1080 widgets a day.
There are 30 days in a month, so it makes 1080 x 30 = 32400 widgets a month.
Each widget sells for $6, so the WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32400 x 6 = $194400 a month.

Now, let's find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 will make compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. That's 17 hours. 

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for 12 hours. Cameron will pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. 

He stayed 17 hours, so he stayed 5 hours more than 12 hours. The hotel charges 70 pesos for every hour after 12 hours. 5 hours x 70 pesos per hour is 350 pesos.

So Cameron will pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

If Cameron paid for 24 hours, he would pay 1600 pesos. 

To find out how much money Cameron saved, we need to subtract the amount he paid from the amount he would have paid for 24 hours. 
1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to find out how much each sheep needs first. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds. Twice that is 5 x 2 = 10. 3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now we know each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 7 pounds. There are 15 goats and 12 sheep. 

15 goats x 5 pounds = 75 pounds for the goats.
12 sheep x 7 pounds = 84 pounds for the sheep.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left.

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils.

Now he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

Each pen costs 25 dollars, so he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.

"To find the time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break it down into parts.

First, James swims 60% of the distance. 60% of 20 miles is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

After that, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. He swims at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time it took him to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

So Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 
That's x - 10 points.

We know the total points is 45. 
So x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45.

Combine like terms:

"To find out how much Katherine will spend, we need to find out how many petunias and sweet potato vines she needs in total. 

She has 5 baskets. In each basket, she wants 3 petunias. So, she needs 5 x 3 = 15 petunias. 
She also wants 2 sweet potato vines in each basket. So, she needs 5 x 2 = 10 sweet potato vines.

Now, let's find out how much the petunias cost. Each petunia costs $3.00. She needs 15 petunias. So, the petunias cost 15 x $3.00 = $45.00.

Now, let's find out how much the sweet potato vines cost. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50. She needs 10 sweet potato vines. So, the sweet potato vines cost 10 x $2.50 = $25.00.

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines. The total cost is $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first find out how much soil they used for the sunflowers and carnations.

They planted 4 sunflowers. Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. So, 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of soil for the sunflowers.

They planted 10 carnations. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. So, 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil for the carnations.

They used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil for the sunflowers and carnations.

They had 30 pounds of soil. They used 27 pounds. So, they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, they can plant 3 roses.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to first find out how much money she sets aside each month for shoes. 

25% of $2,000 is 0.25 * $2,000 = $500. 

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply $500 by 12 to get the total amount she sets aside in a year. 
$500 * 12 = $6,000.

Now, we divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many shoes she can buy. 
$6,000 / $1,000 = 6.

"To peel 90 shrimp, it will take Emily 90 / 6 = 15 minutes. 

To saute 90 shrimp, it will take Emily 90 / 30 * 10 = 30 minutes.

So, to peel and cook 90 shrimp, it will take Emily 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

"The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Then it was turned up to high and it cools the room 3 degrees an hour. It ran on high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

So in total, the air conditioner cooled the room 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After the air conditioner was turned off, the room warmed up 2 degrees an hour for 2 hours, so it warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

So the final temperature was 18 - 4 = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet the second time, and then subtract 75 years.

Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet the second time.

Since the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. So Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"Buford writes a check for the electric bill once a month. There are 12 months in a year, so that's 12 checks.

He also writes a check for the gas bill once a month, so that's 12 more checks.

He writes a check to the church twice a month, so that's 2 x 12 = 24 checks.

He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means 4 times a year, so that's 4 checks.

Now, let's add all the checks together: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

"The second plane makes 44 trips in a day. Since this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips in a day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece 88 * 3/4 = 66 times.

The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22. These are split equally between France and Germany, so the first plane goes to France 22 / 2 = 11 times.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. 
There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to find the average age of the group first. We know the total age of the children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4 years old. 

Let's add the ages of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7. 

Now, we subtract 7 from the total age to find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred: 20 - 7 = 13.

We know Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. The total age is 20, and there are 4 children. 

The average age is 20 / 4 = 5. 

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

Now, we know the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, and Helene is 10 years old. 

The age of Wilfred is 13 - 10 = 3.

"Let's say the size of each kid's slice is x. Then the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

There are 4 kids, so the total size of the kids' slices is 4x.
There are 2 adults, so the total size of the adults' slices is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total size of all the slices is 4x + 4x = 8x.

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is the size of their slice divided by the total size of all the slices, multiplied by 100.

So, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is (2x / 8x) * 100 = 25%

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left, we need to find out how many hours he spends on rounds and appointments. 

He has 9 inpatients and each inpatient takes 20 minutes. So, 9 x 20 minutes is 180 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

He has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, 10 x 30 minutes is 300 minutes. 300 minutes is 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

So, he spends 3 hours on rounds and 5 hours on appointments. That's 3 + 5 = 8 hours.

He works 9 hours at the clinic. So, he has 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records.

Baking the cake takes 30 minutes. 
Cooling the cake takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 
Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.

Total time to make the cake is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

We need to convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes. 
180 minutes is 3 hours.

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."

"To find the total earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total earnings per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

The dance studio is rented 3 days a week. The cost per session is $25 plus $1.50 per student. There are 10 students. 

Cost per session = $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total earnings per week = $40 * 3 = $120 per week.

There are 4 weeks in a month. So, the total earnings in a month = $120 * 4 = $480.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to multiply the total population by 3/5. 

3/5 of 50 is (3/5) * 50 = (3 * 50) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30.

So, there are 30 female porcupines. 

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. In a year, there are 12 months. 

So, each female porcupine will give birth to 4 * 12 = 48 babies in a year.

Since there are 30 female porcupines, the total number of babies born in a year will be 30 * 48 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the initial population (50) plus the number of babies born (1440). 

So, the total number of porcupines after a year will be 50 + 1440 = 1490.

"To find out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped, we need to do some math.

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons. 

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity. 
1/4 of 18000 is 18000 / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. 
3/4 of 4500 is 4500 * 3 / 4 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, Wanda and Ms. B pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day. 
2/3 of 4500 is 4500 * 2 / 3 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. 
1/3 of 3375 is 3375 / 3 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, Wanda and Ms. B pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

In total, Wanda and Ms. B pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons. 
So, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break this down step by step.

The power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours. So, the total percentage lost in 5 hours is 9% x 5 = 45%.

Then, the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours. So, the total percentage lost in 3 hours is 7% x 3 = 21%.

The total percentage lost is 45% + 21% = 66%.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first find out how much money he has left.

Jamaar bought 3 peaches for $.5 each, so 3 x .5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears for $.5 each, so 4 x .5 = $2
He bought 2 kiwis for $1 each, so 2 x 1 = $2
He bought 5 apples for $.75 each, so 5 x .75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the money he spent: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar had $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $.75 left.

Now, let's see how many plums he can buy with $.75. Plums cost $.25 each, so we can divide $.75 by $.25 to find out how many plums he can buy: $.75 / $.25 = 3

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
The price increase is 5% of $120. 
5% of $120 is 0.05 * $120 = $6.
So, the price after 1 year is $120 + $6 = $126.

Year 2: 
The price increase is 5% of $126. 
5% of $126 is 0.05 * $126 = $6.30.
So, the price after 2 years is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Year 3: 
The price increase is 5% of $132.30. 
5% of $132.30 is 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615.
So, the price after 3 years is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price after 3 years is $139.

Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, so 2 x 15 = 30 people checked in.
Now we subtract the 15 late checkout guests: 76 - 15 = 61

"Let's break this down step by step.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. We also know that the large stuffed animals cost three times the price of the small ones. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 x $4 = $12.

Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold x large stuffed animals. Then, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

The total amount she earned is $120. This is the sum of the money she earned from selling large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals.

The money she earned from selling large stuffed animals is $12x (since each large stuffed animal costs $12 and she sold x of them).

The money she earned from selling small stuffed animals is $4(2x) = $8x (since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and she sold 2x of them).

We know that the total amount she earned is $120, so we can set up the equation:

$12x + $8x = $120

Combine like terms:

$20x = $120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. But we want to know how many small stuffed animals she sold. We know she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so she sold 2x = 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals.

There's a 50% chance that the substitute teacher will come in and not collect the homework. So, there's a 100% - 50% = 50% chance that the normal teacher will come in.

If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, there's a 100% - 40% = 60% chance that she won't give everyone an extension.

If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give everyone an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, there's a 100% - 20% = 80% chance that he won't get a personal extension.

Now, we multiply the chances that the normal teacher comes in, doesn't give everyone an extension, and Marcus doesn't get a personal extension: 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 = 24%

"Let's say the number of balls in the second set is x. 
Then the number of balls in the first set is x + 4. 
The number of balls in the third set is x / 2.

We know that the total number of balls is 19. 
So, x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve this, we can multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

This is the same as 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine the x's: 5x + 8 = 38.

Now subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Now divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now we know the second set had 6 balls. 
The first set had x + 4 balls, so it had 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

"Ellen started with 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself. So there were 12 - 1 = 11 sodas left. 

Out of the 11 sodas, 3 were shaken and 8 were unshaken. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So there were 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas and 8 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen's friend will get sprayed if she picks a shaken soda. There are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left, so the total number of sodas left is 2 + 6 = 8.

The likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, multiplied by 100. So the likelihood is (2 / 8) * 100 = 25.

After 3 hours, the first train will have gone 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train will have gone 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are going in opposite directions, we need to add the distance they traveled. So, 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since these are the large jellyfish that change color, we can say that 1/3 of the large jellyfish is equal to 6.

Let's find out how many large jellyfish there are. If 1/3 of the large jellyfish is 6, then the total number of large jellyfish is 6 x 3 = 18.

Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary during retirement, which is $100,000 x 0.4 = $40,000 per year.

Since she wants to save for 20 years of retirement, she needs to save a total of $40,000 x 20 = $800,000.

Lauren is saving 20% of her current salary, which is $100,000 x 0.2 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount she needs to save ($800,000) by the amount she can save each year ($20,000).

$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years

Since Lauren has already been working (we don't know for how long), we can't give an exact answer. However, if we assume she hasn't started working yet, she would need to work for 40 years to save enough for retirement.

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles by the number of days in June. There are 30 days in June.

Total miles = 9,300 miles
Number of days = 30

Miles per day = Total miles / Number of days
Miles per day = 9,300 / 30
Miles per day = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she will cover 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract the miles she is planning to hike from the total miles per day.

Additional miles per day = Miles per day - Planned miles per day
Additional miles per day = 310 - 250
Additional miles per day = 60 miles per day

Since she hikes twice a day, we need to divide the additional miles by 2.

Additional miles per hike = Additional miles per day / 2
Additional miles per hike = 60 / 2
Additional miles per hike = 30 miles per hike

So, Soledad needs to hike 30 more miles per hike.

Let's say her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that time = distance / speed. So, the time she spends on the beach is 2 miles / x miles per minute = 2/x minutes. We are given that this time is 40 minutes. So, 2/x = 40.

To find x, we can multiply both sides by x to get 2 = 40x. Then, we can divide both sides by 40 to get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time she spends on the sidewalk. The time is 1 mile / (2x) miles per minute = 1 / (2 * 1/20) = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of the unknown water into his bottle, the temperature becomes at least 40 degrees. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. 

The total amount of water in the bottle is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces. 

The total heat in the bottle is the sum of the heat from the 4 ounces of 33-degree water and the 1 ounce of x-degree water. 

The heat from the 4 ounces of 33-degree water is 4 * 33 = 132. 

The heat from the 1 ounce of x-degree water is 1 * x = x. 

The total heat in the bottle is 132 + x. 

Since the total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces, the average temperature is (132 + x) / 5. 

We know that the average temperature is at least 40 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

(132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the temperature of the second mug is at least 68 degrees.

"The ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. To find the total number of parts in the ratio, we add 5 + 9 = 14.

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84. We can divide 84 by 14 to find the multiplier for the ratio. 84 / 14 = 6.

Now, we multiply the number of women in the ratio (9) by the multiplier (6) to find the total number of women on the bus. 9 * 6 = 54.

20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we subtract 20 from 54. 54 - 20 = 34.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to find out how many sunflowers he sold per day and then multiply that by 3.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day. He earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8, he sold $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, he sold 7 x 12 = 84 sunflowers from the bouquets per day.

He also earned $26 from the sunflower per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, he sold $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

So, he sold 84 + 13 = 97 sunflowers per day.

Now, let's multiply that by 3 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in 3 days. 97 x 3 = 291.

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to find out how much he spent and how much he made.

Adam has $100 and buys rocks for $5 each. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide $100 by $5.

Adam sells 12 rocks for $7 each. To find out how much he made, we multiply 12 by $7.
12 x $7 = $84

Adam spent $100 and made $84. To find out how much he lost, we subtract $84 from $100.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of the first ticket winning by the probability of the second ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so it has a 3 x 20% = 60% chance of winning.

To multiply these probabilities, we need to convert them to decimals: 20% = 0.2 and 60% = 0.6.

Now, we multiply: 0.2 x 0.6 = 0.12.

To convert this back to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 x 100 = 12%.

"To find out how much John spent on everything, we need to find out how much he spent on scotch and how much he spent on cognac.

He bought 10 bottles of scotch for $600. So, the cost of one bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

He bought twice as many bottles of cognac, so he bought 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of one bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of one bottle of scotch. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of one bottle of cognac is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of 20 bottles of cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of scotch plus the cost of cognac, which is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Archie buys a bag of beef jerky for $18.00, but it's $3.00 off. So the price Archie pays is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

There are 30 sticks in a bag. To find the cost of each stick, we need to divide the price Archie paid ($15.00) by the number of sticks (30).

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100. 
$0.50 x 100 = 50 cents.

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

There are 70 questions in the first test and 40 questions in the second test. So, the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110.

Audrey needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct. 70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77.

Audrey got 60% of 70 questions correct in the first test. 60% of 70 is 0.6 * 70 = 42.

So, Audrey needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct in total on both tests. Since she already got 42 correct on the first test, she needs to get 35 more questions correct on the second test.

"Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. 
The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so it's 5x - 4. 
The total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write an equation: x + (5x - 4) = 116. 
Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116. 
Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120. 
Divide both sides by 6: x = 20. 
Now we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20. 
The number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4, so it's 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

For the 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 5 medium candles in each room. 4 x 5 = 20 medium candles.

There are 4 people in the house and each person has a flashlight. 4 people x 1 flashlight/person = 4 flashlights.

There are 2 flashlights for each room. 8 rooms x 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.

Now, let's add up all the candles and flashlights.

Now we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. Crista has 20 plants. 4 + 8 = 12 plants need half a cup and 1 cup of water. So 20 - 12 = 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water.

8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water. A quarter of a cup is 0.25 cups. So 8 plants need 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups of water.

Ellen spent $105 and Lani spent $230. So they spent $105 + $230 = $335.

"To make 1 jar, it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit, which costs 2 x $6 = $12. 
It also takes 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, which costs 1.5 x $8 = $12. 
And it takes 2 pounds of honey, which costs 2 x $10 = $20. 
So the total cost to make 1 jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44. 
He sells each jar for $50. 
So the profit for 1 jar is $50 - $44 = $6. 
To make 10 jars, the profit is 10 x $6 = $60.

"To find the total dollar amount, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

1 quarter = 25 cents
32 quarters = 32 x 25 cents = 800 cents
800 cents = 8 dollars

1 dime = 10 cents
95 dimes = 95 x 10 cents = 950 cents
950 cents = 9.50 dollars

1 nickel = 5 cents
120 nickels = 120 x 5 cents = 600 cents
600 cents = 6 dollars

1 penny = 1 cent
750 pennies = 750 cents
750 cents = 7.50 dollars

Now, let's add the values together:
8 dollars + 9.50 dollars = 17.50 dollars
17.50 dollars + 6 dollars = 23.50 dollars
23.50 dollars + 7.50 dollars = 31 dollars

"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to add up how much she spent and subtract that from the money her parents gave her.

She spent $3.50 on ice cream.
She spent $7.50 for two movie tickets, so that's $7.50 x 2 = $15.
She spent $8.50 on a bracelet.

Now, let's add up how much she spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27.

Her parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the money she spent from the money her parents gave her: $40 - $27 = $13.

"Randy started with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So he has 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies, 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies.

Then he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So he has 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies.

Then he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So he has 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies.

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So he has 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies, 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies.

So Randy has 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies now.

"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He will sell half of them for $5 each and the other half for $7 each. 

Half of 12 is 6. So he will sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.

6 toy soldiers for $5 each will be 6 x $5 = $30.
6 toy soldiers for $7 each will be 6 x $7 = $42.

Now, we add $30 and $42 to find the total amount of money Matthew will earn. 
$30 + $42 = $72.

"Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days. 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So Nate fills 9 - 6 = 3 holes a day.

To fill 84 holes, Nate needs 84 / 3 = 28 days.

There are 7 days in a week. 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. 
To find 3/4 of 4000, we multiply 4000 by 3 and then divide by 4. 
4000 * 3 = 12000 
12000 / 4 = 3000 

So Butler High School enrolls 3000 students. 
To find the difference, we subtract 3000 from 4000.

"Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. 
He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. 
He gathered the correct number of beakers, but lost some, so let's call the number of beakers he lost x. 
Then the number of beakers he placed on the lab bench is 7 - x. 
The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench is 8 + 16 + (7 - x) = 29.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws. 

James is putting together 4 tables, so he needs 4 x 8 = 32 screws in total.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we need to subtract the number of screws he needs from the number of screws he has.

The total amount of money raised is $2180."
"If Vanessa ran 4 miles and she can run twice as far as Aaron, then Aaron ran 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find out how long it takes him to run 1 mile by dividing 16 minutes by 2 miles. 
16 / 2 = 8 minutes per mile.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it takes Vanessa twice as long to run 1 mile. 
8 * 2 = 16 minutes per mile for Vanessa.

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so we multiply 16 minutes per mile by 4 miles to find out how long it took her to run 4 miles. 
16 * 4 = 64 minutes.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the cost price of each watermelon. 

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. 
So, the cost price of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

He sold all of them at a profit of 25%. 
To find the selling price, we need to add 25% of the cost price to the cost price. 
25% of $1.60 is 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40.
So, the selling price of each watermelon is $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.

"To find the answer, we need to find out how old James' and Dora's brother is now. 

Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is 12 - 3 = 9 years old now.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old now.

John was 19 when James was born, so John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic.

The radiator costs $400, but Mark got it for 80% off. To find 80% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.8.
$400 * 0.8 = $320
So the discount is $320. To find the price Mark paid for the radiator, we subtract the discount from the original price.
$400 - $320 = $80

The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it took 3 hours to install the radiator. To find the total cost of the mechanic, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours.
$50 * 3 = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid.
$80 + $150 = $230

"Let's think about this. 

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. We know there are 20 animals and 70 legs. 

If all the animals were chickens, they would have 20 x 2 = 40 legs. But they have 70 legs, so some of them must be cows.

Let's say the number of cows is x. Then the number of chickens is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. The chickens have 2 legs each, so the chickens have (20 - x) x 2 legs. The cows have 4 legs each, so the cows have x x 4 legs.

We can write this as an equation: (20 - x) x 2 + x x 4 = 70.

Let's simplify the equation: 40 - 2x + 4x = 70.

Combine like terms: 40 + 2x = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2x = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 15.

So there are 15 cows. The number of chickens is 20 - x = 20 - 15 = 5.
