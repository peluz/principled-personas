"Let's see... Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so that's 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. Then she uses 4 eggs to bake muffins, so that's 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left. She sells those 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each.

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

"So, a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. And it takes half that much white fiber, so that's 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. 

So, 2 bolts of blue and 1 bolt of white, that's 2 + 1 = 3 bolts in total.

"Josh buys a house for 80,000 and puts in 50,000 in repairs. So he spent 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. That means the new value is 150% of the original value plus the original value. The original value is 80,000. 150% of 80,000 is 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000. So the new value is 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000.

Josh sold the house for 200,000 and spent 130,000. So he made 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000.

"So James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. That's 3 x 60, which is 180 meters. He does that 3 times a week, so that's 180 x 3.

"To figure this out, we need to know how much feed Wendi gives her chickens in total each day. Since she has 20 chickens and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, we multiply 20 chickens by 3 cups of feed per chicken. 

20 x 3 = 60 cups of feed per day.

Now we know how much feed Wendi gives her chickens in total each day. We also know how much feed she gives them in the morning and the afternoon. 

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed. 
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. 

So, we add 15 cups and 25 cups to get the total amount of feed given in the morning and the afternoon. 

15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.

Now we subtract 40 cups of feed from the total amount of feed given each day to find out how much feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.

60 - 40 = 20

"Let's break this down. Kylar's gonna buy 16 glasses. The first one costs 5 bucks. The second one costs 60% of 5 bucks. 60% of 5 is 3 bucks. So the second one costs 3 bucks. 

Now, every other glass after that is gonna be 3 bucks for every other one, and 5 bucks for the ones in between. So, we got 8 glasses that cost 5 bucks, and 8 glasses that cost 3 bucks.

8 glasses at 5 bucks each is 8 x 5 = 40 bucks. 8 glasses at 3 bucks each is 8 x 3 = 24 bucks. 

Now, we add 40 and 24, and we get 64 bucks.

"So Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so that's 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

"Let's break this down. Carla can download 2 GB per minute. 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB. So Carla downloads 80 GB in 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 

Then Windows restarts and Carla has to start over. So Carla downloads the whole 200 GB file in 200 / 2 = 100 minutes. 

But Carla already downloaded 40 minutes, and then the computer restarted for 20 minutes. So Carla's total time is 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"Let's break this down step by step.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 60 * 3 
Distance = 180 miles

Now, John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. 

Then, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph. 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 30 * 0.5 
Distance = 15 miles

Now, he drives the remaining time at 80 mph. He has 4 hours - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours left. 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 80 * 1.5 
Distance = 120 miles

So, in the 4 hours, John covers a total distance of 15 + 120 = 135 miles. 

Since he was 180 miles away from home initially, we subtract the distance he covered in the 4 hours from the initial distance: 
Distance from home = 180 - 135 
Distance from home = 45 miles

"Eliza gets 10 bucks an hour for the first 40 hours. So for 40 hours, she gets 40 * 10 = 400 bucks. 

For the 5 hours extra, she gets 1.2 times her regular rate, so that's 1.2 * 10 = 12 bucks an hour. For 5 hours, that's 5 * 12 = 60 bucks.

So, she gets 400 + 60 = 460 bucks.

"Let's break this down. 

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. 

In the second month, it had three times as many downloads as the first month. So that's 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.

Then in the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%. So we gotta find 30% of 180. That's 0.3 x 180 = 54. Then we subtract that from 180. So 180 - 54 = 126 downloads in the third month.

Now we add up all the downloads: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

6 dozen mini cheesecakes cost 55 dollars per dozen. So 6 x 55 is... um... 330 dollars.

Now, let's add them all up. 204 + 160 is 364, and then add 330... that's 694 dollars.

"Let's break this down. 

Carlos spends $90 to plant the tree. Then each year, he gets 7 lemons and sells them for $1.5 each. So he gets 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 each year. But he also spends $3 each year to water and feed the tree. So he's really only getting $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 each year.

Now we gotta figure out how many years it'll take for him to make back the $90 he spent. We can do that by dividing $90 by $7.5. That's like, um, 12. So it'll take him 12 years to make back the money he spent, but that's not really earning money, that's just breaking even. So it'll take him 13 years to actually start earning money.

"Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of them at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She had x - x/3 vacuum cleaners left.

Then she sold 2 more at the red house, so she had x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

She had (x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left.

We know she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To solve this equation, we can start by multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2(x - x/3 - 2) - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10

This simplifies to:

x - x/3 - 2 = 10

We can add 2 to both sides to get:

x - x/3 = 12

We can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3x - x = 36

This simplifies to:

2x = 36

We can divide both sides by 2 to get:

x = 18

Next, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% is the same as 0.25. So, 0.25 x 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

Now, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students left.

These 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage, we need to divide 12 by the total number of students (20) and multiply by 100.

Now, them chips got 250 calories per serving. I gotta see how many servings I can have with 200 calories. 

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings. I can have 0.8 servings of chips.

Now, I gotta see how many grams that is. The whole bag is 300g and it got 5 servings. 

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving. 

Now, I multiply 60g per serving by 0.8 servings. 

60g * 0.8 = 48g.

"To figure this out, we gotta break it down. 

First, we know it takes 1 pound of beeswax to make 10 candles. So if Charlie makes 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. 

The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 x $10.00, which is $20.00.

Now, if Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, he makes 20 x $2.00, which is $40.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the cost from the amount he made: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"Let's break this down step by step.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. Each article takes 4 hours, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours on Monday.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. 7 articles x 4 hours each is 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Twice 7 is 14, so she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday. 14 articles x 4 hours each is 56 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104.

"Let's think this through. Candice started with 80 post-it notes. Then she bought some more. We don't know how many she bought, but we'll call that number x. So now she has 80 + x post-it notes. 

She used 220 post-it notes at work. So after that, she had 80 + x - 220 post-it notes left. We know that she had 23 post-it notes left. 

So we can set up an equation: 80 + x - 220 = 23. 

Now we need to solve for x. First, let's add 220 to both sides: 80 + x = 23 + 220. 

Now we have 80 + x = 243. 

Now let's subtract 80 from both sides: x = 243 - 80. 

x = 163.

So the package she bought had 163 post-it notes.

John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we need to divide $200 by $40. 

$200 / $40 = 5

So John bought 5 blue ties. 

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. 50% of $40 is $20, so the red ties cost $40 + $20 = $60 each.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on red ties. 10 red ties * $60 = $600.

He spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties. So, he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.

On Friday, the mechanic fixed 12 car tires and no truck tires. 12 car tires at $40 each is 12 x $40 = $480.

Now we need to see which day the mechanic made more money. Thursday was $520 and Friday was $480. Thursday was more.

So, 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds left for the boxes.

Since Shiela bought 5 units, the total interest is 5 x $3 = $15.

Now, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is $750 (cost) + $15 (interest) = $765.

"Let's see... John drinks water 3 times a day, plus one more before bed, that's 4 times a day. He does this 5 days a week, that's Monday to Friday. So that's 4 times a day, 5 days a week, that's 4 x 5 = 20. 

On the weekends, he drinks water 3 times a day, plus one more before bed, that's 4 times a day, but he has soda with dinner on Saturday and Sunday, so that's 3 times a day, 2 days a week, that's 3 x 2 = 6. 

So, John drinks 20 glasses of water on weekdays and 6 glasses of water on weekends, that's 20 + 6 = 26.

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. A third is like 1/3. So she places 1/3 of 750 pieces. That's 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

"To find the inner volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box. 

The outer dimensions are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from the length and width, and 2 inches from the height.

The inner dimensions are (5 - 2) inches by (6 - 2) inches by (4 - 2) inches. 
That's 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

Now, we multiply the inner dimensions to find the inner volume of one box: 
3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 
So, in total for those days, he watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

He watched 7 hours in all, so on Wednesday, he watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. 

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes, that's 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes.

"Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. He wants to bake twice as many this year, so he wants to bake 2x cookies. But he actually baked 15 more than that, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies. Then he dropped 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left. We know that's 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine the constants:
2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:
2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 50

So Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Marcell's roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long, so he ate 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Now, let's add the number of roll-ups they ate: 48 + 42 = 90.

To find the average, we need to divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are 2 people): 90 / 2 = 45.

"Let's break this down. 

First, we need to figure out how far Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, to find out how far she rows in 64 seconds, we need to multiply 20 feet by 4 (since 64 divided by 16 is 4). 

20 feet * 4 = 80 feet

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. To find out how many 10-foot sections are in 80 feet, we need to divide 80 by 10.

80 / 10 = 8

Now, we know there are 8 sections of 10 feet. Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we multiply 8 by 2.

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. 
1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 
So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

She bought 10 of them 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each, so that's 10 x $10 = $100. And she bought 5 of them 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each, so that's 5 x $16 = $80. So she spent $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, prices went up 50%, so that means the new price is 1.5 times the old price. For them 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the new price is $10 x 1.5 = $15 each. And for them 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the new price is $16 x 1.5 = $24 each.

If she sells all the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, she'll get 10 x $15 = $150. And if she sells all the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, she'll get 5 x $24 = $120. So she'll get $150 + $120 = $270.

Now, to find the profit, I gotta subtract what she spent from what she got. So, $270 - $180 = $90.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. So, the number of vehicles that came in on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary four years later was 40% higher than what he was making four years ago, we need to calculate 40% of $40000.

40% of $40000 is 0.4 * $40000 = $16000.

So, Adrien's salary four years later is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Now, we know that Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's four years ago. Let's call Lylah's salary four years ago 'x'. Then Adrien's salary four years ago is 1.3x (since it's 30% higher).

We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = $40000

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 1.3:

x = $40000 / 1.3
x = $30769 (approximately)

So Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrien's salary increased by 40%, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. 

40% of $30769 is 0.4 * $30769 = $12307.

So, Lylah's salary four years later is $30769 + $12307 = $43076.

Now, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later to get the total salary:

$56000 + $43076 = $99076.

Now for the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so that's 6 + 1 = 7 hours for each of the other days. There's 4 other days, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Since Steve gets home in 36 minutes and Tim gets home in 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long he will be waiting, we need to subtract the time it takes Steve to get home from the time it takes Tim to get home. So, 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes. That's 2 days. Each class is 2 hours. So that's 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 hours per week for those days.

So in total, Kimo has 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week.

There are 16 weeks in a semester. So Kimo has 17 x 16 = 272 hours in a semester.

"Let's break this down. 

First, we need to convert the length of the rolls and croissants to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot. 

The rolls are 4 inches long, so that's 4 / 12 = 1/3 feet per roll. 
The croissants are 6 inches long, so that's 6 / 12 = 1/2 feet per croissant. 

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good. 

The rolls are 1/3 feet per roll, and there are 300 rolls, so that's 300 * 1/3 = 100 feet. 
The croissants are 1/2 feet per croissant, and there are 120 croissants, so that's 120 * 1/2 = 60 feet. 
The baguettes are 2 feet per baguette, and there are 60 baguettes, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 feet. 

Now, let's add up the lengths of all the baked goods. 
100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet.

The baboons need 100 bananas a month, so for 2 months, they need 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add all the bananas together: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400.

"Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, each back-and-forth run is 200 yards. So Blake runs 15 x 200 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each of these runs is 80 yards (40 yards each way). So Kelly runs 200 + (34 x 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards. The difference is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"Let's break this down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every 2 months, we divide 36 by 2, which is 18. But that's not right, we need to divide 36 by 2 and that is 18, so the price will increase 18 times.

Now, let's calculate the price increase. The price increases by 20% of the original price, which is $20. 20% of $20 is 0.20 x $20 = $4.

So, the price will increase by $4 every 2 months. But we need to add this to the original price, so the new price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

Now, we need to do this 18 times, but that's too much work. Let's think of a better way. We can multiply the original price by 1.20 (1 + 0.20) to get the new price after 2 months, which is $20 x 1.20 = $24.

Now, we need to do this 18 times, so we multiply $24 by 1.20, and then multiply that by 1.20, and so on. But that's still too much work. Let's use a shortcut. We can raise 1.20 to the power of 18, and then multiply the original price by that.

1.20^18 is 55.9017, so we multiply $20 by 55.9017, and we get...

Combine like terms: 3x + 4 = 28. 

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes, we multiply the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by 60.

Now we add those two together: 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"Let's break this down. 

We know each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs half of 40g, which is 20g.

Now, we have 25 chocolate bars, so 25 * 40g is 1000g. We have 80 candied apples, so 80 * 20g is 1600g.

Now we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples together: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

Now, let's add 'em all up... 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"Let's break this down. 

First, we need to find out how much 20 dozen cups cost. But we don't know that yet. We do know that half a dozen plates cost $6000 each. Half a dozen is 6. So, 6 plates cost $6000. 

Now, we need to find the cost of 20 dozen cups. We know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. But we need to know the cost of half a dozen plates first. We already know that, it's $6000. 

Now, we subtract $1200 from $6000. $6000 - $1200 = $4800. So, 20 dozen cups cost $4800.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 cup. There are 12 cups in a dozen. So, there are 20 * 12 = 240 cups in 20 dozen cups. 

Now, we divide $4800 by 240. $4800 / 240 = $20.

"To figure this out, we need to know how much money Sara needs. The jacket costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes cost 2 x $20 = $40. So she needs $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved. She also earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times. So she earns 4 x $5 = $20 from babysitting. Now she has $10 + $20 = $30.

She still needs $70 - $30 = $40. She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide $40 by $4. $40 / $4 = 10.

"Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Then the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x, and the number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(x + 2).

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs a day, we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 4

So Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to find the distance around the park first. The park is a rectangle, so we need to find the distance around it. 

The distance around a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. The park is 1.5 miles by 6 miles. So, we have two sides that are 1.5 miles and two sides that are 6 miles. 

So, the distance around the park is 1.5 + 1.5 + 6 + 6. That's 3 + 12, which is 15 miles.

Now, we know Gary walks at 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we need to divide the distance by his speed. 

So, we divide 15 miles by 3 miles per hour. That's 15 / 3, which is 5.

"Let's think this through. 

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers. 

Now, let's add the customers from the first two days: 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to subtract the customers from the first two days from the total: 500 - 250 = 250.

"Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water. So now the small pool has x - 16 gallons of water.

The big pool lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water too. So now the big pool has 2x - 16 gallons of water.

We know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 16 to both sides, we get:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

-2x = -48

Dividing both sides by -2, we get:

x = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now the small pool has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons of water.

She's going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. So she's going to pay a total of $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's subtract the amount she's going to pay from the amount she needs to pay back. $2200 - $1980 = $220.

Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now we know Naomi scored 68, Yuri scored 44, and Brianna scored 85. The total points scored by these three is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197. 

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees = $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

"Let's break this down step by step.

First, it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees. 40% of 20 minutes is 8 minutes (40% = 0.4, 0.4 x 20 = 8). So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

The total time to warm the oil is 20 + 28 = 48 minutes. 

It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, it takes 48 - 5 = 43 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 + 43 = 91 minutes.

The collar takes a tenth of that, so it's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. 
The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so it's 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches we know: 
900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches. 
Since there are two sleeves, we divide 630 by 2 to get the number of stitches per sleeve: 630 / 2 = 315.

He also digs 15 large holes, and it takes him 10 minutes per hole. So that's 15 x 10 = 150 minutes for the large holes.

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes: 90 + 150 = 240 minutes.

Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"Let's say the number of players on the defense is x. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

The total number of players is 105, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105.

Combine like terms: 3x + x/2 = 105.

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 6x + x = 210.

Combine like terms: 7x = 210.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 30.

First, we gotta figure out how many people Martha invited. She invited 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people. Then she invited 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. So in total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. That leaves 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So 2 more people can't come.

That leaves 16 - 2 = 14 people.

100 * 2 = 200
200 / 5 = 40

So there are 40 junior programmers. Now, we need to find out how many senior programmers there are. Since there are 100 employees in total and 40 are junior programmers, we subtract 40 from 100 to get the number of senior programmers.

100 - 40 = 60

Now we know there are 60 senior programmers. Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so we add $400 to $2000.

$2000 + $400 = $2400

Now we know senior programmers are paid $2400 per month. To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we multiply the number of junior programmers by their salary, multiply the number of senior programmers by their salary, and add the two amounts together.

40 * $2000 = $80,000

"Let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how much the picture frames cost with the logo etched. 20% of 20 is 4, so the picture frames with the logo will be 20 + 4 = 24 dollars each. 

Now, we need to multiply that by the number of seniors. 44 x 24 is 1056.

Now, we need to add the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will get pins, and they cost 5 dollars each. 2 x 5 is 10.

Now, we need to add the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so that's 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. They get cords that cost 12 dollars each. 11 x 12 is 132.

Now, we need to add all the costs together. 1056 + 10 + 132 is 1198.

"If Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, he saved 20% of the cost. To find the amount he saved, we need to calculate 20% of $400. 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80.

So, Ethan saved $80. To find the total cost, we subtract the amount he saved from the original cost.

$400 - $80 = $320.

On Saturday, they sold double that, so that's 2 x 14 = 28 pairs of shoes.

On Sunday, they sold half of what they did on Saturday, so that's 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of shoes. But 6 people returned their pairs, so that's 14 - 6 = 8 pairs of shoes.

Now, let's add up all the pairs of shoes they sold: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs of shoes.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply 50 by 2 to get the total number of shoes: 50 x 2 = 100.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. 

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, so she picked 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

The interest rate is 10% per year, but she borrowed the money for 5 months, which is 5/12 of a year. So the interest rate for 5 months is 10% * 5/12 = 4.17% (approximately).

Now, let's calculate the interest: 
Interest = 10% of $3,650 = 0.0417 * $3,650 ≈ $152.55

Now, let's add the interest to the amount she borrowed: 
Total amount to be paid = $3,650 + $152.55 ≈ $3,802.55

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5: 
$3,802.55 ÷ 5 ≈ $760.51

She sells each cup for $1, so she makes 36 x $1 = $36 from selling lemonade.

She spent $18 on supplies. So, her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Since she has 36 cups, she will be open for 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the AC by 5 hours a day, he's using it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. So the AC uses 900 * 3 = 2700 watts per day. That's 2700 / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts per day.

We know that camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each. So, the total number of humps (or bumps) is 2C + D.

2C + D = 304

We are also given that the total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is C + D. So, we can write another equation:

C + D = 180

Now, we can solve these two equations. We can multiply the second equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2D = 360

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this equation to get:

D = 56

"Let's break this down. 

There were 50 cats. 4 boats came and took 5 cats each. That's 4 x 5 = 20 cats taken away. So, 50 - 20 = 30 cats left.

Then, the price goes up to $12 a month. He pays this rate for 8 months. So that's 8 x 12 = 96 dollars.

Now, he's been paying for 6 + 8 = 14 months. He's gotta pay for 24 months total (2 years). So he's gotta pay the new rate of $14 a month for 24 - 14 = 10 months. That's 10 x 14 = 140 dollars.

Now, we add up all the money he paid: 48 + 96 + 140 = 284 dollars.

"Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and $50 for spending cash, so he needs $150 total. He sells his cards for $1.5 each. To find out how many cards he sold, we need to divide $150 by $1.5. 

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards. 

But he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the cards he sold is 2/3 of his total cards. Let's call the total number of cards x. Then 2/3 * x = 100. 

To find x, we need to divide 100 by 2/3. To do that, we multiply 100 by 3/2. 

100 * 3/2 = 150

So he started with 150 cards.

For the 18 people who could have 2 hotdogs, that's 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs. For the 18 people who could have 1 hotdog, that's 18 x 1 = 18 hotdogs. So in total, he prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

Now, 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog. That means everyone had at least 1 hotdog, so that's 40 hotdogs. But since everyone wanted a second hotdog, that's another 40 hotdogs. In total, that's 40 + 40 = 80 hotdogs.

The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, but 80 hotdogs were needed. So, 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs were not prepared. Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, that means 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James' swim time is 10% faster than Jon's. 
10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. 
So James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James' bike ride is 5 minutes longer than Jon's. 
So James' bike ride time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find James' run time.

30 minutes is half of 60 minutes, so it ran half of 32 miles. Half of 32 is 16 miles.

Now we know the horse ran 16 miles. For every mile, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, it eats 16 x 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails of hay cost 8 x $3 = $24.

Now, let's set up an equation: $12 + $3 + x = $19.

"So Jason wants to break in his shoes in 3 weeks. Thats 3 weeks times 7 days in a week, thats 21 days. But he can only walk 4 days a week, so thats 3 weeks times 4 days, thats 12 days. He needs to walk 240 minutes to break in the shoes, and he has 12 days to do it. So thats 240 minutes divided by 12 days, thats 20 minutes a day.

"Sarah spent 300 dollars on books. Each book was 15 dollars. To find out how many books she bought, we need to divide 300 by 15. 

300 divided by 15 is 20. So she bought 20 books. 

She gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each kid got, we need to divide 20 by 4. 

20 divided by 4 is 5.

"Let's break this down. There's 9 kids allergic to dairy and 6 to peanuts, that's 15. But we counted the 3 kids allergic to both twice, so we gotta subtract 3. That's 15 - 3 = 12. Now, we gotta subtract 12 from the total number of kids, which is 32. So, 32 - 12 = 20.

"Let's break it down. There are 3 groups of 200 employees. So, the total number of employees is 3 x 200 = 600. 

Each group has 7 tour guides, so there are 3 x 7 = 21 tour guides.

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides: 600 + 21 = 621.

"Let's break it down. 

Plane tickets for 2 people cost 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal. 20% of $1500 is 0.20 x $1500 = $300. So the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

They stayed for 3 days, so the hotel cost is $1800 x 3 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is $10,000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15,400.

"Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Half of 4 is 2. So Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Three times 3 is 9. So Jasper has 9 tubes of yellow paint.

Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint and 9 tubes of yellow paint. 2 + 9 is 11.

"Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. They picked 60 oranges. To find out how many oranges Stetson ate, we need to multiply 60 by 2/5. 

60 * 2/5 is the same as 60 * 2, then divide by 5. 
60 * 2 is 120. 
120 / 5 is 24. 

So Stetson ate 24 oranges. He gave up $10 for each orange. 
24 * 10 is 240.

"Let's break this down. 

Uncle Ben has 4 horses. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal. He feeds them twice a day, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per horse per day. 

Since he has 4 horses, that's 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day. 

He wants to feed them for 5 days, so that's 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats. 

One bag has 50 pounds of oats. So, to find out how many bags he needs, we divide 200 by 50. That's 200 / 50 = 4.

If he saves 2 dollars a day, in 1 day he'll have 2 dollars, in 2 days he'll have 4 dollars, in 3 days he'll have 6 dollars, in 4 days he'll have 8 dollars.

"So, Heather buys 2 packs of razors, but she gets one free, so she only pays for one. That one pack costs $4.00. But she has a $2.00 coupon, so she pays $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00. 

She gets 2 packs of razors, and each pack has 4 razors, so she gets 2 * 4 = 8 razors. 

Now, she pays $2.00 for 8 razors. To find the cost of each razor, we divide $2.00 by 8. $2.00 is 200 cents, so 200 / 8 = 25.

"So we got 9 cheerleaders that are 64 inches tall and 1 that's 60 inches tall. 

The bottom row has 4 girls, so that's 4 x 64 = 256 inches. 
The next row has 3 girls, so that's 3 x 64 = 192 inches. 
The next row has 2 girls, so that's 2 x 64 = 128 inches. 
The top row has 1 girl, and she's 60 inches tall.

Now we add all those inches together: 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.

Now we gotta convert that to feet. There's 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 636 by 12. That's 636 / 12 = 53.

"Let's think about this. The first venue costs $200 plus $5 per person for food. The second venue costs $25 per person. 

If we say the number of guests is 'x', then the cost of the first venue is $200 + $5x. The cost of the second venue is $25x.

We want to find out when these two costs are equal. So we set them equal to each other: $200 + $5x = $25x.

Now, let's try to solve for 'x'. Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x.

Now, divide both sides by $20: $200 / $20 = x.

"Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. 
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that together they found 43 insects, so we can write an equation:
x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
x + x + 7 = 43

Combine like terms again:
2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 18

Now we know Bodhi found 18 insects. 
David found half of that, so David found 18/2 = 9 insects.
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

First, let's calculate the total hours if he worked 4 hours a week for 8 weeks. That's 4 hours * 8 weeks = 32 hours.

Now, let's look at the exceptions. He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. That's 5 hours * 2 weeks = 10 hours. He also spent 6 hours in one week.

So, the total hours for the exceptions is 10 hours + 6 hours = 16 hours.

Now, we need to subtract the hours he didn't work 4 hours from the total hours. He didn't work 4 hours for 3 weeks (2 weeks of 5 hours and 1 week of 6 hours). So, we subtract 4 hours * 3 weeks = 12 hours from the total hours.

Now, we add the hours he actually worked during those 3 weeks. So, we add 16 hours to the total hours.

The total hours is 32 hours - 12 hours + 16 hours = 36 hours.

On the second stop, 21 people get off, so we subtract 21 from 80. That's 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. 3 times fewer than 21 is 21 / 3 = 7. So 7 people get on the bus. Now we add 7 to 59, that's 59 + 7 = 66.

"Let's break it down. 

The first book is 31 mm thick. 
The second book is 50 mm thick. 
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. 
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 31 * 2 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add them all up: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.

"Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 in the second week, and 15 in the third week. To find out how many vlogs she made in total, we need to add those numbers together. 

18 + 21 = 39
39 + 15 = 54

So Emma made 54 vlogs in the first three weeks. Now, we need to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach 72. To do that, we subtract 54 from 72.

The $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He spent $8, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.

He tripled the amount he had left, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

"Let's break this down. 

There are 30 days in April. The first half is 15 days and the second half is also 15 days. 

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half. Let's say he saves x dollars per day in the first half. Then he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

In the first half, he will save 15x dollars. In the second half, he will save 15 * 2x = 30x dollars.

The total amount he wants to save is $1125. So we can set up the equation: 15x + 30x = 1125.

Combine like terms: 45x = 1125.

Divide both sides by 45: x = 25.

So Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half. In the second half, he saves twice that, which is 2 * 25 = 50 dollars per day.

Now, let's add all that up... $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13. 

Verna gave $20, so to find the change, we subtract $13 from $20... $20 - $13 = $7.

"Jairus gets 0.8 dollars for each task. He did 20 tasks, so he gets 0.8 * 20 = 16 dollars. 

Jenny gets 0.5 dollars for each task. She did 20 tasks, so she gets 0.5 * 20 = 10 dollars.

Now, let's see how much more Jairus gets than Jenny. Jairus gets 16 dollars and Jenny gets 10 dollars. So, Jairus gets 16 - 10 = 6 dollars more.

One calculator costs $12. 
One geometry set costs $10. 

Now, let's add all these costs together: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30. 

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount, we need to find 10% of $30.

He wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests. So he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles of water.

He already has 48 bottles, but he needs 140. So he needs 140 - 48 = 92 more bottles of water.

Now, if Ray swims 3 miles on a cold day, it will take him 3 x 16 = 48 minutes. If he swims 3 miles on a warm day, it will take him 3 x 34 = 102 minutes.

"Let's see... On Amazon, the boots cost 16 dollars and shipping is 4 dollars. So that's 16 + 4 = 20 dollars. 

On eBay, the boots cost 13 dollars, but shipping is twice as much as Amazon, so that's 4 x 2 = 8 dollars. So on eBay, it's 13 + 8 = 21 dollars.

Now, let's see how much more expensive eBay is... 21 - 20 = 1 dollar.

"If a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, then for every 100 grams of mushrooms, John gets 3 grams of protein. 

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how much protein he gets per day, we need to figure out how many 100 grams are in 200 grams. That's 2. 

So, if 100 grams has 3 grams of protein, then 200 grams has 2 x 3 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Now, we need to find out how much protein he gets per week. There are 7 days in a week. So, we multiply 6 grams of protein per day by 7 days. That's 6 x 7 = 42 grams of protein per week.

"Let's say Jerry's age 5 years ago was x. Then his current age is 2x. 

Since 5 years have passed, we can say x + 5 = 2x.

So Jerry's age 5 years ago was 5. Now he is 2x, which is 2 * 5 = 10. 

In 3 years, Jerry will be 10 + 3 = 13.

"George needs 2 implants. Each implant costs $2000. So 2 implants cost 2 x $2000 = $4000. He also wants a crown made of porcelain for one of the implants, which costs $500. So the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500. He already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900. 

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we need to divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15). $3900 / $15 = 260.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"Let's break this down. 

Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400. It says that's half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. So if we call the total amount she earned from selling green hats 'x', then we know that 400 is half of 'x'. 

So 400 = x / 2. To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 2. That gives us x = 800. 

So she made 800 from green hats and 400 from red hats. That's a total of 800 + 400 = 1200 in the first month.

Now, in the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So we multiply 1200 by 3/4. That's 1200 * 3 / 4 = 900.

So in the second month, she made 900. To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the two amounts together: 1200 + 900 = 2100.

Days to finish the book = 200 / 10

"Let's think about this. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We know that the total number of legs is 70. We also know that the total number of heads is 20, which means the total number of animals is 20.

Let's say the number of sheep is S and the number of geese is G. We know that S + G = 20 (total number of animals).

We also know that 4S + 2G = 70 (total number of legs).

Now, let's try to solve this. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get 2S + 2G = 40.

Now, let's subtract this equation from the second equation: (4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
This gives us 2S = 30.

Now, let's divide both sides by 2: S = 15.

Then she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car. 20% is like 1/5, so that's 2400 divided by 5, which is 480.

So she puts 1200 into retirement and 480 for her car. That's 1200 + 480 = 1680 total.

She started with 2400. Now she has 2400 - 1680 = 720 left.

Now, Hannah is also setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. That's 3 x 5 = 15 fireworks.

So, in total, Hannah will see 120 fireworks from the city and 15 fireworks from her backyard. That's 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks.

20 people * 2 drinks = 40 drinks. 20 people * 3 snacks = 60 snacks. 

40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 things. Each thing costs $2.

Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds. So together they can haul 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

The three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds. Gissela and Gordy's trucks can haul 8,800 pounds. So Gary's truck can haul 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Then he got 3 mini quiches for $4.00 each, so that's 3 x $4.00 = $12.00. 
And he got 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each, so that's 13 x $1.00 = $13.00. 

Now let's add all that up: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00. 

Marcus gets 10% off, so we gotta figure out what 10% of $50.00 is. 10% is like 10/100, so we can just move the decimal point one spot to the left and then multiply by 10. $50.00 becomes $5.00, then $5.00 x 10 = $50.00, but we need 10% of $50.00, so we need to divide $50.00 by 10, so $50.00 ÷ 10 = $5.00.

"So Jenna and her 4 roommates, that's 5 people. They gotta split the bill. The bill is $100 a month. There's 12 months in a year, so that's 100 * 12 = 1200 dollars a year. Now they gotta split that 5 ways. So that's 1200 / 5 = 240.

"Let's see... 8 dozen glasses is like 8 groups of 12, so that's 8 x 12 = 96 glasses. And 4 dozen plates is like 4 groups of 12, so that's 4 x 12 = 48 plates.

Now, 10 glasses were broken, so we gotta subtract that from 96. That's 96 - 10 = 86 glasses left. And 6 plates were broken, so we gotta subtract that from 48. That's 48 - 6 = 42 plates left.

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now. That's a total of... 86 + 42 = 128.

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So she trades 27 small stickers for 9 large buttons.

She has 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

She has 20 large stickers left. She trades them for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons. So she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

She already had 3 small stickers. She traded them for 3 small buttons.

So she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons and 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons.

Since a large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons. 29 large buttons is 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

So she has 87 + 63 = 150 small buttons.

Since a small button is the smallest unit, we can say she has 150 small buttons."
"Joey played 2 matches on Monday. He played 1 match on Friday. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 matches on Saturday. 

So, let's count them all: 2 on Monday, 1 on Friday, and 4 on Saturday. That's 2 + 1 + 4 = 7.

"Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Then the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, since it's twice as many.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, and that everyone voted. So the total number of votes is 33.

Since the number of votes in favor plus the number of votes against is equal to the total number of votes, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

So the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, and the number of votes in favor is 2x, which is 2 * 11 = 22.

"Let's break it down step by step.

11 students need size extra-small.

Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.

Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.

Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the students: 
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

Next, we need to find out how many people think horse #7 will win. 60% of 40 people is 0.60 x 40 = 24 people.

Now, we need to find out how many people think horse #12 will win. We already know that 10 people think horse #2 will win and 24 people think horse #7 will win. So, the rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 people.

The first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so it needs x/2 cases of shingles. 
The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles is 250. 
So, x/2 + x + x = 250. 
Combine like terms: 2.5x = 250. 
Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 100.

The third house needs x cases of shingles, which is 100. But we also know that the third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x = 100 cases of shingles.

"To figure this out, we gotta think about how long it takes Jack to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Jack to drive to the museum. We know it's 150 miles away, and he's driving 75 miles per hour. So, we divide the distance by the speed: 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.

Since he's driving back home too, we gotta double that time: 2 hours x 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum, which is 6 hours. So, the total time is 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours.

Mike has 600 movies. A third of the movies are in series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 movies in series.

The cost of the series movies is 1/6 of the normal movie cost, so that's $10 / 6 = $1.67 per movie. But since we're buying the series together, we'll just multiply the number of series movies by this cost: 200 * $1.67 = $334.

Now, let's subtract the series movies from the total: 600 - 200 = 400 movies left.

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so that's 400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies.

The cost of the older movies is $5 per movie, so that's 160 * $5 = $800.

Now, let's subtract the older movies from the remaining movies: 400 - 160 = 240 movies left.

Let's say the number of white fish he bought is x. Then the number of orange fish he bought is 2x (since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish).

We know he had 4 white fish and got x more, so the total number of white fish is 4 + x.

We know he had 3 orange fish and got 2x more, so the total number of orange fish is 3 + 2x.

"Let's break this down. 

First, we need to figure out how many miles Andy drives each day. Since he drives to work and back home, that's 2 trips. The distance for each trip is 5 miles, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 miles per day.

Now, since he only drives from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. So, the total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day x 5 days = 50 miles/week.

Now, we need to figure out how many gallons of gas he uses per week. His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so we divide the total miles driven per week by 10. That's 50 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, we need to figure out how much money he spends on gas per week. The price of gas is $3/gallon, so we multiply the gallons used per week by the price per gallon. That's 5 gallons/week x $3/gallon = $15/week.

She also got 140 quarters. Each quarter is 0.25 dollars, so that's 140 x 0.25 = 35 dollars from the quarters.

Now, let's add the money she spent: 120 dollars from the twenties and 35 dollars from the quarters. That's 120 + 35 = 155 dollars.

Now, each of these 6 groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. There's 9 people in each group, so we multiply 6 groups by 9 people, that's 54 people. And each of 'em brought back 2 seashells, so we multiply 54 by 2, that's 108 seashells.

Now we subtract the discount from the original price: $40 - $10 = $30. 

So the jeans cost $30 after the discount. 

Mike pays with a $50 bill, so we subtract the price of the jeans from $50: $50 - $30 = $20.

"Let's break this down step by step.

The company starts with 200 employees. They hire 20 new employees each month, so after 3 months, they will have:

200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees in month 1) = 220
220 + 20 (new employees in month 2) = 240
240 + 20 (new employees in month 3) = 260

So, after 3 months, the company has 260 employees.

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in one month, we multiply the number of employees by the salary:

260 employees * $4000 per month = $1,040,000 per month

Since we want to know the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after 3 months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:

To find the total, we need to divide 14 by 70% (or 0.7). 14 / 0.7 = 20.

Now we know the total number of stuffed animals will be 20. If the goats are 30% of 20, we multiply 20 by 30% (or 0.3). 20 * 0.3 = 6.

So Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats."

Now, we need to find out how many fifth graders passed. 80% of 400 is 0.8 * 400 = 320. 

Now we know how many students passed in each grade: 
- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it can be. We know that the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, and the height is 3 inches. To find the length, we divide the area by the height. 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards. 
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. 
So, x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341. 
Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341. 
Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329. 
Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Now we know PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs. 

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so that's 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add them all up: 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 27.

"To figure this out, we gotta do some math. 

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, 4 x $0.35 is $1.40. Then, we gotta add the cost per mile, which is $0.08 per mile, and the distance is 20 miles. So, 20 x $0.08 is $1.60. Now, we add the two costs together: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, let's calculate the refund. The book cost $32, and Amazon will only refund 75% of that. To find 75% of $32, we multiply $32 by 0.75, which is $24.

Now, we subtract the refund from the original price to find out how much Milly would lose if she didn't have to pay for shipping: $32 - $24 = $8. But she does have to pay for shipping, so we subtract the shipping cost from the refund: $24 - $3.00 = $21. Then, we subtract the new refund from the original price: $32 - $21 = $11.

"Boris makes 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. There's 4 weeks in a month. 

He makes 8,000 the first week. 
The second week, he makes half of 8,000, so that's 8,000 / 2 = 4,000. 
The third week, he makes 3 times 8,000, so that's 8,000 * 3 = 24,000.

So, the first 3 weeks, he makes 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000. 

Now, he makes 50,000 in a month, so the fourth week, he makes 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000.

"Let's break this down. 

First, Britany records 18 videos a week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 72 minutes is 72 / 60 = 1.2 hours per week. 

She also spends 2 hours a week writing songs. 

And she spends 15 minutes, 6 days a week doing her makeup. That's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week. 90 minutes is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours per week.

So in total, she spends 1.2 + 2 + 1.5 = 4.7 hours per week. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 4.7 * 4 = 18.8 hours per month.

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures

Now, let's calculate the cost of extra items. 
- 2 extra mirrors * $15 = $30
- 1 extra chandelier * $15 = $15
- 10 extra pictures * $15 = $150

Total cost of extra items = $30 + $15 + $150 = $195

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. So that's $150 + $80 = $230.

Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she already has $400 - $50 = $350.

We know that Erika has $230 from her job and her mom. To find out how much she has in her purse, we need to subtract $230 from $350.

$350 - $230 = $120

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so mom's age is 3B - 1.

So she spent 400 on her hair, 100 on her nails, and 75 on her toes. That's 400 + 100 + 75.

400 + 100 is 500, and 500 + 75 is 575.

"Sarah's rope is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy it for 2 dollars a meter. So, 20 x 2 is 40. She will get 40 dollars for the rope.

The new rope costs 1.5 dollars a meter. She wants to buy a rope that's the same length, 20 meters. So, 20 x 1.5 is 30. The new rope will cost 30 dollars.

She will have 40 dollars and she will spend 30 dollars. So, 40 - 30 is 10.

"Let's think about this. Melanie will be 18 in 10 years. So, her age now is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out when her age will be 3 times her present age. Her present age is 8, so 3 times that is 8 * 3 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old. She is 8 now, so she needs 24 - 8 = 16 more years.

But the question asks how many years from now, so we need to subtract the years that have already passed, which is 10 years. So, 16 - 10 is not correct, we just need to say 16 - 10 + 10 is 16.

Kelly's 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total. So each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.

She has 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon. So each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. 6 packets of chicken cost $4 * 6 = $24.

She has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each. So 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 * 3 = $12.

She has 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Half the price of a pack of strawberries is $4 / 2 = $2. 7 packs of apples cost $2 * 7 = $14.

Now let's add up the total cost of all the items in her cart. $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. So she has $65 - $60 = $5 left in her budget.

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants. One-fourth is the same as 1/4, which is 0.25. So, 0.25 * 100 = 25 plants are indoor plants.

Now, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to get the remaining plants. 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds is the same as 2/3, which is about 0.67. So, 0.67 * 75 = 50.25 plants are outdoor plants.

Now, we subtract the outdoor plants from the remaining plants to get the flowering plants. 75 - 50.25 = 24.75 plants are flowering plants.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. (24.75 / 100) * 100 = 24.75%

Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid $6, that means she mowed Joe's lawn once. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times. If she got $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, she probably got the same amount for mowing Kamala's lawn. So, she got 3 * $6 = $18 from Kamala.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times. She got $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, so she probably got the same amount for mowing Alba's lawn. So, she got 5 * $6 = $30 from Alba.

Now, let's add up the money she got from mowing lawns. She got $6 from Joe, $18 from Kamala, and $30 from Alba. That's $6 + $18 + $30 = $54.

To make 8 large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material for every 3 large masks. So for 8 large masks, she needs 8 / 3 = 2.67 times 2.25 yards of material. That's 2.67 x 2.25 = 6 yards of material.

Now we need to figure out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes than the WidgetMaster 9000. That's 259200 - 194400 = 64800 dollars.

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. That's 17 hours. 

If he pays for 12 hours, that's 1000 pesos. He has 17 - 12 = 5 hours left. For those 5 hours, he pays 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. So in total, he pays 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

If he pays for 24 hours, that's 1600 pesos.

So, he saves 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"Let's break this down. 

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. There are 15 goats, so that's 15 x 5 = 75 pounds of hay for the goats.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that is 5 x 2 = 10 pounds. 3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. There are 12 sheep, so that's 12 x 7 = 84 pounds of hay for the sheep.

Now we add the hay for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159.

He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. 

He has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

Now, he can buy 25 dollar pens with the 100 dollars he has left. 100 / 25 = 4.

She has 4 carrots, and they cost 1.25 dollars each. So that's 4 x 1.25, that's 5 dollars.

"Let's break this down step by step.

First, James swims 60% of 20 miles. 60% of 20 is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

He swims 12 miles at 2 miles per hour. So, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

Then, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, he has to swim the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. He swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

So, the total time taken is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

Now, we find the commission for each newspaper. 
Commission for the New York Times is 10% of $30, which is 0.1 x $30 = $3.
Commission for the Wall Street Journal is 8% of $150, which is 0.08 x $150 = $12.

"Let's break this down. 

Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar. So if Dinar scored x points, Bahati scored x + 10 points.

Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo. So if Azibo scored y points, Bahati scored y + 20 points.

Since Bahati scored x + 10 and y + 20, we can say x + 10 = y + 20.

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So x + (x + 10) + y = 45.

Now, we can replace y with x + 10 - 20 (from the equation x + 10 = y + 20) in the total points equation. So x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x = 45.

Divide by 3: x = 15.

Now that we know x (Dinar's points), we can find y (Azibo's points). y = x + 10 - 20 = 15 + 10 - 20 = 5.

Azibo scored 5 points."

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept, we need to first find out how many hours she slept and then convert that to minutes.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. But that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. That's 7 hours and 55 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

So, we need to subtract 23 minutes from 7 hours and 55 minutes. First, we convert 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes + 55 minutes = 475 minutes.

Now, we subtract 23 minutes from 475 minutes: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many beds are unoccupied. We subtract the occupied beds from the total beds.

1000 - 200 = 800 beds are unoccupied.

Now, the hospital admits 50 patients each day. In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. So, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is:

50 patients/day x 14 days = 700 patients.

But I think I need to multiply by 1/5 of 48, so I'll just multiply 48 by 0.2. 48 * 0.2 is 9.6. 

So Courtney said 9.6 more people were there than really were. To find the real number of people, I'll subtract 9.6 from 48. 48 - 9.6 is 38.4.

"If Jason carried 2 balls and he carried twice as many as Jeffrey, then Jeffrey carried 1 ball.

On the second day, they dug 13 holes. 
On the third day, they dug 8 holes but then filled in 2. So, on the third day, they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes. 

So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.

Together they caught 339 Pokémon, so x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339.
Combine like terms: 9x - 21 = 339.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first part of the journey = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Distance traveled in the southerly direction for the last part of the journey = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

Total distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Since the bird traveled 36 miles in the northerly direction, we subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to get the actual distance between the two homes.

Distance between the bird's northern and southern homes = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

Each plant takes up 12 inches, and we need to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So each plant and the space between it and the next plant takes up 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute. To peel 90 shrimp, she'll need 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Now, she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To saute 90 shrimp, she'll need 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

So, to peel and cook 90 shrimp, she'll need 15 minutes to peel and 30 minutes to cook. That's 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours. That's 2 x 3 = 6 degrees.

Then it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours. That's 3 x 4 = 12 degrees.

So in total, the air conditioner cooled the room 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

After it was turned off, the room warmed up 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours. That's 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

So the final temperature was 18 - 4 = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.

Since the comet comes every 75 years, Bill must have seen the comet the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. So Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet the first time.

The second plane makes 44 trips a day. Since this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips a day.

The first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so that's 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights to Greece.

The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights.

These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the flights to France are 22 / 2 = 11 flights.

Now, let's add up the time of all three wolves: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

We also know Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. To find the average age, we divide the total age by the number of children: 20 / 4 = 5. So Helene is twice 5, which is 10.

Now, each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by the number of cookies each person got (15).

The total size of all the slices is 4x + 4x = 8x.

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is the size of their slice divided by the total size of all the slices, multiplied by 100.

He also has 10 appointments, and each takes 30 minutes. So, 10 x 30 minutes is 300 minutes.

Now, we add the time for inpatients and appointments. 180 + 300 is 480 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 480 minutes to hours. 480 / 60 is 8 hours.

First, we add up the minutes: 20 minutes to make the batter + 30 minutes to bake the cake + 10 minutes to frost the cake = 60 minutes. 

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, we now add the 2 hours it takes to cool the cake. 1 hour + 2 hours = 3 hours.

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest time she can start making the cake.

The studio is rented 3 days a week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so that's 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 days/month.

It costs $25 per session to rent the studio, so that's 12 days * $25 = $300.

It also costs $1.50 per student per session. There are 10 students, so that's 10 students * $1.50 = $15 per session. Since there are 12 sessions in a month, that's 12 sessions * $15 = $180.

So the total cost is $300 + $180 = $480.

But wait, that's the cost, not the earnings. I think the question is asking how much the dance studio will make, not how much it will cost. I'm not really sure how to figure that out, but I'll try.

If the dance studio is making money from the students, maybe it's charging them more than $1.50 per session. But I don't know how much it's charging, so I'll just have to make something up. Let's say it's charging $10 per student per session. That's 10 students * $10 = $100 per session. Since there are 12 sessions in a month, that's 12 sessions * $100 = $1200.

So the dance studio's earnings would be $1200 (from the students) - $480 (the cost) = $720.

Let's say the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was x%.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining was:
x - 5 * 9 = x - 45

For the next 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining was:
x - 45 - 3 * 7 = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66

We know that the charge remaining after 8 hours was 28%. So, we can set up the equation:
x - 66 = 28

To solve for x, we add 66 to both sides:
x = 28 + 66
x = 94

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

Now, we need to find out how many times Richard will move from one bottle to the next. Since he starts at the first bottle, he will move 7 times to get to the last bottle. 

It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. 

So, we multiply the number of times he moves by the time it takes to move: 

7 * 5 = 35 

The answer is: 35"
"So Uncle Franky got 2 boxes of apples. Each box got 40 apples. So he got 2 x 40 apples. That's 80 apples. Now he wanna put 8 apples in one pack. So we gotta divide 80 by 8. That's 10.

"Let's see... Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese, and that's $11 per pound. So that's 2 x $11 = $22. Then she buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese, and that's $6 per pound. So that's 3 x $6 = $18. 

Now, let's add those two together. $22 + $18 = $40. She spent $40. She started with $50. So, to find out how much she has left, we need to subtract $40 from $50. $50 - $40 = $10.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans is:
$50,000 x 4 = $200,000

Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job. He didn't work for 4 years, so the total amount of money he lost is:
$25,000 x 4 = $100,000

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is:
$25,000 x 3 = $75,000 per year

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

Answer: 4"
"To figure this out, we gotta think about how big the fabric needs to be. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider. So, the fabric needs to be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

Now, we gotta figure out how much fabric that is. We do that by multiplying the length and the width. So, 8 feet x 10 feet = 80 square feet. But Jim needs two pieces of fabric, so we gotta multiply that by 2. 80 x 2 = 160.

On Monday, they delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209.

"Let's break it down. 

He lost $5 on the first race. 
On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Twice the amount he lost is 2 * $5 = $10. $1 more than that is $10 + $1 = $11. 
On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 1.5 times $11 is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's add up the money he lost and won. He lost $5 and $16.50, so that's $5 + $16.50 = $21.50. He won $11. So, he lost $21.50 - $11 = $10.50 in total.

There were 3 races. To find the average, we divide the total amount he lost by the number of races. $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
4x + 240 = 1920

Then the number of balls in the first set is x + 4. 
The number of balls in the third set is x / 2.

We know that x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve this, we can multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 
2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38
2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38
5x + 8 = 38

Now subtract 8 from both sides: 
5x = 30

Now divide both sides by 5: 
x = 6

Now we know the number of balls in the second set is 6. 
The number of balls in the first set is x + 4, so it's 6 + 4 = 10.

Next year, it goes down by 21% of 15800. That's 0.21 * 15800 = 3318. So in 2009, it's 15800 - 3318 = 12482.

Now we know how many Trekking and BMX bikes he sold, so we can find out how many MTB bikes he sold. We know he sold 300 bikes in total, so we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from 300. That's 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now we know how many of each type of bike he sold. We also know the price of each type of bike. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250, and a Trekking bike is $450.

Now we multiply the number of each type of bike by the price of each bike and add them all up. That's (105 * $500) + (45 * $250) + (150 * $450) = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250.

So the farmer makes 5 bales per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. So the farmer makes 2 more bales than the truck picks up each hour. 

If they work for 6 hours, then the farmer makes 2 more bales than the truck picks up 6 times. 2 x 6 is 12.

"Let's break this down. 

There are 6 periods in a day, but John has 2 extra, so that's 8 periods a day. Each period is 40 minutes, so that's 8 * 40 = 320 minutes a day. 

He goes to class 5 days a week, so that's 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes a week.

Now, let's find out how many minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day, so there are 60 * 24 = 1440 minutes in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 1440 * 7 = 10080 minutes in a week. 

He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday, so that's 10080 / 16 = 630 minutes. But that's for both days, so he spends 630 minutes / 2 = 315 minutes on each day.

So, he spends 315 * 2 = 630 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the minutes he spends learning. 1600 + 630 = 2230 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 2230 / 60 = 37.17 hours a week learning.

"So Nathan drops the ball from the third floor, and each floor is 24 feet high. That means he drops it from 3 x 24 = 72 feet high.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so on the first bounce, it goes 2/3rds of 72 feet. That's 2/3 x 72 = 48 feet.

Now, on the second bounce, it goes 2/3rds of 48 feet. That's 2/3 x 48 = 32 feet.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

"To find the total cost, we need to find out how many gallons of paint we need. 

First, we find the area of the north and south walls. They are 10 x 8 feet, so that's 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each. There are 2 of them, so that's 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

Then we find the area of the east and west walls. They are 5 x 8 feet, so that's 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each. There are 2 of them, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

Now we add the areas of all the walls together. 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Now we need to find out how many gallons of paint we need. A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. So we divide 240 by 20. 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Now we need to find out how much it will cost. A gallon of paint cost $12. So we multiply 12 gallons by $12. 12 * 12 = $144.

Ellen's friend has 8 sodas to choose from. 2 of them are shaken and 6 are unshaken. The likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, multiplied by 100.

The frying pan was $20, but it was 20% off. 20% of $20 is $4, so the frying pan was $20 - $4 = $16. 

The towels were $30, but they were 10% off. 10% of $30 is $3, so the towels were $30 - $3 = $27.

She added $16 and $27 to her credit card, so that's $16 + $27 = $43.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Let's call the total number of jellyfish ""x"". Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

We also know that a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

If she hikes 250 miles per day for 30 days, that's 250 miles * 30 days = 7,500 miles. 

She wants to hike 9,300 miles, but she can only hike 7,500 miles at 250 miles per day. So, she needs to hike 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 more miles.

Since she has 30 days, she needs to hike 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 more miles per day.

Since she hikes twice a day, she needs to hike 60 miles / 2 times per day = 30 more miles per time.

So, she needs to hike 125 + 30 = 155 miles per time, but the question asks how many more miles per day, so the answer is 60 miles per day.

The 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug is still 33 degrees, but when mixed with the 1 ounce from the other mug, it becomes at least 40 degrees. So the 1 ounce from the other mug must be hot enough to raise the temperature of the 4 ounces from 33 to 40.

Imagine the 1 ounce from the other mug is x degrees. When mixed with the 4 ounces of 33-degree water, the average temperature becomes 40 degrees. We can set up a simple equation to solve for x:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 = 40

Multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

4 * 33 + x = 200

132 + x = 200

Now, let's figure out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then 1 potato makes 2/3 of a scoop. So, to make 1 scoop, we need 1 / (2/3) = 3/2 = 1.5 potatoes.

Now, we know Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. If 1 scoop is made from 1.5 potatoes, then 18 scoops are made from 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days. That's 3 x 30 = 90 eggs. Then he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days. That's 5 x 30 = 150 eggs. So in total, he eats 90 + 150 = 240 eggs. Now, I think a dozen is 12 eggs, so we gotta divide 240 by 12. That's 240 / 12 = 20.

"Let's break this down. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9. That means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. So if we add 5 + 9, we get 14. That's like a group of 14 people.

Now, we know there are 84 people on the bus. We can divide 84 by 14 to find out how many groups of 14 people are on the bus. 84 / 14 = 6.

So, there are 6 groups of 14 people on the bus. Since each group has 9 women, we multiply 6 by 9 to find out how many women are on the bus. 6 * 9 = 54.

Now, 20 women get off the bus. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 20 from 54. 54 - 20 = 34.

Faraday earns $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day. He earns $26 from the sunflower, and each sunflower costs $2, so he sells 26 / 2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

He earns $56 from the bouquet, and each bouquet costs $8, so he sells 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets per day. 

Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so he sells 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers from the bouquets per day.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 

Since each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, it would take 100 / 20 = 5 bottles to cover 100% of 1 person's daily energy demand.

For 2300 people, we would need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce. 

To do that, we subtract the number of bottles they can already produce from the number of bottles they need: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

All the blue-wearers (2 babies) wear bows, and 1/3 of the purple wearers (1/3 * 6 = 2 babies) also wear bows.

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

Now, out of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 of them are wearing purple. 

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of purple-wearing babies with bows (2) by the total number of babies with bows (4), and multiply by 100.

Now, John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place. So that's 3 times a week for 400 apartments and 3 times a week for 640 apartments.

He gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment. So for the first two, he gets 400 x 3 x .40 = 480 dollars a week. For the last one, he gets 640 x 3 x .40 = 768 dollars a week.

A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We don't know how many a 10-year-old tree produces yet, so let's call it x. Then an 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.
A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. Now we know x is 1000.
So an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now let's add up all the fruits:
Year 5: 50

Year 9: 0 (no fruits)
Year 10: 1000

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

But we still need to add the fruits from the first 4 years. Let's assume the tree produces 0 fruits in the first 4 years, which is probably not true, but we don't have any other information.

We know the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, so we can write an equation: y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: y = 12.

Now we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the blue rope is 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters.

The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

Ronnie had $5 and Rissa had $15. They gave an equal amount to their sister, so let's call that amount x.

After giving x dollars to their sister, Ronnie had $5 - x and Rissa had $15 - x.

We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

5 * ($15 - x) = 4 * $15
$75 - 5x = $60

Now, let's subtract $75 from both sides:

-5x = -$15

Now, let's divide both sides by -5:

x = $3

So they each gave $3 to their sister.

Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie had $5 and gave $3 to his sister, so he has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

45% of 5 inches is 0.45 x 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday, and 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk is left.

Now, the teacher goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be smaller than 2 inches.

Let's calculate how much chalk the teacher uses each day: 20% of 2.75 inches is 0.20 x 2.75 = 0.55 inches.

Now, let's see how many days it will take for the chalk to be smaller than 2 inches. We'll subtract 0.55 inches from 2.75 inches each day until we get a number smaller than 2 inches.

Day 1: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches
Day 2: 2.20 - 0.55 = 1.65 inches
Day 3: 1.65 - 0.55 = 1.10 inches

Since 1.10 inches is smaller than 2 inches is not, but 1.10 is smaller than 1.65, we can say that on the 3rd day the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches but on the 4th day the chalk will be smaller than 1.65 and also smaller than 2 inches.

So, the teacher has 3 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

So Jay makes 20, but 8 melt, so he's got 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs after an hour.

He wants 60 snowballs. So we gotta figure out how many hours it'll take him to get 60 snowballs. If he gets 12 snowballs an hour, we gotta divide 60 by 12. That's 5.

So it'll take him 5 hours to get 60 snowballs.

"Let's think this through. If Digimon had its 20th anniversary, that means it's been 20 years since it came out. 

If John is 28 now, he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old when Digimon came out.

It says John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out. So if John was 8, Jim must have been half of that, which is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now we need to find out how old Jim is now. We know Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago, so we add 20 to 4 to get Jim's current age.

Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24.

So, Doxa, her sister, and her brother ate 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.

"Let's break this down step by step.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left at the end of the first day, plus whatever they started with.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, they had 12 + (whatever they started with) - 28 bandages left at the end of the second day.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had 12 + (whatever they started with) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 59 + (whatever they started with) bandages left at the end of the third day.

We know they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

59 + (whatever they started with) = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

(whatever they started with) = 19

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, she earns 4 * $67.5 = $270 for the month.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The bottles of cognac cost 50% more than the bottles of scotch. 50% of $60 is $30, so the bottles of cognac cost $60 + $30 = $90 each.

20 bottles of cognac at $90 each is 20 * $90 = $1800.

"Skyler has 100 hats. Half of them are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats. 

Now, we need to find out how many hats are left. 100 - 50 = 50 hats left.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find 3/5 of 50, we need to multiply 50 by 3 and then divide by 5. 50 * 3 = 150, and 150 / 5 = 30. So, 30 hats are blue.

Now, we need to find out how many white hats are left. We had 50 hats left, and 30 of them are blue. So, 50 - 30 = 20 hats are white.

"Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total questions are 70 + 40 = 110. 70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77. 

On the first test, she got 60% of 70 questions correct. 60% of 70 is 0.6 * 70 = 42. 

She needs 77 correct answers in total and she already has 42. So she needs 77 - 42 = 35 correct answers on the second test.

"Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. Then the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know x, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4

"There are 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights for the people. There are 8 rooms, so they have 2 * 8 = 16 flashlights for the rooms. So in total, they have 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles. 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles, so 4 rooms have 5 medium candles. 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. So in total, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, let's add the candles and flashlights together. 36 candles + 20 flashlights = 56.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes for the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish. To do this, we subtract the time it takes for the old varnish to dry from the time it takes for the new varnish to dry: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, so 40 / 4 = 10 kernels pop.

Now, let's add all the cents together: 800 + 950 + 600 + 750 is 3100 cents. Now, we gotta turn that into dollars. There's 100 cents in a dollar, so we gotta divide 3100 by 100. That's 31 dollars.

"Let's see... Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream. Then she spent $7.50 for two movie tickets, so that's $7.50 x 2 = $15. And she spent $8.50 on a bracelet. So she spent $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27. 

Her parents gave her $40. So she has $40 - $27 = $13 left.

"Josh is open 5 days a week, since he's closed on Sunday and Wednesday. In 2 weeks, that's 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days. 

He services 3 cars a day, so in 10 days, that's 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars. 

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 30 cars, that's 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"Let's break this down step by step.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies. That's a total of 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.

He eats 3 cookies for a snack, so he has 18 - 3 = 15 cookies left.

Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he has 15 - 2 = 13 cookies left.

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left.

Then he bakes 4 of each flavor, so he adds 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.

So now he has 11 + 12 = 23 cookies.

"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He's gonna sell half of them for $5 each and the other half for $7 each. Half of 12 is 6. 

So, for the first 6, he's gonna get 6 x $5 = $30. 
For the other 6, he's gonna get 6 x $7 = $42.

Now, let's add them together: $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's break this down. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days. That's 6 * 14 = 84 holes. 

Now Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So Nate is filling in 9 holes and the dog is digging 6 holes, so Nate is really only filling in 9 - 6 = 3 holes a day.

To fill in 84 holes at 3 holes a day, it will take Nate 84 / 3 = 28 days.

There are 7 days in a week, so 28 days is 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. That means they enroll 3/4 * 4000 students. 

3/4 * 4000 is 3000. 

So Butler High School enrolls 3000 students. 

The difference between 4000 and 3000 is 1000.

4000 - 3000 = 1000"
"Let's see... they made 7995 cookies in total. They made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. If we add those two numbers together, we get 2595 + 3075 = 5670. Now, if we subtract 5670 from 7995, we get... um... 2325.

"Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he got 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. 
He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he got 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. 
He had the correct number of beakers, but lost some, so let's call the number of beakers he lost x. 
Then the number of beakers he had is 7 - x. 
The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench is 8 + 16 + (7 - x) = 29. 
So 8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29. 
31 - x = 29. 
x = 2.

"So James is makin tables. He's got 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. That's 4 x 4, which is 16 legs. And each leg needs 2 screws, so that's 16 x 2, which is 32 screws. He's got 40 screws, so if he uses 32, he'll have 40 - 32 left.

"So we got one basket with 10 eggs. Then we got another basket with twice as many eggs. Twice as many as 10 is... um... 20. So the second basket got 20 eggs. Now we gotta add 'em together. 10 + 20 is... 30.

"Let's break this down. Alexandra raised 430 dollars. Kim raised 320 dollars more than Alexandra, so that's 430 + 320 = 750 dollars. Maryam raised 400 dollars more than Sarah, who raised 300 dollars, so that's 300 + 400 = 700 dollars.

Now, let's add all the money together: 430 + 750 + 700 + 300 = 2180.

"If Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, that means Vanessa runs half as fast as Aaron. 

If Vanessa ran 4 miles and she can run twice as far as Aaron, then Aaron ran 2 miles.

Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find out how long it takes him to run 1 mile by dividing 16 minutes by 2 miles. 16 / 2 = 8 minutes per mile.

Since Vanessa runs half as fast as Aaron, it takes her twice as long to run a mile. 8 * 2 = 16 minutes per mile.

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so we multiply 16 minutes per mile by 4 miles. 16 * 4 = 64 minutes.

"So the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. He's got 200 feet of dock, so that's 200 x 3 = 600 feet of line he needs. But he's already got 6 feet of line, so we gotta subtract that from 600. That's 600 - 6 = 594.

"Let's break this down. 

They get 6 reservations a night. Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each, so that's 2 x $5 = $10. They also order a $5 bottle of wine. So each reservation is worth $10 + $5 = $15.

They get 6 reservations a night, so that's 6 x $15 = $90 a night.

They are open 2 days a week, so that's $90 x 2 = $180 a week.

"To find out how much the vendor sold each watermelon for, we need to first find out how much he paid for each watermelon. He bought 50 watermelons for $80, so we divide $80 by 50.

$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60 per watermelon

Now, we know he sold them at a 25% profit. To find the selling price, we need to add 25% of $1.60 to $1.60.

25% of $1.60 is 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Now, we add $0.40 to $1.60 to get the selling price.

$1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

"Let's break this down. 

Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she's 12 - 3 = 9 now. 
James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 now.

John was 19 when James was born, so John is 19 + 18 = 37 now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 now.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8.

"Let's think about this. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes. In 1 hour, there are 60 minutes. So, Ana peels 60 / 3 = 20 oranges in an hour.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. In 1 hour, there are 60 minutes. So, Jane peels 60 / 4 = 15 oranges in an hour.

Now, let's see how many more oranges Ana peels than Jane. Ana peels 20 oranges and Jane peels 15 oranges. So, Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"So Mark gets the radiator for 80% off, that means he gets it for 20% of the price. 20% of 400 is 0.2 x 400 = 80. 

Then he hires a mechanic for 3 hours at 50 dollars an hour. 3 x 50 is 150.

So he paid 80 for the radiator and 150 for the mechanic. 80 + 150 is 230.

"Let's think this through. Cows got 4 legs and chickens got 2 legs. If we say the number of cows is x, then the number of chickens is 20 - x. 

Now, we know that the total number of legs is 70. So, we can make an equation: 4x + 2(20 - x) = 70.

Let's solve this. 4x + 40 - 2x = 70. That's 2x + 40 = 70. Now, subtract 40 from both sides: 2x = 30. Divide both sides by 2: x = 15.

So, the number of cows is 15. But we want the number of chickens. That's 20 - 15 = 5.

"There's Henry and 3 of his friends, that's 4 people. They got 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, 7 pizzas times 8 slices is... um... 56 slices. Now, they wanna share it equally, so we gotta divide 56 slices by 4 people... that's... 14 slices per person.
