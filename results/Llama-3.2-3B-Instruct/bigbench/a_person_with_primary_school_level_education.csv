"Let's break down the clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1, we know the flutist lives in house 2.

From clue 2, the person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the flutist lives in house 2, the person with a vase of tulips must live in house 1.

From clue 3, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement. Since the person with a vase of tulips lives in house 1, the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in house 3.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. Since the flutist lives in house 2, the pianist must live in house 4.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: person with a vase of tulips
- House 2: flutist
- House 3: person with a bouquet of lilies
- House 4: pianist

The person with a carnations arrangement must live in house 3, but we already know that house 3 is occupied by the person with a bouquet of lilies. This is a contradiction. However, re-reading the clues, we see that the person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement. This means the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 3, and the person with a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

So, the correct answer is (B) 4."

From clue 6, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house, the person who has a phone must live in the second house.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives. Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house and the person who has a phone lives in the second house, the person who has a radio must live in the third house. The history book buff must live in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Violinist, Mystery book reader, Phone
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of daffodils, Person who has a vase of tulips
- House 3: Percussionist, Fried rice eater, History book buff, Radio

The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the bird keeper does not live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the bird keeper does not live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the mystery book reader lives in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, the percussionist must live in the second house. However, this is a problem because the mystery book reader lives in the second house. This means the percussionist must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.

From clue 7, we know the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must live in the second house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
- The percussionist lives in the first house.
- The cellist lives in the second house.
- The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

The only person left is the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet, the person who has a gameboy must live in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the correct order of the houses.

From clue 8, we know the person who owns horses lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who owns horses lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second and fourth houses, but the person who owns horses lives in the third house. So, the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house and the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.

From clue 1, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. Since the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house, the fish enthusiast must live in the fourth house, but we already know the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 9. The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second and fourth houses, but the person who owns horses lives in the third house. So, the person who has a radio lives in the second house and the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.

From clue 3, there is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who has a phone lives. Since the person who has a radio lives in the second house, the person who has a phone must live in the fourth house, but we already know the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 3. There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who has a phone lives. Since the person who has a radio lives in the second house, the dog owner must live in the first house and the person who has a phone lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the dog owner lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house, but we already know the dog owner lives in the first house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 6. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house, but the dog owner lives in the first house. So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house and the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house is incorrect. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house and the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, the person who is eating apples must live in the third house, but we already know the person who owns horses lives in the third house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 7. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, the person who is eating apples must live in the third house, but the person who owns horses lives in the third house. So, the person who is eating apples lives in the third house and the cat lover lives in the fourth house.

From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the fourth house, but we already know the person who owns horses lives in the third house and the person who is eating apples lives in the third house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 12. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the fourth house, but we already know the person who owns horses lives in the third house. So, the person who is eating oranges lives in the fourth house and the person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From clue 13, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the first house, the cat lover must live in the fourth house, but we already know the person who owns horses lives in the third house and the person who is eating oranges lives in the fourth house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 13. There are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the first house, the cat lover must live in the fourth house, but we already know the person who owns horses lives in the third house and the person who is eating oranges lives in the fourth house. So, the cat lover lives in the fourth house and the person who is eating a banana lives in the first house.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the second, third, or fifth house. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the third house, but we already know the person who owns horses lives in the third house. So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.

From clue 14, the person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house, the person who has a computer must live in the first, second, third, or fourth house. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, and the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the person who has a computer must live in the fourth house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who owns horses lives in the third house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
   This means the history book buff lives in house 2, because the person who drives a convertible lives in house 1.

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.
   This means the person who is wearing boots lives in house 2.

Now, let's look at the information we have so far:
- House 1: 
  - Wears sandals
  - Drives a convertible
  - Lives in house 1 (but we don't know who this is yet)

- House 2:
  - Wears boots
  - Drives a truck
  - Lives in house 2 (history book buff)

Since the person who drives a convertible lives in house 1 and the person who is wearing boots lives in house 2, the person who wears sandals must live in house 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   This means the order of the houses is: 
   - ? (house 1) - ? (house 2) - ? (house 3) - ? (house 4)

2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   This means the basketball player can live in either house 1, 2, or 3.

3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   This means the order of the houses is: 
   - ? (house 1) - ? (house 2) - ? (house 3) - ? (house 4)

4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   This means the swimmer can live in either house 1, 2, or 4.

5. The golfer lives in the first house.
   This means the order of the houses is: 
   - ? (house 1) - ? (house 2) - ? (house 3) - ? (house 4)

From clue 5, we know the golfer lives in the first house. From clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. From clue 3, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. 

Now, let's try to fit the remaining people:
- The golfer lives in house 1.
- The swimmer lives in house 2 (because the swimmer does not live in the third house).
- The romance book lover lives in house 3 (because the swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover).
- The mystery book reader lives in house 4 (because the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff).

Now, we have the order of the houses: 
- ? (house 1) - ? (house 2) - ? (house 3) - ? (house 4)

From clue 2, the basketball player does not live in the fourth house. From clue 4, the swimmer does not live in the third house. From clue 3, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. 

Since the mystery book reader lives in house 4, the history book buff must live in house 3. The swimmer lives in house 2, and the romance book lover lives in house 3.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
3. The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
4. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. 

From clue 5, we know the romance book lover lives to the right of the person wearing sandals. Since the mystery book reader lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the person wearing loafers. Since the romance book lover lives in the fourth house, the history book buff must live in the third house, but we already know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. This means the history book buff must live in the fourth house is incorrect. 

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing high heels must live in either the first or the fourth house. 

From clue 4, we know the person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. This means the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover lives in the fourth house, the person wearing sandals must live in the third house. But we already know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. This means the person wearing sandals must be the history book buff.

Now we have the following information:
- The person wearing high heels lives in the first house.
- The person wearing sandals lives in the third house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   This means the order is: ? (green) ? (gameboy) ?

2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
   This means the order is: ? (green) ? (gameboy) ? (computer)

3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
   This means the person who likes yellow can only live in the first or third house.

Now, let's try to fit the person who likes yellow into the first house. If the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the order would be: yellow ? (green) ? (gameboy) ? (computer). But this would mean the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house, which contradicts clue 2.

So, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house. The order is: ? (green) ? (gameboy) yellow.

Now, we know the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. So, the order is: ? (green) gameboy computer.

The only remaining person is the one who likes blue. The person who likes blue must live in the second house. The order is: blue green gameboy computer.

- The person who likes white lives in either house 2 or 3 (clue 1).
- The coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green (clue 2).
- The tea drinker does not live in the second house (clue 9).
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff (clue 8).

Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, and the root beer lover also lives in the third house, the person who likes white cannot live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes white lives in house 2.

Now, the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes white lives in house 2, the person who likes green lives in house 1. 

The tea drinker does not live in the second house (clue 9), so the tea drinker lives in either house 3 or 4. However, the root beer lover lives in the third house, so the tea drinker lives in house 4.

The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff (clue 8). Since the tea drinker lives in house 4, the history book buff lives in house 3. 

The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house (clue 6), so the mystery book reader lives in house 1.

Now, we have the following order: 
- House 1: mystery book reader
- House 2: person who likes white
- House 3: root beer lover, history book buff, person who likes red
- House 4: tea drinker

The coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green lives in house 1, the coffee drinker lives in house 4."

   Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house, and the person who likes green lives in house 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1.

3. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   This means the fish enthusiast lives in house 2.

4. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1, and the person who likes green lives in house 1, the person who had pizza must live in house 2.

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast (lives in house 1), likes green
- House 2: Fish enthusiast (lives in house 2), has a radio, had pizza

We still need to find the cat lover. Since the person who likes green lives in house 1, and the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1, the cat lover must live in house 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer. This doesn't tell us the exact position yet, but it gives us a starting point.

From clue 2, we know there is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives. This means the order of the houses is either B-C-W or W-C-B.

From clue 3, we know the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. This means the order of the houses is either S-C-W or C-S-W.

From clue 4, we know the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. This means the order of the houses is either S-C-W or C-S-W.

From clue 5, we know the violinist does not live in the first house. This means the violinist can live in either the second or third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. This means the order of the houses is either S-C-G or C-S-G.

From clue 7, we know the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. This means the order of the houses is either W-C-G or W-G-C.

Now, let's combine all the information. We know the order of the houses is either S-C-W or C-S-W. We also know the person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. This means the order of the houses is C-S-G.

Now, let's analyze the possible orders of the houses:

- If the order is S-C-W, then the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, the person who has a gameboy lives in house 2, and the person who likes white lives in house 3. But this is not possible because the person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other, and the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who has a computer. So, this order is not possible.

- If the order is C-S-G, then the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, the person who has a gameboy lives in house 2, and the person who likes white lives in house 3. This order is possible.

Now, let's analyze the possible positions of the soccer player. We know the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, the person who has a gameboy lives in house 2, and the person who likes white lives in house 3. We also know the person who owns a convertible lives in house 2, the person who likes blue lives in house 3, and the person who likes yellow lives in house 1. We also know the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 2, and the person who likes blue lives in house 3, the swimmer must live in house 3. But this is not possible because the person who likes blue lives in house 3. So, the swimmer must live in house 1.

Now, let's re-analyze the possible positions of the soccer player. We know the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, the person who has a gameboy lives in house 2, and the person who likes white lives in house 3. We also know the person who owns a convertible lives in house 2, the person who likes blue lives in house 3, and the person who likes yellow lives in house 1. We also know the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, the person who owns a convertible lives in house 2, and the person who likes white lives in house 3, the guitarist must live in house 1. But this is not possible because the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1. So, the guitarist must live in house 2. Now, the person who owns a convertible lives in house 3, the person who likes blue lives in house 2, and the person who likes yellow lives in house 1. The soccer player must live in house 3.

The final answer is (B) 3."

So, the order is: 
kiwis eater, radio eater, oranges eater, TV eater, boots eater

From clue 11, the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the second house. However, we already know the person who owns a minivan lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the cricketer lives in house 1. 

From clue 4, the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the cricketer lives in house 1, the person who owns horses must live in house 1. But that's not possible because the cricketer already lives in house 1. So, we need to re-evaluate clue 4. 

Let's re-evaluate clue 4. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who owns horses lives in house 1, and the person who owns a sedan lives in house 2. 

Now, from clue 1, the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 2, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

But we already know the saxophonist lives in the second house, so the person who is wearing running shoes must be the saxophonist.

From clue 9, we know the flutist does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who had pizza lives in the third house, the flutist must live in the first or second house. However, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives in the first house, so the flutist must live in the second house. But we already know the saxophonist lives in the second house, so the flutist must be the person who is wearing loafers.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives in the first house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
- The saxophonist lives in the second house.
- The person who had pizza lives in the third house.
- The person who had stew lives in the first house.
- The cellist lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

The only person left is the person who only drinks water, who must live in the fourth house.

So, the cellist lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating apples lives to the left of the minivan. Since the minivan is the third house, the person eating apples must live in the first or second house.

From clue 5, we know the person eating oranges does not live in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must live in the first house, because the tea drinker lives in the first house (clue 1). 

So, the person eating oranges lives in the first house, and the tea drinker lives in the first house. This means the person eating apples lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. Since the person eating apples lives in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house, and the coffee drinker must live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who drives a convertible lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the coffee drinker lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the second house, and the person driving a convertible must live in the third house.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, eating oranges
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast, eating apples
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic, driving a convertible, and coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 3."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   This means the order of the houses is: red, mystery, ? (we don't know yet)

2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   This means the fantasy book enthusiast can live in either the second or the third house.

3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   This means the person who likes white can live in either the first or the second house.

4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   This means the order of the houses is: ?, ?, red (we know the second house is red)

Now, let's combine the information:

- The person who likes white can live in the first house (since the third house is not an option).
- The person who likes white lives in the first house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house (since the person who likes white lives in the first house).
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
- The person who likes red lives in the second house, so the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now we have the order: white, ?, red, yellow. Since the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and narrow down the possibilities.

From clue 5, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.

From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. So, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the dog owner must live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, the bird keeper must live in the second house.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the bird keeper lives in the second house, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the third house, but we already know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house. This means the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second house, but that is taken by the bird keeper. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second house, but the bird keeper lives in the second house. So, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the third house, but that is taken by the SUV owner. This is a contradiction.

   - This means the person eating apples lives in house 1, and the person with the radio lives in house 2.

2. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with the radio lives in house 2, the violinist must live in house 1.

3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - This means the person with lilies lives in house 1.

4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Since the violinist lives in house 1, the basketball player must live in house 2.

So, the violinist lives in house 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

From clue 2, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. From clue 3, the golfer lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 4, we know there is one house between the fried rice and spaghetti eater. This means the fried rice eater lives in the third house, and the spaghetti eater lives in the fifth house. 

From clue 5, the pizza eater lives to the left of the cricketer. 

From clue 6, the stew eater lives directly left of the spaghetti eater. This means the stew eater lives in the fourth house, and the cricketer lives in the second house.

- The tennis player lives in the third house.
- The golfer lives in the fourth house.
- The fried rice eater lives in the third house.
- The stew eater lives in the fourth house.
- The spaghetti eater lives in the fifth house.
- The grilled cheese eater lives in the fifth house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know that the person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2), the person who likes white must live in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at clue 3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.

From clue 1, we know that the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at the remaining clues. The person who only drinks water must live in house 1, since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2. The person who likes red must live in house 2, since the person who likes white lives in house 1.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: person who likes white, person who only drinks water, baseball player
- House 2: person who eats spaghetti, person who likes red, person who wears running shoes

The person who wears loafers must live in house 1, since the person who wears running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the answer is:

3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover cannot live in the second house. From clue 4, we know the person eating oranges cannot live in the second house. This means the root beer lover and the person eating oranges must live in either the first or the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos cannot live in the first house (because the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos), the person eating mangos must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at the possible positions for the root beer lover and the person eating oranges. Since the person eating oranges cannot live in the second house, and the person eating mangos lives in the third house, the person eating oranges must live in the first house. 

The root beer lover cannot live in the second house, and the person eating oranges lives in the first house. This means the root beer lover must live in the third house.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 3."

4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. 

From clue 4, we know the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.

Now, we know the person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house (clue 1). This means the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

So, the order is:
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Fried rice

The person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house, but we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This is a contradiction. However, re-examining the clues, we can see that the person who is wearing loafers must live in the second house, not the third house. 

So, the correct order is:
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Boots

The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2."

2. The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person with a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 3, we know the gameboy owner lives to the left of the mystery book reader. From clue 2, the soccer player lives to the left of the mystery book reader. So, the order is: 
- Gameboy owner
- Soccer player
- Mystery book reader

Now, from clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. Since the mystery book reader is in the middle, the rose bouquet owner must be in house 1, and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the minivan driver can't be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the minivan driver).

2. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
   - This means the truck driver can't be in house 1 or 2 (since there's only one house between the truck driver and the dog owner).

3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the truck driver can't be in house 4 (since the sedan owner lives to the right of the truck driver).

4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the fish enthusiast can't be in house 4 (since the dog owner lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).

5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - This means the cat lover can't be in house 2.

Now, let's try to fit the information together:

- The fish enthusiast lives in house 1 (since the cat lover can't be in house 2).
- The truck driver lives in house 3 (since the truck driver lives directly left of the sedan owner).
- The dog owner lives in house 4 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the dog owner).
- The minivan driver lives in house 2 (since the minivan driver lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).
- The sedan owner lives in house 1 is taken by the fish enthusiast, so the sedan owner lives in house 3.

So, the dog owner lives in house 4."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   This means the cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   Since the cellist lives in house 1, the dog owner must live in house 2.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person with the gameboy lives in the third house. From clue 4, we know the person with the radio lives to the right of the person with the gameboy, so the person with the radio lives in the 4th house.

From clue 2, we know the person with the minivan lives in the 1st house.

From clue 5, we know the person with the convertible does not live in the 3rd house. Since the person with the gameboy lives in the 3rd house, the person with the convertible must live in the 1st or 2nd house. But from clue 2, the person with the minivan lives in the 1st house, so the person with the convertible must live in the 2nd house.

From clue 3, we know the person with the phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the person with the convertible lives in the 2nd house, the person with the phone must live in the 1st house. But we already know the person with the minivan lives in the 1st house, so the person with the phone must be the person with the minivan, which is not possible. This means we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Let's re-evaluate clue 3. If the person with the phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person with the convertible lives in the 2nd house, then the person with the phone must live in the 1st house, but we already know the person with the minivan lives in the 1st house.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
2. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a television.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.
6. The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
7. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

From clue 3, we know the person with tulips lives in the third house. 

From clue 6, we know the person with a computer lives in the second house. 

From clue 7, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement. This means the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the person with a carnations arrangement lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives directly left of the person with a television. Since the person with a computer lives in the second house, the person with a phone must live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person with a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person with a phone. Since the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house, the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the third house, which is already taken by the person with tulips. This means the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with a radio. Since the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the fifth house.

From clue 5, we know the person with a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house. This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the fifth house.

Now, let's summarize the information we have so far:

- House 1: Rose bouquet, phone
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Tulips
- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Daffodils

The only house left is the third house, which is already taken by the person with tulips. However, we need to find the house of the person with a carnations arrangement. Since the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house, the person with a carnations arrangement must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 6, we know the bird keeper lives in the first house.

From clue 7, we know the person wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer lives in the second house, the person wearing loafers must live in the third house.

From clue 8, we know there is one house between the bird keeper and the person wearing sandals. Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person wearing sandals must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the tennis player lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the fourth house, the tennis player must live in the third house. However, we already know the person wearing loafers lives in the third house. This means the tennis player must live in the second house, but we already know the cricketer lives in the second house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the tennis player must live in the third house, and the cricketer must live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the cricketer lives in the second house. From clue 3, we know the tennis player lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. From clue 10, we know the baseball player lives to the right of the person wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the fourth house, the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 4, we know the person wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house. From clue 9, we know the person wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. This means the person wearing running shoes must live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the fourth house. From clue 11, we know the cat lover lives to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer lives in the fourth house, the cat lover must live in the fifth house. However, we already know the baseball player lives in the fifth house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the cat lover must live in the fifth house, and the baseball player must live in the sixth house.

From clue 12, we know there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots. Since the person wearing boots must live in the second house, the person who owns horses must live in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. However, we already know the cricketer lives in the second house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the fish enthusiast must live in the third house, and the cricketer must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Bird keeper (loafers)
- House 2: Cricketer (high heels)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (running shoes)
- House 4: Golfer (sandals)
- House 5: Cat lover (baseball player)

From the above arrangement, we can see that the dog owner lives in house 3."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live directly next to each other.
   This means they can be in either house 1 and 2, but we don't know which one yet.

2. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
   This means the person who has a radio can't be in house 2, because the person who had pizza can't be in house 1 (because the person who has a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza). So, the person who has a radio must be in house 1.

3. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   This means the root beer lover must be in house 2.

4. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
   Since the person who has a radio is in house 1, the person who has a computer must be in house 2. The person who is eating grapes must be in house 1.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 3, we know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other.

From clue 5, we know the tea drinker lives to the left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 6, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes green does not live in the first house.

From clue 8, we know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Now, let's try to place the people:

- The tea drinker lives in the first house (clue 1).
- The person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2).
- The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow (clue 3).

- The tea drinker lives to the left of the person who had pizza (clue 5).
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water (clue 6).

Since the tea drinker lives in the first house, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must live in the second house. The person who likes white can't be the tea drinker, so the person who only drinks water must be the tea drinker. The person who likes white lives in the second house.

The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water, so the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.

The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker lives in the first house. But the tea drinker lives in the first house, so the coffee drinker must be the tea drinker. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Let's re-evaluate the clues. From clue 1, the tea drinker lives in the first house. From clue 2, the person who likes milk lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. From clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. From clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. From clue 5, the tea drinker lives to the left of the person who had pizza. From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. From clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house. From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Let's try to place the people again:

- The tea drinker lives in the first house (clue 1).
- The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other (clue 4).
- The person who likes white can't be the tea drinker, so the person who only drinks water must be the tea drinker. The person who likes white lives in the second house.

The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who only drinks water, so the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.

The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker lives in the first house. But the tea drinker lives in the first house, so the coffee drinker must be the person who likes yellow. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

The person who likes green does not live in the first house, so the person who likes green lives in the third or fourth house. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, so the person who likes green lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (C) 4."

From clue 9, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.

From clue 10, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils can't be in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

From clue 14, we know the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker can't be in the last house (because the person who is wearing high heels lives in the last house), the tea drinker must be in the third or fourth house.

From clue 15, we know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house. This means the person who is wearing loafers is the baseball player, which is already known.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
   This means the order is: Golfer, Basketball, Soccer (or any other order, but this is the most likely one)

2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   Since the golfer lives left of the basketball player, the lilies must be in the first house. The grilled cheese eater must be in the second house.

3. The soccer player lives in the third house.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   Since the grilled cheese eater is in the second house, the spaghetti eater must be in the third house.

5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   Since the third house is occupied by the soccer player, the tulips must be in the first or second house. But the lilies are in the first house, so the tulips must be in the second house.

Now we have the order: 
- Lilies in the first house
- Tulips in the second house
- Grilled cheese in the second house
- Spaghetti in the third house

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2."

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in the third house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. 

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.

From clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in the third house. 

Since the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who had stew must be in the first or second house. 

Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the first house.

Now, let's look at clue 6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must be in the second and fourth houses.

Since the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second or fourth house. 

From clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement: 
- First house: person wearing running shoes
- Second house: person eating grilled cheese
- Third house: tea drinker
- Fourth house: person wearing high heels and person who only drinks water

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. The answer is (C) 1."

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. 

From clue 2, we know the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the romance book lover must live in the second house, and the history book buff must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

However, we already know the history book buff lives in the third house. So, the person who ate fried rice must be the history book buff. This means the person who likes green must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow (romance book lover)
- House 2: Person who likes green (history book buff)
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice (science fiction book fanatic)

The correct answer is (B) 2."

4. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet.
5. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television.

From clue 5, we know the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television. This means the person with a television can't be in house 1 (because the person with a radio lives to the right of them). 

From clue 1, the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television. This means the person with a television can't be in house 1 either.

From clue 2, the golfer doesn't live in the second house. This means the golfer can live in either house 1 or 3.

From clue 3, the person with a computer and the person with a vase of tulips live next to each other. This means they can't be in the same house as the person with a radio (clue 4) or the person with a television (clue 5).

Now, let's try to fit the people in the houses:

- If the golfer lives in house 1, the person with a computer and a vase of tulips must live in house 2. But then the person with a radio can't live in house 2 (clue 4), so the golfer can't live in house 1.

- If the golfer lives in house 3, the person with a computer and a vase of tulips must live in house 1. The person with a radio can live in house 2, and the person with a television can live in house 3.

So, the person with a computer lives in house 1."

This means the person with lilies must be in the fifth house, and the person with high heels must be in the fourth house.

From clue 11, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house. This is consistent with our previous conclusion.

From clue 12, we know there are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives. Since the person with sandals is in the second house, the cellist must be in the sixth house.

- House 1: Percussionist (loafers)
- House 2: Basketball player (sandals)
- House 3: Swimmer (running shoes)
- House 4: Guitarist (high heels)
- House 5: Violinist (carnations arrangement)

2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
   Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2, the person who ate grilled cheese also lives in house 2.

Now, let's look at the remaining clues:
- One person is a dog owner and one is a fish enthusiast.
- One person ate stew and one ate grilled cheese.
- One person is wearing high heels and one is wearing sandals.

Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 and the person who ate grilled cheese also lives in house 2, the dog owner must live in house 1. The person wearing high heels lives in house 1, and the person wearing sandals must live in house 2.

So, the person who had stew lives in house 1."

However, we already know the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be the person who is wearing boots.

From clue 1, we know the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the third or fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the history book buff must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the second house. However, we already know the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must be the person who is wearing boots.

From clue 10 is not given, but we can deduce the following:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third or fourth house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing high heels lives in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives in the third house.
- The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
- The person who owns an SUV lives in the second house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.

Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who owns an SUV lives in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The romance book lover lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

From clue 6, the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist lives in the fourth house, the violinist must live in the fifth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house and the romance book lover lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the second house, and the guitarist must live in the fifth house.

From clue 1, the romance book lover lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover lives in the third house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the fourth house, but we already know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the fifth house, but we know the guitarist lives in the fifth house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house, and the romance book lover lives in the third house.

So, the correct order is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 4: Mystery book reader
- House 5: Guitarist

The violinist lives in the third house."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing loafers lives in the second house. From clue 4, the person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing loafers, so the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the person with the television lives in the fourth house. From clue 5, the person with the radio lives two houses to the left of the person with the sandals. Since the person with the television lives in the fourth house, the person with the radio lives in the second house (because there are two houses between the person with the radio and the person with the sandals). 

So, the order is:
- First house: boots
- Second house: radio
- Third house: phone
- Fourth house: television

Now, we need to find the person who has the gameboy. We know the person with the phone lives in the third house. Therefore, the person with the gameboy lives in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes milk does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the coffee drinker does not live in the first house.

So, the person who likes milk must live in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Milk drinker
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Running shoes

The coffee drinker can't live in the first or second house, so they must live in the third house.

So, the correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing loafers lives in either house 2 or house 3 (since there are only 2 houses). 

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in either house 1 or house 2.

Since the person wearing loafers cannot live in the first house, and the mystery book reader cannot live in the second house, the only possible combination is:

- The person wearing loafers lives in house 2.
- The mystery book reader lives in house 1.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in house 2."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. There is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 3, we know that the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic are separated by one house. Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the sequence so far is: 
1. History book buff
2. Golfer
3. ? (empty)

Since the golfer lives in the second house, the empty space must be the third house. Now, the sequence is: 
1. History book buff
2. Golfer
3. ?

From clue 3, we know that the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic are separated by one house. Since the golfer lives in the second house, the swimmer must live in the third house. The sequence is now:

- The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.

Since the percussionist lives in the second house, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the violinist must live in the first house.

Now, we know the person who has a radio lives in house 2. Since the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio, the percussionist lives in house 1.

So, the person who has a phone lives in house 1. 

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3.

Now, let's look at clue 2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or 2.

However, we already know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2. So, the person who likes white must live in house 1.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person who likes white
- House 2: person who drives a convertible
- House 3: person who owns a sedan

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

Wait, this is a contradiction! We already know the person who likes white lives in house 1. 

Let's re-examine the clues. From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, the person who likes yellow must live in house 2.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person who likes white
- House 2: person who likes yellow
- House 3: person who drives a convertible

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."

From clue 1, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the cat lover. So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the fourth house.

From clue 11, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. From clue 10, the bird keeper lives in the first house. So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house.

From clue 15, the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. From clue 1, the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house. So, the person who drives a truck lives in the third house.

The correct order of the people in the houses is:

1. Bird keeper (convertible)

4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. From clue 4, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 2, we know the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

So, the order is:

- Fantasy book enthusiast: House 2 (who ate fried rice)
- Spaghetti eater: House 1 (who ate spaghetti)

The person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house. 

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's think about the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

This means that the person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 1, because house 1 is to the left of house 2.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   This means the person who is wearing high heels cannot be in house 1, because the person who only drinks water lives directly left of them.

2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1, because the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of them.

3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   This means the person who is eating kiwis is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.

From clue 1, we know the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who likes yellow is in house 1, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 2.

So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know that the person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live next to each other. Since they live in houses 1 and 2, and the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person eating grapes, the order is: 

House 1: person wearing sandals, person eating grapes
House 2: person wearing high heels

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. This means the person wearing high heels lives in house 1.

From clue 3, we know the tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a television. Since the person wearing high heels lives in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be the tea drinker. 

So, the order is: 
House 1: tea drinker (wearing high heels), person eating grapes
House 2: person wearing sandals, person eating kiwis

Therefore, the person eating kiwis lives in house 2. The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   This means the water drinker can be in house 2 or 3.

2. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   This means the guitarist can be in house 1 or 3, and the violinist can be in house 2.

3. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   This means the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The tea drinker lives in house 1.
- The violinist can be in house 1 or 2.
- The water drinker lives to the right of the cellist, and the guitarist lives to the right of the violinist.
- The guitarist can be in house 1 or 3.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house. From clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives in the second house (since the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water).

From clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person wearing sandals is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must be in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who likes milk lives in the third house, which is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the person who likes milk must be in the first house.

From clue 2, the person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. This means the person wearing running shoes must live in the second, third, or fourth house. However, the person who only drinks water is in the second house, so the person wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the fourth house, the coffee drinker must be in the second house, but we already know the person who only drinks water is in the second house. This means the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

From clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Person wearing sandals (likes milk)
- House 4: Person wearing running shoes
- House 5: Tea drinker

The only remaining person is the person wearing high heels and loafers. Since the person wearing loafers must be in the fifth house (because there is one house between the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers), the person wearing high heels must be in the fourth house.

So, the correct answer is (C) 2."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 6, we know the person with a radio does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

From clue 8, we know the person with a computer does not live in the fourth house.

Now, let's try to place the people and their devices:

- Since the person with a television lives to the left of the person with a phone (clue 2), the person with a television must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person with a radio does not live in the fourth house (clue 6), and there is one house between the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a radio (clue 3). This means the person with a radio must be in house 3 or 4. Since the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house (clue 7), the person with a radio must be in house 3.
- The person with a computer does not live in the fourth house (clue 8), so the person with a computer must be in house 1 or 2. Since the person with a television lives to the left of the person with a phone (clue 2), the person with a computer must be in house 1.
- The person with a gameboy and the person with a computer live next to each other (clue 1). Since the person with a computer is in house 1, the person with a gameboy must be in house 2.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 5). Since the person with a gameboy is in house 2, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.
- The person who ate fried rice lives one house to the right of the person who has a gameboy (clue 4). Since the person with a gameboy is in house 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4.

- House 3: person with a grilled cheese, person with a radio
- House 4: person with a pizza, person with fried rice
- House 5: person with a phone, person with a phone

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives directly to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 5), the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3. However, we know that the person with a radio lives in house 3 (clue 3). This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3, but the person with a radio is in house 3. This is a contradiction.

However, re-examining the information, we can see that the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4, not house 3. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 5), and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 3. The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."

Now, we know the order of houses is: 
- Cat lover (1)

From clue 5, we know the person with tulips lives in the second house. From clue 6, we know the person wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the first house, the person wearing boots must be in the second house. The person who likes green must be in the third house, but we know the tea drinker lives in the third house. So, the person who likes green must be the tea drinker.

From clue 2, we know the person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes green is the tea drinker, the person eating kiwis must be in the second house. The person who likes blue must be in the third house.

Since the person eating kiwis is in the second house, the person eating apples must be in the first house. The person who likes milk must be in the third house, but we know the tea drinker lives in the third house. So, the person who likes milk must be the tea drinker.

Now we have the following arrangement:
