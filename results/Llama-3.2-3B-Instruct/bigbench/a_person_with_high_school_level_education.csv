"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1, we know the flutist lives in house 2. 

From clue 2, the person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the flutist lives in house 2, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 1.

From clue 3, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 1, the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 3.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. Since the flutist lives in house 2, the pianist must live in house 4.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: person with the vase of tulips
- House 2: flutist
- House 3: person with the bouquet of lilies
- House 4: pianist

From clue 2, the person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 1, the guitarist must live in house 3.

- House 1: person with the vase of tulips
- House 2: flutist
- House 3: guitarist
- House 4: pianist

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the order of the people is: 
- Green (G) 
- Gameboy (GB)
- Computer (C)

From clue 2, we know the order of the people is: 
- Green (G) 
- Gameboy (GB)
- Computer (C)

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow (Y) cannot live in the second house. Since the person who likes yellow (Y) cannot live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow (Y) must be in the first or third house, we can conclude that the person who likes yellow (Y) must live in the first house.

Now, let's try to fit the people into the houses:
- Yellow (Y) - 1st house
- Green (G) - 2nd house
- Gameboy (GB) - 3rd house
- Computer (C) - 2nd house

However, this arrangement contradicts clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the correct arrangement is:
- Yellow (Y) - 1st house
- Gameboy (GB) - 2nd house
- Computer (C) - 3rd house

So, the person who has a computer lives in house 3."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given clues to narrow down the possibilities.

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes white lives in either house 2 or 3, and the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. 

From clue 2, we know that the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. 

From clue 3, we know that the history book buff does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know that the root beer lover lives in the third house.

From clue 6, we know that the mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know that the person who likes red lives in the third house.

From clue 8, we know that the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.

From clue 9, we know that the tea drinker does not live in the second house.

- The person who likes red and the root beer lover live in the same house (clue 7 and clue 5).
- The person who likes white lives in either house 2 or 3 (clue 1).

- The history book buff does not live in the fourth house (clue 3).
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff (clue 8).
- The tea drinker does not live in the second house (clue 9).

Since the person who likes red and the root beer lover live in the same house, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the root beer lover must also live in the third house. 

Now, let's look at the possible positions for the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in either house 2 or 3, and the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green, the person who likes white must live in house 2.

The person who likes green must live in house 1, because the person who likes white lives in house 2, and the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green.

The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff (clue 8). Since the history book buff does not live in the fourth house (clue 3), the history book buff must live in either house 1 or 2. 

Since the person who likes white lives in house 2, the history book buff must live in house 1.

The tea drinker does not live in the second house (clue 9), so the tea drinker must live in either house 3 or 4.

The coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green (clue 2), and the person who likes green lives in house 1. Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either house 3 or 4.

Since the root beer lover lives in the third house (clue 5), the coffee drinker cannot live in house 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."

- The cat lover lives in the first house.
- The dog owner lives in the third house.
- The person who owns horses lives in the second house.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

Now, we can find the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house, and the person who owns horses lives in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the first or fourth house. However, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, so the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the first house.

The person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the fourth house, as there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.

Now, we can conclude that the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house, the dog owner lives in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house, and the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house. This means the fish enthusiast lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the person with the phone lives in house 1. 

From clue 2, we know the person wearing boots cannot live in house 2. 

From clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the person with the phone lives in house 1, the person who owns horses and has a radio must live in house 1 as well. 

Now, we have the following information:
- House 1: 
  - Person with phone
  - Person with horses
  - Person with radio

Since the person wearing boots cannot live in house 2, and the person with horses and radio live in house 1, the person wearing boots must live in house 2.

Now, we have the following information:
- House 1: 
  - Person with phone
  - Person with horses
  - Person with radio
- House 2: 
  - Person with boots

The only remaining characteristic is the device: one has a radio and one has a phone. Since the person with the phone lives in house 1, the person with the radio must live in house 2.

Now, we have the following information:
- House 1: 
  - Person with phone
  - Person with horses
- House 2: 
  - Person with boots
  - Person with radio

The only remaining characteristic is the shoe type: one is wearing boots and one is wearing high heels. Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person wearing high heels must live in house 1.

From clue 9, we know that the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house (clue 6), they must be in houses 1 and 2.

Now, let's summarize the information we have so far:

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. The pianist does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
3. The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.
4. The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
6. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.
7. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 5, we know the kiwis eater lives to the left of the boots eater. From clue 6, the radio eater lives to the left of the high heels eater. Combining these, we get: 
kiwis eater -> radio eater -> high heels eater

From clue 3, the pianist lives next to the high heels eater. Since the high heels eater is in the middle, the pianist must be in the house to the right of the high heels eater.

From clue 7, the oranges eater lives directly left of the television eater. Since the pianist is in the house to the right of the high heels eater, the oranges eater must be in the house to the left of the pianist. 

Now we have the order: 
kiwis eater -> radio eater -> high heels eater -> pianist -> oranges eater

From clue 4, the percussionist lives next to the running shoes eater. Since the running shoes eater can't be in the first house (because the pianist is in the second house), the running shoes eater must be in the third house. The percussionist must be in the second house.

Now we have the order: 
kiwis eater -> radio eater -> percussionist -> running shoes eater -> pianist -> oranges eater

The kiwis eater must be in the first house, the radio eater in the second house, the percussionist in the third house, the running shoes eater in the fourth house, and the pianist in the fifth house. The oranges eater must be in the sixth house. 

The television eater must be in the sixth house. 

The answer is (C) 2"

From clue 2, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes red does not live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes milk and the person eating a banana live directly next to each other.

From clue 5, we know the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

From clue 6, we know there are two houses between the root beer lover and the person eating kiwis.

From clue 12, we know the person eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.

From clue 13, we know the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Now, let's start filling in the information:

- The person who likes milk lives in the third house (clue 7).
- The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other (clue 13).
- Since the person who likes milk lives in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must live in either the second or fourth house.
- The person who owns a sedan cannot live in the fourth house because the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who owns a sedan (clue 13), and the person who likes yellow cannot live in the fourth house because the person who owns an SUV lives to the right of the person who likes milk (clue 8).
- Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in the second house.

Since the person wearing boots lives in the second house, the person wearing sandals must live in the first house. However, this contradicts clue 1, which states the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. Therefore, we must re-evaluate the information.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. From clue 5, the person wearing boots lives next to the person wearing running shoes. Since the person wearing boots can't live in the first house (because the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house), the person wearing boots must live in the second house.

From clue 4, the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person wearing boots lives in the second house, the person wearing sandals must live in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, the person who drives a minivan must live in the fourth house.

From clue 6, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. However, we already know the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house from clue 6. This means the person who drives a minivan must be the person who owns an SUV.

From clue 2, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the first or the fifth house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, the person wearing running shoes must live in the first house.

From clue 5, the person wearing boots lives next to the person wearing running shoes. Since the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house, the person wearing boots must live in the second house.

From clue 4, the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing high heels must live in the fifth house.

From clue 5, the person wearing boots lives next to the person wearing running shoes. Since the person wearing boots lives in the second house, the person wearing running shoes must live in the first house.

From clue 8, we know the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. 

From clue 3, we know the swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. 

From clue 4, we know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. 

Combining clues 3, 4, and 8, we can conclude that the swimmer lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement, and the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. 

From clue 7, we know the swimmer does not live in the first house. 

From clue 9, we know the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 1, we know there is one house between the coffee drinker and the tennis player. 

From clue 6, we know the tennis player lives to the left of the tea"
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating apples lives to the left of the minivan. Since the minivan is the third house, the person eating apples must live in the first or second house.

From clue 5, we know the person eating oranges does not live in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must live in the first or third house. However, since the tea drinker lives in the first house, the person eating oranges must live in the third house.

Now, let's analyze the possible positions of the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. From clue 4, there is one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker must live in the second house.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic (since the person eating oranges lives in the third house, and the person eating apples lives to the left of the minivan, which is in the third house)

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in the second house. 

From clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. This means the person who likes white must live in the first house.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: White (likes white)
- House 2: Red (likes red)
- House 3: Mystery (likes mystery)

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes white, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house.

However, we already know the person who likes red lives in the second house, and the person who likes mystery lives in the third house. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

So, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 5, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.

From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. So, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the dog owner must live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house, the bird keeper must live in the second house.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the bird keeper lives in the second house, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the third house, but we already know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house. This means the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second house, but that is taken by the bird keeper. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second house, but the bird keeper lives in the second house. This means the person who has a carnations arrangement must be the bird keeper. But we know the bird keeper lives in the second house, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be the bird keeper. This is a contradiction.

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 7, we know the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house. 

From clue 1, the person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker cannot live in the second house (clue 3), the person who has a television must live in the first house.

From clue 4, the person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who has a television lives in the first house, the guitarist must live in the second house.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. Since the guitarist lives in the second house, the flutist must live in the first house, and the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house.

From clue 2, the person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the coffee drinker must live in the second house. However, this contradicts the information from clue 7, where the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house. 

This means our initial assumption about the person who has a rose bouquet living in the second house is incorrect. The person who has a rose bouquet must live in the first house. 

So, the correct order is:
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house.
- The person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker lives in the third house.
- The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker, so the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

This means the person who has a vase of tulips is actually the tea drinker, which is incorrect. The person who has a vase of tulips must live in the third house, but this is the house of the person who is eating a banana. This means the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first house, which is the house of the person who has a rose bouquet. This is incorrect.

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 7, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.

From clue 1, the history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the history book buff lives in the second house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.

From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating apples must live in the third house, but we already know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house. This means the person who is eating apples must be the history book buff, which contradicts clue 1. However, we can re-evaluate clue 1. The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, but it doesn't say the history book buff can't live in the third house. So, the history book buff lives in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who is eating apples does not live in the third house, and the person who is eating apples lives in the third house. This means the person who is eating apples must be the history book buff, which we already concluded. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house, and there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. This means the person who is wearing boots lives in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.
3. The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From clue 3, we know the flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in house 1 (because the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house), the flutist must live in house 1.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the flutist lives in house 1, the person who is wearing loafers must live in house 1.

Now, let's look at clue 2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house. This means the person who owns an SUV lives in house 1.

From clue 1, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house. This means the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

Now, let's look at the remaining clues. The person who is wearing sandals must live in house 2, because the person who owns an SUV lives in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 2."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other. This means they can be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 3, we know the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house. This eliminates the possibility of the water drinker living in house 1.

From clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the water drinker and the root beer lover cannot live in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. This means the sedan owner and daffodil person cannot live in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. This means the cellist and saxophonist cannot live in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. This means the carnations person cannot live in houses 1 or 3.

From clue 8, we know the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the sedan owner and apple eater cannot live in the third house.

From clue 9, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. This means the apple eater and violinist cannot live in the third house.

Now, let's try to place the people in the houses:

- The root beer lover lives in the third house (clue 4).
- The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (clue 5).
- The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples (clue 8).
- The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist (clue 9).

This means the sedan owner, daffodil person, and apple eater must live in houses 1, 2, and 3, in that order.

Now, let's try to place the remaining people:

- The person who owns a sedan lives in house 1 (clue 5).
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2 (clue 5).
- The person who is eating apples lives in house 3 (clue 8).
- The person who is eating mangos lives in house 1 (we can deduce this from the fact that the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos, and the sedan owner lives in house 1).
- The person who is eating bananas lives in house 2 (we can deduce this from the fact that the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos, and the daffodil person lives in house 2).
- The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 3 (clue 7).
- The person who is eating mangos lives in house 1 (clue 8).
- The person who owns a minivan lives in house 2 (we can deduce this from the fact that the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other, and the water drinker cannot live in the first house).
- The person who only drinks water lives in house 3 (clue 1).
- The person who is eating bananas lives in house 2 (clue 6).
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1 (we can deduce this from the fact that the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the sedan owner lives in house 1).

Now, let's summarize the information:

- House 1: person who owns a sedan, person who has a bouquet of lilies, person who is eating mangos
- House 2: person who owns a minivan, person who is eating bananas, person who has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: person who only drinks water, person who has a carnations arrangement, person who is eating apples

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person with lilies can't live in house 1. Since the person with a television lives in house 1, the person with lilies must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at the devices: one person has a computer and one has a television. Since the person with a television lives in house 1, the person with a computer must live in house 2.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 1, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer. Since the person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other, and they must be to the left of the golfer, the order is: science fiction book fanatic, history book buff, and pizza eater.

From clue 3, we know the guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the person with daffodils must be to the left of the golfer, the order is: science fiction book fanatic, history book buff, pizza eater, daffodils, golfer, and guitarist.

- House 1: science fiction book fanatic (has tulips, eats spaghetti, plays baseball, and is a percussionist)
- House 2: history book buff (has daffodils, eats pizza, plays golf, and is a guitarist)

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 8, we know the violinist lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 9, we know there are two houses between the person who has a phone and the person who owns horses. Since the violinist lives in the fourth house, the person who owns horses must live in either the third or the fifth house. 

From clue 3, we know the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. If the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house, then the fish enthusiast would live in the sixth house, but the bird keeper lives in the fifth house, so this is not possible. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist. From clue 6, we know the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the guitarist must live in the fourth house, and the percussionist must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television. From clue 5, we know the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the percussionist lives in the second house, the flutist must live in the first house, and the person who has a television must live in the third house, but we already know the person who owns horses lives in the third house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the person who has a television must live in the second house, and the flutist must live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the dog owner does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist lives in the second house, the dog owner must live in the first house, and the person who has a gameboy must live in the fifth house.

From clue 7, we know the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a television lives in the second house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the fifth house, but we already know the bird keeper lives in the fifth house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the person who has a gameboy must live in the fourth house, and the person who has a television must live in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Dog owner, flutist
- House 2: Percussionist, person who has a television
- House 3: Person who owns horses, guitarist
- House 4: Person who has a gameboy, violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper, person who has a radio

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person eating apples lives in house 1, and the person with the radio lives in house 2.

"To solve this problem, we can use the given clues to deduce the order of the people and their houses.

From clue 1, we know the tennis player lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

From clue 3, we know the golfer lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the cricketer must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew lives in the fifth house. However, this contradicts clue 2, which states the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. This means our initial assumption about the person who ate fried rice in the second house is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the information. Since the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew must live in the fifth house. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house, which is the golfer's house. This contradicts clue 3, so our initial assumption about the golfer's house is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the information again. Since the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew must live in the fifth house. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house. Since the golfer lives in the fourth house, the golfer must be the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who had stew lives in the fifth house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house.

Now, let's re-evaluate the information again. Since the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew must live in the fifth house. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house. Since the golfer lives in the fourth house, the golfer must be the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who had stew lives in the fifth house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house.

From clue 7, we know the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the soccer player must live in the fourth house. However, we already know the golfer lives in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be the golfer. This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption about the golfer's house is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the information again. Since the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew must live in the fifth house. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house. Since the golfer lives in the fourth house, the golfer must be the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who had stew lives in the fifth house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the cricketer must live in the first house.

2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know that the person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2), the person who likes white must live in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 2.

Now, let's analyze the possible positions of the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti. Since they live directly next to each other (clue 3), and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.

We know that the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house (clue 1). Since the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 2.

Now, let's analyze the possible positions of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives directly next to the person who ate spaghetti (clue 4), and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: person who likes white, person who only drinks water, baseball player
- House 2: person who ate spaghetti, person who is wearing running shoes

Since the person who is wearing loafers is not in house 1, the person who is wearing loafers must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at the possible positions for the root beer lover and the person eating oranges. Since the person eating oranges cannot live in the second house, and the person eating mangos lives in the third house, the person eating oranges must live in the first house. 

The root beer lover cannot live in the second house, and the person eating oranges lives in the first house. This means the root beer lover must live in the third house.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 3."

The person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house, which is house 3.

From clue 3, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. Since the baseball player also lives in the second house (clue 2), the person who drives a convertible must be the baseball player.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house. Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person who eats grapes must live in the first house.

The only person left is the cricketer, who must live in the first house. Since the cricketer lives in the first house, the person who eats mangos must live in the second house.

Therefore, the person who eats mangos lives in house 2."

From clue 2, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. 

From clue 3, we know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples must live in the second house. However, we already know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must be the person who likes blue.

Now, we know the person who is eating apples lives in the second house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in the first house. 

So, the order of the houses is: 
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating apples (who likes blue) lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."

From clue 2, there are two houses between the truck owner and the dog owner. This means the order is: truck, sedan, fish enthusiast, dog owner, ?, ?, ?. Since there are only 4 houses, the last two houses must be the cat lover and the minivan.

From clue 5, the cat lover does not live in the second house. This means the cat lover must live in either the third or the fourth house. Since the fish enthusiast lives in the third house, the cat lover must live in the fourth house.

Now we have the order: truck, sedan, fish enthusiast, cat lover, ?, ?, minivan.

From clue 1, the minivan lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. So, the order is: truck, sedan, fish enthusiast, cat lover, minivan.

- The person who likes milk lives in the fourth house.
- The root beer lover lives in the second house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water.

So, the person who likes white must live in the second house. 

Now, from clue 1, we know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house. However, we already know the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house. 

This means our initial assumption about the person who likes blue must be incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the clues.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

However, we know the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house. This means the person who likes blue must be in the third house.

So, the correct order is:

- The person who likes blue lives in the third house.
- The root beer lover lives in the second house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the fourth house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the cricketer lives to the right of the person who is eating oranges. Since the basketball player lives in the first house, the cricketer must live in the second house. However, we already know the dog owner lives in the second house. This means the dog owner must be the person who is eating oranges.

From clue 7, we know the person who is wearing loafers lives to the right of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the basketball player, the person who is eating grapes must live in the third house. However, we already know the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house. This means the person who is eating grapes must be the person who is wearing loafers.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: cat lover, basketball player, eating oranges
- House 2: dog owner, eating grapes, wearing loafers
- House 3: bird keeper, wearing sandals

The only person left is the person who likes green, who must live in the first house. However, we already know the cat lover lives in the first house. This means the person who likes green must be the bird keeper.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live directly next to each other.
   - This means they can be in either house 1 and 2, but we don't know which one yet.

2. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who has a radio must be in house 1, because if they were in house 2, the person who had pizza would be to the left of the person who has a radio, which contradicts the previous clue.

3. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the saxophonist does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house, the saxophonist must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. 

From clue 2, we know the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the romance book lover must live in the second house, and the history book buff must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

However, we already know the history book buff lives in the third house. This means the person who ate fried rice must be the history book buff, which contradicts clue 3. 

Let's re-evaluate the clues. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the romance book lover lives in the second house, and the history book buff lives in the third house, we can conclude that the person who ate pizza must live in the first house. 

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the person who likes green must live in the second house. 

So, the order of the houses is:
- The person who likes yellow lives in house 1.
- The person who likes green lives in house 2.
- The person who likes blue lives in house 3.
- The person who ate pizza lives in house 1.
- The person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person with a computer and the person with a vase of tulips live next to each other.
4. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet.
5. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television.

From clue 3, we know the person with a computer and a vase of tulips live next to each other. Since they can't be in the second house (because the golfer doesn't live there), they must be in either the first or the third house.

From clue 1, the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television. This means the person with a computer and a vase of tulips can't be in the third house because the tennis player would then be in the third house, and the person with a television would be in the first house, which contradicts clue 5.

So, the person with a computer and a vase of tulips must be in the first house.

From clue 5, the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television. Since the person with a computer and a vase of tulips is in the first house, the person with a radio must be in the third house.

From clue 4, the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. This means the person with a rose bouquet must be in the second house.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person with a computer and a vase of tulips
- House 2: Person with a rose bouquet
- House 3: Person with a radio

The only person left is the golfer, who must be in the third house, but we already have the radio in the third house. This means the golfer must be in the second house, which contradicts clue 2. However, we can swap the positions of the person with a radio and the golfer, so the golfer can be in the second house and the person with a radio in the third house.

The correct arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with a computer and a vase of tulips
- House 2: Golfer
- House 3: Person with a radio

The person with a rose bouquet must be in the first house, which is not possible. However, we can swap the positions of the person with a computer and the person with a rose bouquet, so the person with a rose bouquet is in the first house and the person with a computer is in the second house.

The correct arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with a rose bouquet
- House 2: Person with a computer
- House 3: Person with a radio

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

From clue 3, we know that the swimmer cannot live in the first house (since the history book buff lives there) or the third house (since there needs to be one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic). This means the swimmer must live in the second house.

However, we already know the golfer lives in the second house. Therefore, the swimmer cannot live in the second house. 

Considering the above, the only possible position for the swimmer is the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and narrow down the possibilities.

From clue 1, we know the swimmer lives directly left of the person eating apples. Since the swimmer can't be in the fourth house (clue 4), the swimmer must be in either the first or second house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer. If the swimmer is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the second house. If the swimmer is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the bird keeper lives in the third house (clue 8), the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house (if the swimmer is in the first house) or the first house (if the swimmer is in the second house).

From clue 5, the cat lover lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the cat lover can't be in the fourth house (clue 4), the cat lover must be in either the first or second house.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the cat lover can't be in the fourth house (clue 4), the cat lover must be in either the first or second house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player. Since the cat lover can't be in the fourth house (clue 4), the cat lover must be in either the first or second house.

From clue 10, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast can't be in the fourth house (clue 4), the fantasy book enthusiast must be in either the first or second house.

From clue 11, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player. Since the fantasy book enthusiast can't be in the fourth house (clue 4), the fantasy book enthusiast must be in either the first or second house.

Now, let's combine all the information:

- If the swimmer is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house (clue 3). The cat lover must be in the second house (clue 5). The person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house (clue 6). The person who had pizza must be in the fourth house (clue 11). The person who is eating a banana must be in the second house (clue 7). The person who is eating grapes must be in the first house (clue 10). The person who ate spaghetti is the cat lover, but the cat lover is in the third house, so this is a contradiction.

- If the swimmer is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house (clue 3). The cat lover must be in the second house (clue 5). The person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house (clue 6). The person who had pizza must be in the fourth house (clue 11). The person who is eating a banana must be in the first house (clue 7). The person who is eating grapes must be in the third house (clue 10). The person who ate spaghetti is the cat lover, but the cat lover is in the third house, so this is a contradiction.

However, if we re-examine the information, we can find a possible solution:

- The swimmer is in the first house (clue 1).
- The fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house (clue 3).
- The cat lover is in the third house (clue 5).
- The person who ate spaghetti is in the third house (clue 6).
- The person who had pizza is in the fourth house (clue 11).
- The person who is eating a banana is in the second house (clue 7).
- The person who is eating grapes is in the first house (clue 10).

Now, let's analyze the remaining information:

- The person who ate fried rice is not in the fourth house (clue 4). The person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, so the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house. The person who is eating oranges must be in the first house (clue 1). The person who is eating apples must be in the second house (clue 1). The person who is eating bananas must be in the second house (clue 7). The person who is eating grapes must be in the first house (clue 10). The person who is eating stew must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 4."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   This means the order of the houses is: 
   - House 1 (sandals) - House 2 (horses)

2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, the history book buff must live in House 1.

Now, let's combine the information:
- House 1: history book buff (wearing sandals)
- House 2: person who ate spaghetti (owning horses)

Since the person who ate fried rice is not mentioned in the clues, we can conclude that the person who ate fried rice lives in House 1, as House 1 is already occupied by the history book buff.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The flutist does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know that the person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the flutist does not live in the first house. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2, the flutist must live in house 1.

Now, let's look at the remaining options:
- The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, which is house 2. So, the person who owns a sedan must live in house 1.
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1, as the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 3, we know the person with carnations lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer lives in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the person with daffodils lives in the third house, the golfer lives in the fourth house, but this contradicts clue 3. So, the golfer must live in the third house.

From clue 6, the person with the rose bouquet lives in the third house, which is the golfer.

From clue 7, the tennis player does not live in the fourth house. Since the golfer lives in the third house, the tennis player must live in the first or second house.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the person with daffodils lives and where the person with the rose bouquet lives. Since the person with daffodils lives in the third house and the person with the rose bouquet lives in the third house, this clue is not possible. However, we can re-evaluate clue 8 considering the correct positions of the people.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the person with daffodils lives and where the person with the rose bouquet lives. Since the person with daffodils lives in the third house, the person with the rose bouquet must live in the fourth house, but this contradicts clue 3. So, the person with the rose bouquet must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book reader. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

From clue 9, there are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives. Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the romance book lover must live in the fourth house, but this contradicts clue 3. So, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

However, we have already determined that the golfer lives in the third house. Therefore, the romance book lover cannot live in the third house.

From clue 2, the tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the tennis player must live in the second house.

From clue 1, there is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the swimmer lives. Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the swimmer must live in the third house.

However, we have already determined that the golfer lives in the third house. Therefore, the swimmer cannot live in the third house.

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house, the swimmer must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the tennis player must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the person with carnations lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist lives in house 1, the person who likes yellow must live in house 2 or 3. However, we already know the coffee drinker lives in house 2, so the person who likes yellow must live in house 3.

From clue 13, we know the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 3, the person who likes milk must live in house 1 or 2.

From clue 8, we know the flutist lives in the second house. Since the person who likes milk lives in house 2, the flutist must live in house 2.

From clue 11, we know the person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.

The person who had stew must live in the fourth house, since the person who likes red lives in the second house and the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house. The person who had stew is the only one left, so the person who had stew lives in the fourth house.

The person who had grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white, so the person who had grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

- The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.

Since the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player, and the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player, the violinist must live in the fourth house. 

Now, the basketball player must live in the third house, and the tennis player must live in the second house. 

The only person left is the person who likes yellow, who must live in the first house.

So, the correct order is:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
- The tennis player lives in the second house.
- The basketball player lives in the third house.
- The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes red lives in the fifth house (there is no fifth house, so this is incorrect, but we can ignore this clue).

However, we can ignore the fifth house since it's not present. 

The correct order is:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
- The tennis player lives in the second house.
- The basketball player lives in the third house.

7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes white lives in the first house. From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house. 

From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. 

From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house. 

From clue 7, we know the person who had stew does not live in the second house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the third house.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person who likes white, eats spaghetti, wears boots
- House 2: Person who likes green, eats fried rice
- House 3: Person who likes red, eats stew

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house, so the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. However, we already know the person who likes white lives in the first house, so the person who is wearing high heels must be the person who likes red. 

The person who is wearing high heels lives in the first house, eats spaghetti, and likes red. The person who likes white lives in the first house, eats spaghetti, and wears boots. The person who likes green lives in the second house, eats fried rice, and wears running shoes.

The correct arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who likes red, eats spaghetti, wears high heels

- House 2: person with rose bouquet
- House 3: person with science fiction book fanatic

From clue 1, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 1.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house (clue 2), the fantasy book enthusiast must be the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who ate fried rice) lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

Now, we know the order of the houses is: 
- Fantasy book enthusiast (fried rice) - 2nd house
- Science fiction book fanatic - ? (we don't know yet)
- Spaghetti eater - 1st house

From clue 2, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (fried rice) lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house.

The order of the houses is now: 
- Science fiction book fanatic - 1st house
- Fantasy book enthusiast (fried rice) - 2nd house
- Spaghetti eater - 3rd house

The only person left is the grilled cheese eater. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house, the grilled cheese eater must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

From this clue, we can deduce that the person with the carnations arrangement must live in house 1, because if they lived in house 2, the dog owner would have to live in house 1, which contradicts the statement that the person with the carnations arrangement lives to the left of the dog owner.

So, the person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The person with the tulips arrangement must live in house 2, and the dog owner must live in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   This means the person who is wearing high heels cannot be in house 1, because the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. So, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 2.

2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   Since the person who is wearing high heels is in house 2, and the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.

3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   Since the person who is wearing high heels is in house 2, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house, this clue is consistent with the previous conclusion.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: person who likes yellow, eating grapes, wearing sandals
- House 2: person who is wearing high heels, eating kiwis

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know that the person wearing sandals and the person eating grapes live next to each other. Since they live in houses 1 and 2, and the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, the order is: 

- House 1: person wearing high heels, person eating grapes
- House 2: person wearing sandals, person eating kiwis

Now, let's analyze the remaining clues. Clue 3 states that the tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television. Since the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1. 

The person wearing high heels is eating grapes (from clue 2), so the person eating grapes is in house 1. The person wearing sandals is eating kiwis (from clue 2), so the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

Therefore, the person eating kiwis lives in house 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   This means the water drinker can be in house 2 or 3.

2. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   This means the guitarist can be in house 1 or 3, and the violinist can be in house 2.

3. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   This means the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. The violinist does not live in the third house.
   This means the violinist can be in house 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The tea drinker lives in house 1.
- The violinist can be in house 1 or 2.
- The water drinker lives to the right of the cellist, and the guitarist lives to the right of the violinist.
- The guitarist can be in house 1 or 3.

Considering all the above points, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 3."

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
2. The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
3. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
4. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
5. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
6. The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. Since there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives, and the person who likes grapes lives in the second house, the person who likes white must live in the first house, and the person who is eating a banana must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's analyze the remaining clues:

- Clue 1 states that the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.
- Clue 2 states that the person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in the second house, but we already know the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. This means the person who likes green must live in the third house, but that would mean the person who likes red lives in the fourth house, which is not possible since the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who likes green must live in the first house, and the person who likes red must live in the second house.
- Clue 4 states that the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's summarize the information we have so far:

- The person who likes white lives in the first house.

- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.

3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. Since they can't be in the same house (clue 1), they must be in houses 1 and 2, in that order. 

Now, let's analyze the possible positions of the cellist and the mystery book reader. From clue 1, the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. If the cellist lived in house 1, the mystery book reader would live in house 2. But then, the history book buff would have to live in house 1, which contradicts clue 2. Therefore, the cellist must live in house 2, and the mystery book reader lives in house 1.

Now, we know the order of the houses is:

- House 2: cellist
- House 1: history book buff

From clue 2, the history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. Since the history book buff lives in house 1, the cat lover must live in house 2.

If the dog owner lives in the first house, then the person with tulips would live in the third house, which is not possible because the person with carnations would have to live in the third house as well (from clue 1). 

So, the dog owner must live in the third house. 

Now, the person with tulips must live in the second house, and the person with carnations must live in the first house. 

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house number 2. 

The answer is (B) 2."

The famous Apollo's are likely referring to the characters from Greek mythology, such as Apollo, the god of the sun, music, poetry, and prophecy. They are known for their incredible abilities and powers.

In a hypothetical battle between the two groups, it's unlikely that the Apollo's would be able to defeat the D'Artagnan's. The D'Artagnan's are skilled warriors with swords and martial arts training, but they are not gods or demigods. They would likely be able to hold their own against the Apollo's, but the Apollo's would have the advantage of their divine powers and abilities."

The French Defense is a popular chess opening that can lead to a number of different pawn structures and transpositions. However, it is not typically considered to be a solid defense against a four-move checkmate.

In general, a four-move checkmate is extremely rare, and it usually requires a very specific and unusual sequence of moves. The French Defense is a solid and flexible opening that can be used to delay the center and create counterplay, but it is not designed to prevent checkmate.

In fact, the French Defense can sometimes lead to a position where White has a strong initiative and can launch a powerful attack, which can ultimately lead to checkmate. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) No."

Research has shown that individuals with anorexia nervosa are at a higher risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures due to several factors, including:

1. Malnutrition: Inadequate nutrition can lead to a lack of calcium and vitamin D, which are essential for bone health.
2. Hormonal changes: Anorexia nervosa can disrupt hormone levels, including a decrease in estrogen, which is important for bone density.
3. Low body weight: Being underweight can put additional stress on bones, making them more prone to fractures.
4. Reduced muscle mass: Muscle plays a crucial role in bone health, and individuals with anorexia nervosa often have low muscle mass.

As a result, people with anorexia nervosa are more likely to experience osteoporosis and bone fractures, including osteoporotic compression fractures, which can occur even with minimal trauma."

In the story ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" the main character, Alice, is a young girl who enters a fantastical world where she encounters strange creatures and experiences many surreal events.

"To determine if 500GB is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows, we need to know the average size of a Netflix show.

The average length of a Netflix show can vary greatly, but a typical episode is around 30-60 minutes long. Let's assume an average episode is 45 minutes long.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 10 hours would be 10 x 60 = 600 minutes.

Now, let's convert 600 minutes to hours: 600 minutes / 60 = 10 hours.

Since each episode is 45 minutes long, we can fit 10 hours of shows in 10 / 0.75 = 13.33 episodes.

Assuming an average episode size of 1 GB (this can vary greatly depending on the show and quality), we can fit 13.33 episodes in 13.33 GB.

Since 500 GB is less than 13.33 GB, the answer is:

To calculate this, let's assume the debt is $2.6 billion and we want to know how many years it would take to pay it off if we were to use Michael Bloomberg's wealth. 

$2,600,000,000 / $1,000,000,000 = 2.6 years

A city's population alone is not a direct indicator of its ability to support a military division. However, considering Ashland, Oregon's population is around 94,000, which is relatively small compared to other cities that have been designated as military bases or have significant military presence.

In the United States, a military division typically requires a larger population to support its operations, infrastructure, and personnel. A division usually requires a significant amount of resources, including housing, infrastructure, and local support services, which can be challenging to provide in a smaller city like Ashland.

Additionally, a military division typically requires a strategic location, access to transportation hubs, and a certain level of economic stability, which Ashland may not have compared to larger cities.

"To answer this question, we need to consider the height of each structure.

The Statue of Unity is 182 meters (597 feet) tall.

The Statue of Liberty is 93 meters (305 feet) tall.

The Lighthouse of Alexandria is estimated to be around 120-130 meters (394-430 feet) tall.

Since 182 meters is greater than 120-130 meters, the Statue of Unity is taller than the Lighthouse of Alexandria."

"I'm not aware of any information about the number of Imams Reza Shah. However, I can tell you that the Imams are the spiritual leaders of Shia Islam, and the number of Imams varies depending on the branch of Shia Islam.

In Shia Islam, there are 12 Imams, and the 12th Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, is considered to be in a state of occultation, meaning he is not visible to the public.

As for Jesus's disciples, it is estimated that he had around 12-15 disciples.

So, without knowing the exact number of Imams Reza Shah, I can say that it's unlikely that the number of Imams Reza Shah (if he was a historical figure) would exceed the number of Jesus's disciples."

"To answer this question, we need to know the approximate number of unemployed people in the United States during the Great Depression in 1933.

According to historical records, the unemployment rate in the United States in 1933 was around 24.9%. This translates to approximately 12.5 million people out of a population of around 123 million.

Tiger Stadium, which is a large stadium, has a seating capacity of around 100,000 people.

Now, let's do a rough calculation:

12,500,000 (unemployed people) / 100,000 (stadium capacity) ≈ 125

So, yes, all the unemployed people due to the 1933 Great Depression could fit in Tiger Stadium."

The Clerk of the Supreme Court of Canada is a high-stress profession that involves working in a large, formal building with many people, including judges, lawyers, and other court staff. The courtroom can be a potentially overwhelming environment for someone with seismophobia, which is an excessive or irrational fear of earthquakes. The Clerk's office is located in the heart of Ottawa, which is prone to earthquakes, and the building itself may not be designed to withstand significant seismic activity. Additionally, the Clerk's role requires frequent travel to different locations, including courthouses and other government buildings, which could expose the individual to potential earthquake risks."

Oscar Wilde was a famous Irish author and playwright who was tried and convicted of gross indecency in 1895 for his relationship with a man, which was considered a crime at that time in the UK. He was sentenced to two years of hard labor, which was a harsh punishment for the time.

In the US, laws regarding same-sex relationships have changed significantly since then. The US Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) struck down laws that prohibited consensual same-sex relationships, and many states have since repealed their laws against same-sex marriage.

Considering these changes, it's unlikely that Oscar Wilde's treatment under the law would be considered fair in the US today."
"I think the answer is (B) No.

The 2020 Jaguar F-Type is a sports car, and it's designed for performance and style, not for large families. It has a relatively small interior space, and it's not suitable for a family of four, especially the Obamas, who have two daughters, Malia and Sasha. They would likely need a larger vehicle to accommodate everyone comfortably."

The largest ship from Christopher Columbus' voyages was the Santa Maria, which was a nao (a three-masted sailing ship). However, it was much smaller than the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty is a massive copper statue that stands 305 feet (93 meters) tall, including the pedestal, and weighs around 225 tons.

The Santa Maria was about 62 feet (19 meters) long and 26 feet (8 meters) wide, and it was designed to carry a crew of around 40-50 people. It was not nearly large enough to transport the Statue of Liberty.

The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) was a devastating conflict in Europe that involved many countries, including Germany, where the white cockatoo is native. The war was marked by widespread destruction, famine, and disease, which would have made it difficult for any bird, including a white cockatoo, to survive.

Additionally, the war was fought in a time when many animals were hunted for food, and birds were likely seen as a source of protein. It's unlikely that a white cockatoo would have been spared from being hunted or captured.

So, while it's possible that a white cockatoo may have survived the war in some remote area, it's unlikely that it would have survived the entire conflict."

In Japan, serfdom was a system where peasants were tied to the land and were required to provide labor and goods to the lord in exchange for protection and housing. However, serfs in Japan were not considered to be of the same social status as the nobility or the samurai class. They were considered to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy.

In England, serfdom was also present, but it was not as rigidly structured as in Japan. English serfs were considered to be of lower social status than the nobility, but they were also considered to be part of the emerging middle class. They had more rights and freedoms than Japanese serfs, and they were able to move up the social ladder through hard work and education.

So, while both systems had their own unique characteristics, I would say that English serfdom was not necessarily of higher status than Japanese serfdom."
"I think I can answer that.

Andrew Johnson was the 17th President of the United States, and his presidential number is 17.

Elagabalus, on the other hand, was a Roman Emperor, and his number is not a fixed or widely recognized number like a presidential number. However, I can look up that Elagabalus was the 18th Roman Emperor.

So, Andrew Johnson's presidential number (17) is less than Elagabalus's Emperor number (18). 

The answer is (B) No."
"I would say (B) Yes. J.D. Salinger's most famous work, ""The Catcher in the Rye"", has been a classic coming-of-age story that has been widely read and referenced. Some people who have committed violent acts, such as school shooters, have cited the book as an influence on their thoughts and feelings. The book's themes of alienation, rebellion, and disillusionment with society may resonate with individuals who feel disconnected or disenfranchised. Additionally, the protagonist Holden Caulfield's struggles with mental health and his desire for connection and belonging may also be seen as a catalyst for some individuals to act out in violent ways."

The King of Portugal in 1515 was John III of Portugal, and he was a member of the House of Aviz, which was a branch of the House of Burgundy. The Tudors were a royal house of English origin, and they were closely related to the Portuguese royal family through the marriage of Catherine of Aragon, who was the daughter of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, to Arthur, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King Henry VII of England."
"I don't think so. Johnny Carson was a comedian and TV host, not a water polo player. I couldn't find any information about him being involved in water polo."
(B) Yes
(B) Yes
(B) No
"I would choose (A) No.

Sugar Ray Robinson was a professional boxer, and boxing is a sport that requires a high level of physical fitness, skill, and adherence to rules. Stealing, regardless of the location, would likely result in serious consequences, such as arrest and imprisonment, which would prevent him from participating in boxing."
"I think the answer is (A) No. 

A cheetah is the fastest land animal on Earth, but it's not nearly strong enough to topple someone as large as The Big Show, a professional wrestler. The Big Show is a giant of a man, standing over 7 feet tall and weighing over 500 pounds. A cheetah, even at full speed, can only generate a force of around 1,800 pounds per square inch (psi). The Big Show, on the other hand, would likely be able to withstand a much greater force without being toppled."

Martin Luther and Martin Luther King Jr. were two separate individuals. Martin Luther was a German theologian and reformer who lived in the 16th century and is credited with starting the Protestant Reformation.

King Arthur is a legendary figure from the Arthurian legends, and he is not associated with the historical event of Anne Boleyn's execution. Anne Boleyn was the second wife of King Henry VIII, and she was beheaded on May 19, 1536, on charges of adultery, incest, and treason. King Arthur, on the other hand, is said to have lived in the 5th or 6th century, long before Henry VIII's time."
"I would choose (B) No.

While it's not impossible for a paraplegic to conduct an orchestra, it would likely be extremely challenging, if not impossible, due to the physical demands of the job. Conducting an orchestra requires standing, moving around the podium, and using gestures to communicate with the musicians, which would be difficult or impossible for someone with paraplegia."
A: A
"I'd say (B) No.

Javier Sotomayor is a human who set the record for the fastest 400-meter dash in the world, with a time of 36.84 seconds. Bengal cats are a breed of domestic cat, and while they're known for their agility and speed, they're not exactly built for long-distance running.

Cats are not capable of running at the same speeds as humans, and even the fastest cat in the world would likely be nowhere near Sotomayor's record time. So, it's unlikely that a Bengal cat could beat Sotomayor's record."

The Battle of Actium was a decisive naval battle fought in 31 BC between the forces of Octavian (later known as Augustus Caesar) and Mark Antony. The Roman fleet was significantly outnumbered by the combined forces of Octavian and his allies, but they had the advantage of superior tactics and better-trained sailors.

If the modern Brazilian Navy were to hypothetically participate in the Battle of Actium, they would have a significant advantage in terms of technology, training, and equipment. Modern naval warfare is vastly different from ancient naval warfare, with advancements in ship design, propulsion, and weaponry.

Brazil's modern navy is one of the largest and most technologically advanced in the world, with a fleet of advanced warships, including aircraft carriers, submarines, and guided-missile destroyers. They would have a significant advantage in terms of firepower, speed, and maneuverability compared to the ancient Roman fleet.

Additionally, modern naval warfare places a strong emphasis on coordination and strategy, which would allow the Brazilian Navy to coordinate their efforts more effectively and exploit the weaknesses of the Roman fleet. They could also use advanced sensors, communication systems, and intelligence gathering capabilities to gather information about the Roman fleet and plan their attack more effectively.

Overall, I believe that the modern Brazilian Navy would have a significant advantage in a hypothetical battle against the Roman fleet at Actium, and could potentially turn the tide of the battle in their favor."
