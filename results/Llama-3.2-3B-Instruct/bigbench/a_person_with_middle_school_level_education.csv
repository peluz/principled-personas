"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1, we know the flutist lives in house 2. 

From clue 2, the person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the flutist lives in house 2, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 1.

From clue 3, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 1, the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 3.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. Since the flutist lives in house 2, the pianist must live in house 4.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: person with the vase of tulips

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the order of the people is: 
- Green (G) 
- Gameboy (GB)
- Computer (C)

From clue 2, we know the order of the people is: 
- Green (G) 
- Gameboy (GB)
- Computer (C)

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow (Y) cannot live in the second house. Since the person who likes yellow (Y) cannot live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow (Y) must be in the first or third house, we can conclude that the person who likes yellow (Y) must live in the first house.

Now, let's try to fit the people into the houses:
- Yellow (Y) lives in the first house.
- Green (G) lives in the second house.
- Gameboy (GB) lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who has a gameboy (GB) lives directly left of the person who has a computer (C). Since the person who has a gameboy (GB) lives in the third house, the person who has a computer (C) must live in the second house.

"To solve this problem, we can use the given clues to narrow down the possibilities.

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes white lives in either house 2 or 3, and the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. 

From clue 2, we know that the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. 

From clue 3, we know that the history book buff does not live in the fourth house. 

From clue 4, we know that the romance book lover does not live in the first house.

From clue 8, we know that the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.

From clue 9, we know that the tea drinker does not live in the second house.

Now, let's try to put the people in order from left to right:

- The person who likes red lives in the third house (clue 7).
- The root beer lover lives in the third house (clue 5), so the person who likes red and the root beer lover are the same person.
- The person who likes white lives in either house 2 or 3 (clue 1). Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes white must live in house 2.
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff (clue 8). Since the history book buff does not live in the fourth house (clue 3), the history book buff must live in house 4.

From clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, the fish enthusiast must live in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and the fish enthusiast lives in the second house, the person who has a computer must live in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the person who had pizza lives in the second house, the person who had pizza is not the cat lover.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and the person who has a computer lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house.

From clue 9, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and the person who has a computer lives in the third house, the person who had stew must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had stew lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the fifth house.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a computer lives in the third house, the person who owns horses must live in the first or second house. However, the person who has a computer lives in the third house, so the person who owns horses must live in the first house.

- kiwis eater, radio eater, pianist, high heels eater, TV eater
- kiwis eater, radio eater, percussionist, running shoes eater, high heels eater, TV eater

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating apples lives to the left of the minivan. Since the minivan is the third house, the person eating apples must live in the first or second house.

From clue 5, we know the person eating oranges does not live in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must live in the first or third house. However, since the tea drinker lives in the first house, the person eating oranges must live in the third house.

Now, let's analyze the possible positions for the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. From clue 4, there is one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker must live in the second house.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic (since the person eating oranges lives in the third house)

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   This means the order of the houses is: red, mystery, ? (we don't know the color of the third house yet)

2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   This means the fantasy book enthusiast can live in either the second or the third house.

3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   This means the person who likes white can live in either the first or the second house.

4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   This means the order of the houses is: ?, ?, red (we know the second house is red)

Now, let's combine the information:

- The person who likes white can live in the first house (since the third house is not an option).
- The person who likes yellow can live in the third house (since the first house is taken by the person who likes white).
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house (so it can't be the person who likes white or the person who likes red).
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house (since the second house is taken by the person who likes red).

So, the order of the houses is: white, ?, red, yellow. The person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, and the person who likes red lives in the second house. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 5, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. So, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the dog owner must live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating oranges lives in the fourth house, the bird keeper must live in the second house.

From clue 8, we know the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the third house, but we already know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second house.

From clue 9, we know the person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house, the history book buff must live in the third house, but we already know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house. This is another contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the person who drives a minivan and the history book buff must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, we know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house, the romance book lover must live in the third house, but we already know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house. This is another contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

From clue 11, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the third house, but we already know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house. This is another contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the person who is eating grapes must live in the fourth house.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person with lilies can't live in house 1. Since the person with a television lives in house 1, the person with lilies must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at the devices: one person has a computer and one has a television. Since the person with a television lives in house 1, the person with a computer must live in house 2.

So, the person with a computer lives in house 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
   - This means the order of the people from left to right is: 
     - Science fiction book fanatic
     - Golfer
     - ? (we don't know yet)

2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - Since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, the history book buff must be to the right of the golfer.
   - This means the order of the people from left to right is:
     - Science fiction book fanatic
     - Golfer
     - History book buff
     - ? (we don't know yet)

3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the history book buff has a bouquet of daffodils, the guitarist must be to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the order of the people from left to right is:
     - Science fiction book fanatic
     - Golfer
     - History book buff
     - Guitarist

Now, let's look at the remaining clues:

- Each person plays a different musical instrument: one is a guitarist and one is a percussionist.
- Each person has different flowers in their foyer: one has a vase of tulips and one has a bouquet of daffodils.

So, the percussionist lives in house 1."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 8, we know the violinist lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 9, we know there are two houses between the person who has a phone and the person who owns horses. Since the violinist lives in the fourth house, the person who owns horses must live in either the third or the fifth house. 

From clue 3, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. If the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house, then the fish enthusiast would live in the sixth house, but the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the guitarist (clue 1), and the guitarist lives to the right of the percussionist (clue 6). This would mean the percussionist lives in the first house, which is not possible since the violinist lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in the third house.

From clue 3, the fish enthusiast lives next to the person who owns horses, so the fish enthusiast lives in the fourth house. However, we already know the violinist lives in the fourth house. This means the fish enthusiast must live in the third house, and the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the flutist lives to the left of the person who has a television. From clue 5, the person who has a television lives to the left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 1, the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the guitarist. From clue 6, the guitarist lives to the right of the percussionist. This means the percussionist lives in the first house, the guitarist lives in the second house, and the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives to the left of the person who has a gameboy. This means the person who has a television lives in the second house, the guitarist lives in the third house, and the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the person who has a radio lives in the third house. 

From clue 10, the bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

So, the order of the houses is:

- Bird keeper: 5
- Fish enthusiast: 3
- Dog owner: 1

   - Since the person with the radio lives in house 2, the violinist must live in house 1.

3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - This confirms that the person with lilies lives in house 1.

4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Since the violinist lives in house 1, the basketball player must live in house 2.

From clue 1, we know the tennis player lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

From clue 3, we know the golfer lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the cricketer must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew lives in the fifth house. However, this contradicts clue 2, which states the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. This means our initial assumption about the person who ate fried rice in the second house is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the information. Since the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew must live in the fifth house. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

Now, we know the order of the houses is:
- Cricketer (1)
- Fried rice (2)
- Tennis player (3)
- Golfer (4)
- Stew (5)
- Grilled cheese (6)
- Pizza (7)

4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know that the person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2), the person who likes white must live in house 1. The person who only drinks water must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at clue 3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes white lives in house 1, the baseball player must live in house 2. The person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1.

So, we have:

- House 1: 
  - Person who likes white
  - Person who ate spaghetti
  - Baseball player

- House 2: 
  - Person who only drinks water
  - Person who likes red
  - Swimmer

From clue 1, we know that the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. Since the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 2.

Now, we know that the person who is wearing loafers must live in house 1, since the person who likes white lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."

4. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos cannot live in the first house (because the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos), the person eating mangos must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at the possible positions for the root beer lover and the person eating oranges. Since the person eating oranges cannot live in the second house, and the person eating mangos lives in the third house, the person eating oranges must live in the first house. 

The root beer lover cannot live in the second house, and the person eating oranges lives in the first house. This means the root beer lover must live in the third house.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 3."

- House 2: Boots
- House 3: ? (We still need to find out who lives in the third house)

From clue 1, we know the person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

Now we have the order of houses:

"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and narrow down the possibilities.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the person who likes blue lives in the last house (because the person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other, and the person who likes blue lives in the last house), the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the person who likes red lives in the last house (because the person who likes blue lives in the last house), the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who drives a truck does not live in the third house. Since the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the third house, the person who drives a truck lives in the first or second house.

From clue 6, we know the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red lives in the last house, the person who is eating mangos lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house, the person who drives a truck lives in the first house.

From clue 8, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person who drives a truck lives in the first house, the person who drives a minivan lives in the second house.

From clue 9, we know the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who is eating mangos lives in the second house, the person who had pizza lives in the third house.

From clue 10, we know the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who likes red lives in the last house, the person who is eating grapes lives in the last house.

From clue 11, we know the person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. Since the person who had pizza lives in the third house, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the fourth house.

From clue 12, we know the person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes blue lives in the last house, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

From clue 13, we know the person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the person who had pizza lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.
- The person who drives a truck lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating mangos lives in the second house.
- The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house.
- The person who had pizza lives in the third house.
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the fourth house.
- The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the last house.

The only remaining house is the last house, which is house 4. Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 3."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. Since the baseball player also lives in the second house (clue 2), the person who drives a convertible must be the baseball player.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house. Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the first house.

The only person left is the cricketer, who must live in the first house. Since the person who is eating grapes lives in the first house, the cricketer must be eating grapes.

The person who drives a minivan must live in the first house, as the baseball player drives a convertible. Therefore, the person who is eating mangos must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. 

From clue 3, we know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples must live in the second house. However, we already know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. This means the person who likes blue must be eating apples.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: ? (person who likes green)
- House 2: person who likes blue (eating apples)
- House 3: person who is eating kiwis

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who likes white must live in the third house. However, we already know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house. This means the person who likes white must be eating oranges.

Now we have the final arrangement:
- House 1: person who likes green (eating ?)
- House 2: person who likes blue (eating apples)
- House 3: person who likes white (eating oranges)

Since the person who likes green is left, they must be eating apples. The person who likes green lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who has a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 3, we know the gameboy owner lives to the left of the mystery book reader. From clue 2, the soccer player lives to the left of the mystery book reader. So, the order is: gameboy owner, soccer player, mystery book reader.

Now, from clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy owner, soccer player, and mystery book reader are to the left of the rose bouquet owner, the rose bouquet owner must be in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the minivan driver can't be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the minivan driver), and the minivan driver can't be in house 4 (since the person who drives a truck lives to the left of the minivan driver).

2. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
   - This means the dog owner can't be in house 1 (since there's only one house between the truck driver and the dog owner), and the dog owner can't be in house 4 (since there are two houses between the truck driver and the dog owner).

3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the truck driver can't be in house 1 (since the sedan owner lives to the right of the truck driver), and the truck driver can't be in house 4 (since the sedan owner lives to the right of the truck driver).

4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the fish enthusiast can't be in house 1 (since the dog owner lives to the right of the fish enthusiast), and the fish enthusiast can't be in house 4 (since the dog owner lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).

5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - This means the cat lover can be in house 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's try to place the people in the houses:

- Since the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner, the fish enthusiast can't be in house 1 (since the dog owner lives to the right of the fish enthusiast). The fish enthusiast can be in house 2 or 3.
- Since the cat lover does not live in the second house, the cat lover can be in house 1, 3, or 4.
- Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, the truck driver can be in house 1 or 2.
- Since the person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast, the minivan driver can be in house 3 or 4.

Let's try to place the people in the houses:

- If the fish enthusiast lives in house 2, the dog owner lives in house 3, and the cat lover lives in house 1. This is a possible solution.
- If the fish enthusiast lives in house 3, the dog owner lives in house 4, and the cat lover lives in house 1. This is also a possible solution.

However, we need to check if both solutions satisfy all the clues.

Solution 1:
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This is satisfied.
- There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives. This is satisfied.
- The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. This is satisfied.
- The cat lover does not live in the second house. This is satisfied.
- The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner. This is satisfied.

Solution 2:
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This is satisfied.
- There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives. This is satisfied.
- The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. This is satisfied.
- The cat lover does not live in the second house. This is satisfied.
- The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner. This is not satisfied.

Since Solution 1 satisfies all the clues, the dog owner lives in house 3."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes milk is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the fourth house.
- The root beer lover lives in the second house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water.

So, the person who likes white must live in the second house. 

Now, from clue 1, we know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house. However, we already know the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house. 

This means our initial assumption about the person who likes blue must be incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the clues.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

However, we know the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house. This means the person who likes blue must be in the third house. 

So, the correct order is:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
- The person who likes blue lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the fourth house.
- The root beer lover lives in the second house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.

The person who likes blue lives in the third house. The answer is (C) 3."

"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the correct order of the people.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.

From clue 8, we know the cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the person who likes white must live in the third house.

From clue 9, we know the cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the cricketer lives in the fourth house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the fifth house, but we already know the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.

Since the tennis player lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the fifth house, but we already know the cricketer lives in the fifth house. This means the person who is eating mangos must live in the sixth house, but we already know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the sixth house. This means the person who is eating mangos must live in the seventh house, but we already know the person who likes blue lives in the seventh house. This means the person who is eating mangos must live in the eighth house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   This means the cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   Since the cellist lives in house 1, the dog owner must live in house 2.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2. The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person with the gameboy lives in house 3. From clue 4, we know the person with the radio lives to the right of the person with the gameboy, so the person with the radio lives in house 4.

From clue 2, we know the person with the minivan lives in house 1. From clue 3, we know the person with the phone lives directly left of the person with the SUV. Since the person with the radio lives in house 4, the person with the phone must live in house 3. But we already know the person with the gameboy lives in house 3, so the person with the phone must be the person with the gameboy. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Let's re-evaluate clue 3. If the person with the phone lives directly left of the person with the SUV, and the person with the radio lives in house 4, then the person with the SUV must live in house 2. This is because the person with the phone must live in house 3, and the person with the gameboy lives in house 3. The person with the radio lives in house 4.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 2: SUV
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Radio

The only remaining characteristic is the truck. The person with the truck must live in house 1, but we already know the person with the minivan lives in house 1. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues again.

Let's re-evaluate clue 5. If the person with the convertible does not live in the third house, then the person with the convertible must live in either house 1 or house 4. But the person with the radio lives in house 4, so the person with the convertible must live in house 1.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Radio

The only remaining characteristic is the computer. The person with the computer must live in house 2, but we already know the person with the SUV lives in house 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues again.

Let's re-evaluate clue 6. If the person with the computer does not live in the first house, then the person with the computer must live in either house 2 or house 4. But the person with the radio lives in house 4, so the person with the computer must live in house 2.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Radio

The only remaining characteristic is the truck. The person with the truck must live in house 1, which is correct.

The correct arrangement is:
- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Radio

The person who owns an SUV lives in house 2. The correct answer is (D) 2."

4. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house (Clue 3).
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover (Clue 5).

From Clue 2, we know the order of the houses is:

From Clue 1, we know the order of the houses is: 
- ? (since the person who likes green lives to the left of the history book buff)

- History book buff
- ? (since the person who likes green lives to the left of the history book buff)

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the order is: 
- Yellow
- ? (since the person who likes green lives to the left of the history book buff)
- Romance book lover
- History book buff

From Clue 3, we know the person who had pizza does not live in the first house. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the person who had pizza must live in the second or third house.

- Fried rice
- History book buff

Now, we have to find the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green lives to the left of the history book buff, and the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the person who likes green must live in the second house.

- Yellow

"Let's break down the clues:

2. The golfer doesn't live in the second house.
3. The person with a computer and the person with a vase of tulips live next to each other.
4. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet.
5. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television.

From clue 1, the tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television. This means the person with a television can't be in house 1 either.

From clue 2, the golfer doesn't live in the second house. This means the golfer can live in either house 1 or house 3.

This means they can't be in house 2 (because the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet, and the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television). 

Now, let's try to fit the people in the houses:

- If the golfer lives in house 1, the person with a computer and the person with a vase of tulips must live in house 2. But then the person with a radio can't live in house 2 (because the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet). This means the person with a radio must live in house 3. The person with a rose bouquet must live in house 2, and the person with a television must live in house 1. But then the tennis player can't live to the left of the person with a television. This is a contradiction.

- If the golfer lives in house 3, the person with a computer and the person with a vase of tulips must live in house 1. The person with a radio can live in house 2, and the person with a rose bouquet can live in house 3. This arrangement satisfies all the clues.

So, the person with a computer lives in house 1."

"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the correct order of the people.

From clue 7, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.

From clue 9, we know the person who drives a convertible lives to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who drives a truck must live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first house. However, we already know the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 8, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house. However, we already know the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 1, we know the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person who drives a truck lives in the third house, the person who had stew must live in the first or second house. However, we already know the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, and the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the third or fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the person who drives a truck lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house.

From clue 6, we know the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the person who drives a truck lives in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the second house. However, we already know the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must be the person who is wearing boots.

From clue 10 is not given, but we can deduce the following:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third or fourth house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
- The person who owns an SUV lives in the second house.
- The person who drives a truck lives in the third house.
- The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
- The person who is wearing high heels lives in the fourth house.
- The person who had stew lives in the second house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
- The person who had pizza lives in the remaining house.

Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who owns an SUV lives in the second house, and the person who drives a truck lives in the third house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house. The person who is wearing high heels must live in the fourth house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who had pizza must live in the remaining house, which is the first house.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given clues to deduce the correct order of the houses.

From clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know there is one house between the percussionist and the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house, the percussionist must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. So, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know there is one house between the history book buff and the guitarist. Since the percussionist lives in the third house and the romance book lover lives in the second house, the history book buff must live in the first house, and the guitarist must live in the fifth house.

From clue 6, we know the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist lives in the fourth house, the violinist must live in the fifth house.

So, the correct order of the houses is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Saxophonist
5. Violinist

The answer is (E) 5."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing loafers lives in the second house. From clue 4, the person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing loafers, so the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the person with the television lives in the fourth house. From clue 5, the person with the radio lives two houses to the left of the person with the sandals. Since the person with the television lives in the fourth house, the person with the radio lives in the second house (because there are two houses between the person with the radio and the person with the sandals). 

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: ? (we don't know yet)
- House 4: Television

From clue 3, the person with the phone does not live in the second house. Since the person with the radio lives in the second house, the person with the phone must live in either the first or the third house. However, the person with the boots lives in the first house, so the person with the phone must live in the third house.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

The only person left is the person wearing sandals, who must live in the fourth house. However, this is already occupied by the person with the television. This is a contradiction. 

However, re-examining the clues, we can see that the person wearing sandals can't live in the fourth house because the person with the television lives there. The person wearing sandals must live in the third house, and the person with the phone must live in the first house.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Phone
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

The only person left is the person wearing loafers, who must live in the second house.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Phone
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Television

The person with the gameboy must live in the third house, which is house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house. From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house. 

Now, let's look at clue 3, which says the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Clue 4 says the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, and the coffee drinker does not live in the second house, the person wearing high heels must be the milk drinker. 

So, the order of the houses is:
- The person wearing high heels (milk drinker) lives in the second house.
- The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
- The person wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From the first clue, we know that the person wearing loafers lives in either house 1 or house 2. 

From the second clue, we know that the mystery book reader does not live in house 2. This means the mystery book reader must live in house 1.

Since the person wearing loafers cannot live in house 1 (from the first clue), the person wearing loafers must live in house 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

Now, let's try to place the people in the houses:

- The person who is wearing boots lives in house 1 (since they live to the left of the person who had pizza).
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 1 (since they live to the left of the person who had pizza).
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 2 (since they live next to the person who is wearing running shoes).
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 2 (since they live next to the person who has a rose bouquet).
- The person who is wearing gameboy lives in house 2 (since they live next to the person who is wearing running shoes).
- The person who had stew lives in house 3 (since the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house).
- The person who has a television lives in house 3 (since they live to the left of the person who has a radio).
- The person who has a radio lives in house 4 (since they live to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 4 (since they live to the left of the person who has a radio).
- The person who had pizza lives in house 2 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals).

The person who is wearing sandals lives in house 4 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals).

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person with lilies lives in house 2.

2. The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   Since the person with mangos lives in the first house, the saxophonist must live in the second house.

3. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   This confirms that the person with mangos lives in house 1.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: person eating mangos, playing piano (since the saxophonist lives in house 2), and has a rose bouquet.
- House 2: person eating apples, playing saxophone, and has lilies.

So, the person eating apples lives in house 2."

- The person who had stew lives in the first house (because the person who likes blue lives in the first house).
- The romance book lover lives in the second house (because the person who likes yellow lives in the second house).
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house (because the person who likes green lives in the third house).

So, the order of the houses is: 
- The person who had stew (blue) lives in the first house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.
- The person who likes green lives in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in the first house. The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given clues to deduce the correct order of the houses.

From clue 1, we know the bird keeper and the person with tulips live next to each other. 

From clue 2, we know there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. 

From clue 3, we know the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet.

From clue 6, we know the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.

From clue 7, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.

From clue 8, we know the cellist does not live in the third house.

Now, let's start from the first house. Since the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the second house.

From clue 1, the bird keeper and the person with tulips live next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the bird keeper and the person with tulips must live in the first and second houses. 

From clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house, the percussionist must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house, but this is already occupied by the person with a rose bouquet. So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house, but this is occupied by the person with a carnations arrangement. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by considering the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast, and the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. This means the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the third house.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. There is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house. Since there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic, the swimmer must live in the third house. 

So, the order of the houses is:
- History book buff (1)
- Golfer (2)
- Science fiction book fanatic (3)

Therefore, the swimmer lives in house 3. The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and narrow down the possibilities.

From clue 1, we know the swimmer lives directly left of the person eating apples. Since the swimmer can't be in the fourth house (clue 4), the swimmer must be in either the first or second house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer. If the swimmer is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the second house. If the swimmer is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the bird keeper lives in the third house (clue 8), the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house (because the romance book lover is in the third house). This means the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the cat lover lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the history book buff must be in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the soccer player must be in the third house.

From clue 9, the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house. This means the person who had pizza must be in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the baseball player must be in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: science fiction book fanatic, eating bananas, lives directly left of the soccer player
- House 2: fantasy book enthusiast, eating oranges, lives directly left of the person who owns horses
- House 3: bird keeper, eating grapes, lives directly left of the person who had pizza
- House 4: baseball player, eating fried rice, lives directly left of the person who had stew

The only person left is the person who ate stew, who must be in the fourth house."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   This means the person who owns horses lives in house 2, and the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   Since the person who owns horses lives in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1.

Now, let's look at the remaining characteristics:
- One person is a cat lover, and one is a horse lover. Since the person who owns horses lives in house 2, the cat lover must live in house 1.
- One person is a romance book lover. Since the history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1, the romance book lover must live in house 2.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 1."

From clue 2, we know the flutist does not live in the first house. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2, the flutist must live in house 1.

Now, let's look at the remaining options:
- The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, so the person who owns a sedan must live in house 1.
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 2, but we already know that house 2 is occupied by the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1.

From clue 6, the person with the rose bouquet lives in the third house, which is the golfer.

From clue 7, the tennis player does not live in the fourth house. Since the golfer lives in the third house, the tennis player must live in the first or second house.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the person with daffodils lives and where the person with the rose bouquet lives. Since the person with daffodils lives in the third house and the person with the rose bouquet lives in the third house, this clue is not possible. However, we can re-evaluate clue 8. There is one house between where the person with daffodils lives and where the person with the rose bouquet lives. Since the person with daffodils lives in the third house, the person with the rose bouquet must live in the fourth house, but this contradicts clue 3. So, the person with the rose bouquet must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the tennis player lives to the right of the mystery book reader. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

From clue 9, there are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives. Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the romance book lover must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who likes white lives in the first house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. 

From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. From clue 7, we know the person who had stew does not live in the second house. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house. We already know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. So, the person who likes green must be the person who ate fried rice.

Now, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, and the person who had stew lives in the third house. The only remaining house is the first house, where the person who likes white lives. The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, and the person who had stew lives in the third house. The person who is wearing high heels cannot live in the third house, so the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house.

So, the person who is wearing high heels is the person who likes white, the person who is wearing boots is the person who likes green, and the person who ate spaghetti is the person who likes red. 

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. The answer is (A) 2."

3. The romance book lover lives to the left of the person with tulips.
4. The person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.
5. The person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2. Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3.

From clue 2, we know the romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2, the person with carnations must live in house 1.

From clue 3, we know the romance book lover lives to the left of the person with tulips. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2, the person with tulips must live in house 4.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person with carnations
- House 2: person with rose bouquet
- House 3: person with science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: person with tulips

From clue 1, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 1.

2. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1. Since the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, the coffee drinker must live in house 1.

Now, we know the coffee drinker lives in house 1 and the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1. This means the person wearing sandals must live in house 2.

The only person left is the romance book lover. Since the coffee drinker lives in house 1, the romance book lover must live in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information:

1. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
2. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.

From the first clue, we know that the percussionist lives in house 1, because if the percussionist lived in house 2, the person with the radio would have to live in house 1, which contradicts the fact that the person with the radio lives in house 2.

Now, let's look at the devices:
- The person in house 1 has a percussion instrument (clue 1) and a radio (contradiction, since the person with the radio lives in house 2).
- The person in house 2 has a radio and a phone.

Since the person in house 1 has a percussion instrument, and the person in house 2 has a radio, the person in house 1 must have a phone.

Therefore, the person who has a phone lives in house 1."

Now, let's look at clue 2. It says there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, the person who likes white must live in house 1. 

So, the order of the houses is: 
- House 1: person who likes white
- House 2: person who drives a convertible
- House 3: person who owns a sedan

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1. 

However, we already know the person who likes white lives in house 1. This means our initial assumption was incorrect. Let's re-analyze the clues.

From clue 1, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2. 

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1. 

From clue 2, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, the person who owns a sedan must live in house 3. 

So, the order of the houses is: 
- House 1: person who likes yellow
- House 2: person who drives a convertible
- House 3: person who owns a sedan

The correct answer is (B) 1."

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house (clue 2), the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in the same house. 

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice are in the same house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.

So, the order is:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic (ate grilled cheese)

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

So, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   This means the person who is wearing high heels cannot be in house 1 because the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. So, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 2.

2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   Since the person who is wearing high heels is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1.

3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   Since the person who is wearing high heels is in house 2, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 2.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: person wearing sandals, eating grapes, and drinking water
- House 2: person wearing high heels, eating kiwis, and drinking milk

The person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

2. The person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know that the person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live next to each other. Since they live in houses 1 and 2, and the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, the order is: 

- House 1: person wearing high heels, person eating grapes
- House 2: person wearing sandals, person eating kiwis

Now, let's look at clue 3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a television. Since the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, the tea drinker must live in house 1. 

So, the order is: 

- House 1: tea drinker, person wearing high heels, person eating grapes
- House 2: person wearing sandals, person eating kiwis

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2. The answer is (A) 2."

1. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   This means the water drinker can be in house 2 or 3.

2. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   This means the guitarist can be in house 1 or 3, and the violinist can be in house 2.

3. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   This means the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. The violinist does not live in the third house.
   This means the violinist can be in house 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The tea drinker lives in house 1.
- The violinist can be in house 1 or 2.
- The water drinker lives to the right of the cellist, and the guitarist lives to the right of the violinist.
- The guitarist can be in house 1 or 3.

Considering all the possibilities, the only arrangement that satisfies all the conditions is:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 3."

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
2. The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
3. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
4. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
5. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
6. The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. Since there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives, and the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the fourth house.

- Clue 2 states that the person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. Since they can't be in the same house (clue 1), they must be in houses 1 and 2, in that order. 

Now, let's analyze the possible positions of the cellist and the mystery book reader. From clue 1, the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. If the cellist lives in house 1, the mystery book reader must live in house 2. If the cellist lives in house 2, the mystery book reader must live in house 1.

However, from clue 2, the history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. If the cellist lives in house 1, the history book buff must live in house 1, and the cat lover must live in house 2. But this would mean the root beer lover and the guitarist live in house 2, which is not possible (clue 3). So, the cellist must live in house 2, and the mystery book reader must live in house 1.

Now, we know the order of the houses is: 
- House 1: mystery book reader
- House 2: cellist
- House 1: history book buff
- House 2: root beer lover
- House 1: cat lover

From the above order, we can see that the cat lover lives in house 1. 

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

From clue 1, we know the bird keeper lives to the left of the person with carnations. 

From clue 2, we know the dog owner cannot live in the second house. 

From clue 3, we know the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner. 

Since the dog owner cannot live in the second house, and the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner, the dog owner must live in the first house. 

The person with tulips cannot live in the first house because the dog owner lives there. 

The person with tulips must live in the third house. 

The person with carnations must live in the second house because the bird keeper lives to the left of the person with carnations, and the person with tulips lives in the third house.

So, the order of the houses is: 
- Dog owner: 1
- Bird keeper: 2
- Person with tulips: 3
- Person with carnations: 2"

Now, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the second house is occupied by the bird keeper, and the third house is occupied by the history book buff. 

The only person left is the romance book lover, and since the romance book lover does not live in the third house, they must live in the second house. However, we know the bird keeper lives in the second house.

"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and narrow down the possibilities.

From clue 6, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. 

From clue 8, we know the basketball player lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 9, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 10, we know the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. 

From clue 11, we know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. 

From clue 12, we know the person who likes green does not live in the third house. 

From clue 13, we know the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 14, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. 

From clue 15, we know the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.

Now, let's try to place the people in the houses:

- The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house (clue 9).
- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house (clue 13).
- The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house (clue 15).
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist (clue 14).
- The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other (clue 5).
- The person who had pizza cannot live in the fourth house because the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house (clue 9).
- The person who had pizza must live in the third house.
- The person who had stew lives in the second house (clue 5).
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house (clue 15).
- The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan (clue 3).
- The person who likes red cannot live in the first house because the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house (clue 3).
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The person who likes green does not live in the third house (clue 12).
- The person who likes green lives in the fourth house.
- The person who owns a convertible does not live in the first house (clue 4).

- The cellist lives in the third house (clue 10).
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house (clue 14).
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house (clue 11).

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person who owns a sedan, person who ate grilled cheese, person who likes red, person who likes green
- House 2: person who had stew, person who had pizza, person who likes blue, person who likes white
- House 3: person who owns a convertible, person who owns a sedan is not here, person who likes blue is not here, person who likes green is not here, person who likes red is not here, person who had pizza is here, person who had stew is here, person who owns a convertible is here, person who is a flutist is here, person who is a cellist is here
- House 4: person who owns an SUV, person who likes white, person who is a soccer player, person who is a basketball player

The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
4. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
5. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes red lives in the second house. From clue 5, we know the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who has a phone must live in the first house.

Now, let's look at clue 3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house. From clue 4, we know the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples must live in the first or second house.

Now, let's combine the information. We know the person who has a phone lives in the first house, the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person who is eating apples lives in the first or second house. Since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who is eating apples must live in the first house.

The person who is eating apples lives in the first house, the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person who has a phone lives in the first house. This means the person who is wearing boots must live in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 2 again. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house, the person who has a phone must live in the first house.

So, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given clues to narrow down the possible locations for each characteristic.

From clue 10, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the dog owner lives in the second house, the bird keeper must live in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, the violinist must live in the third house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, the guitarist must live in the second house, and the person who had pizza must live in the third house.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. Since the guitarist lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house, but we already know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be the bird keeper, which is not possible. However, we can re-evaluate clue 8. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the guitarist must live in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

From clue 1, the bird keeper lives in the second house. 

The answer is (C) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   Since the saxophonist lives in the first house, the tea drinker and the person eating grapes must live in house 2.

2. The saxophonist and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   Since the saxophonist lives in the first house, the golfer must live in house 1.

3. The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   Since the person eating grapes lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 2.

4. The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   Since the golfer lives in house 1, the romance book lover must live in house 1.

5. The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   Since the tea drinker lives in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 2.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the person eating grapes lives in house 2. Since the person eating grapes lives in house 2, the person eating mangos must live in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in the first house. Clue 3 also tells us that the person with boots lives in the first house. 

Since the person with boots lives in the first house, and the person with daffodils also lives in the first house, we can conclude that the person with boots is the same person as the person with daffodils. 

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person with lilies does not live in the second house. Clue 2 tells us that the person with high heels does not live in the second house. Since the person with boots (and daffodils) lives in the first house, the person with high heels must live in the second house. 

So, the person with boots (and daffodils) lives in house 1, and the person with high heels lives in house 2. 

The answer is (A) 1."

- The person who is wearing sandals cannot be in the first house because the cricketer lives to the right of the person who is wearing sandals (clue 11). 
- The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player (clue 13), so the basketball player must be in the third house.

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza (clue 5), so the tea drinker must be in the first or second house.

Now, let's try to find a possible arrangement of the people.

- The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels (clue 2), so the root beer lover must be in the second house.
- The person who is wearing high heels cannot be in the first house because the person who had pizza lives in the first house (clue 5).

The possible arrangement is:
1. Tea drinker
2. Root beer lover

5. Person who had pizza

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the correct order of the people.

From clue 2, we know the tea drinker lives in the first house.
From clue 3, the tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the tea drinker is in the first house, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, which is already occupied by the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and they live in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

From clue 6, there are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. This means the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house.

From clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house, the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house, and the person who likes red must live in the fifth house.

From clue 10, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, the person who likes white must live in the second house.

From clue 11, the root beer lover does not live in the third house. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house, the root beer lover must live in the first, second, or fifth house.

From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who had stew lives. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the third or fourth house.

From clue 13, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who likes red must live in the third house, and the person who likes green must live in the fifth house.

From clue 14, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the coffee drinker must live in the first, second, or third house.

Now, let's combine all the information:

- The tea drinker lives in the first house.
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes red lives in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 12, we know the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house. Clue 13 tells us the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.

From clue 8, we know the person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. Since the person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house (clue 2), the person who drives a minivan must live in the first or second house. Given that the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the baseball player lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house. The person who drives a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck (clue 3), and the person who drives a truck does not live in the second house (clue 1). Therefore, the person who drives a sedan must live in the third house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the third house. The person who drives a sedan lives in the third house, so the person who had stew must be the person who drives a sedan.

From clue 9, we know the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover. Since the person who drives a sedan lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the fourth house.

From clue 15, we know the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player. Since the person who drives a sedan lives in the third house, the baseball player must live in the second house, and the soccer player must live in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: 
  - Person who has a vase of tulips
  - Person who ate spaghetti
  - Person who drives a minivan
  - Person who drives a convertible

- House 2: 
  - Person who has a rose bouquet

From the above arrangement, we can see that the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house. The answer is (C) 4."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - Since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1 (because the person who eats grapes lives left of the truck driver). 
   - The person who eats grapes must be in house 1.

2. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - We already know the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: 
  - Person 1: likes yellow, eats oranges, reads mystery books, wears running shoes
  - Person 2: likes red, eats grapes, reads fantasy books, wears boots

- House 2: 
  - Person 1: likes red, eats oranges, reads fantasy books, drives a truck

- House 1: person who drives a minivan, person who likes yellow, person who ate fried rice
- House 2: person who likes white, person who likes blue, person who drives a minivan, person who is a romance book lover, person who ate spaghetti

- House 5: person who drives a convertible

From clue 1, we know the history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in house 4, the history book buff lives in house 3.

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 10, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.

From clue 11, we know the violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes blue lives directly left of the romance book lover (clue 6), the violinist must be the romance book lover.

From clue 1, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in either the first, second, or fourth house.

From clue 2, the golfer lives in the fourth house. Since the person who likes blue lives directly left of the romance book lover, and the violinist is the romance book lover, the person who likes blue must live in the second house. The person who likes blue cannot live in the fourth house because the golfer lives there.

From clue 3, there are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, and the saxophonist lives in the fifth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the soccer player must live in the first house, and the guitarist lives in the fourth house.

Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the second house, and the person who likes red lives in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player. Since the person who had pizza lives in the third house, the basketball player must live in the fourth house, but this contradicts clue 2, which states the golfer lives in the fourth house. This means the basketball player must live in the third house, and the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

However, we know from clue 11 that the violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the violinist must live in the third house, which is occupied by the basketball player. This means the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

This is because the violinist and basketball player are the only two people who can live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- Cricketer: House 1
- Violinist (basketball player): House 2
- Cello: House 3

The only person left is the soccer player. Since the soccer player is the only one left, they must live in the first house.

- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
- The person who likes green lives in the second house.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.

From clue 1, we know the violinist lives in house 1. 

From clue 2, we know the person with a computer lives to the left of the bird keeper. Since the violinist lives in house 1, the person with a computer must live in house 1 as well. 

Now, we know the person with a computer lives in house 1, and the violinist also lives in house 1. 

The only person left is the bird keeper, and since the person with a computer lives to the left of the bird keeper, the bird keeper must live in house 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and narrow down the possibilities.

From clue 4, we know the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house. From clue 8, we know the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff must live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. From clue 3, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the first house.

From clue 10, we know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. From clue 5, we know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house.

From clue 11, we know the romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. From clue 19, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the third house.

From clue 12, we know the person who has a television lives in the third house. From clue 18, we know the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. This means the person who has a computer must live in the fourth house.

From clue 16, we know the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a computer lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the third house.

From clue 13, we know the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the second house.

From clue 17, we know the person who has a phone does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who has a computer lives in the fourth house, the person who has a phone must live in the first house.

From clue 20, we know the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house. From clue 6, we know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the fifth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

- Person with boots
- Person with carnations arrangement

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the person wearing boots lives in the second house, the person wearing boots cannot be the cat lover. 

From clue 4, the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person wearing boots cannot be in the first house (since the cat lover is in the first house). 

From clue 2, the person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house. This means the person wearing boots is in the third house (because the person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner, and the person wearing boots lives in the second house).

From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. Since the person wearing boots is in the third house, the person wearing boots must be the person who owns a sedan.

Now, let's summarize the information so far:
- The cat lover lives in the first house.
- The person wearing boots lives in the third house (owns a sedan).
- The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.

Since the person wearing boots lives in the third house, the person wearing high heels must be in the second house (because the dog owner lives in the second house). The person wearing high heels cannot be the cat lover (since the cat lover is in the first house). 

The only person left is the dog owner, who must be in the second house. This means the person wearing high heels is the dog owner.

Now, we know the following:
- The cat lover lives in the first house.
- The dog owner lives in the second house.
- The person wearing boots lives in the third house.

The only person left is the person wearing running shoes, who must be in the first house (since the cat lover is in the first house).

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the house numbered 1."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the tea drinker lives in the third house, the person eating kiwis must live in the second house, and the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. This confirms our previous conclusion.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house. This confirms our previous conclusion.

From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the third house. However, we already know the tea drinker lives in the third house, so the person who likes green must be the tea drinker.

From clue 7, we know the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. This confirms our previous conclusion.

From clue 8, we know the person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house. Since the tea drinker lives in the third house, the person eating oranges must live in either the first or second house. However, we already know the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, so the person eating oranges must live in the first house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person eating oranges lives in the first house.
- The person eating kiwis lives in the second house.
- The person who likes blue lives in the first house.
- The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live in the first house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
- The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
- The person who likes green lives in the third house.

Since the person eating oranges lives in the first house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be the person wearing running shoes. The person wearing running shoes lives in the first house, so the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first house.

The person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the third house. Therefore, the person who is wearing boots must be the person who likes green.

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house, and the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must be the person eating kiwis.

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house, and the person who likes blue lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be the person who likes blue.

The person who is eating apples lives in the first house, and the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live in the first house. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must be the person who likes milk.

The person who is eating apples lives in the first house, so the answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.

2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
   - This is already stated.

4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the mystery book reader lives in the first house, the person with the television must live in the second house.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Phone, Television
- House 3: History book buff

The French Defense is a popular chess opening, but it's not foolproof. While it can be a solid choice, it's not invincible. There are many lines and variations that can lead to checkmate.

In general, the French Defense can be vulnerable to certain pawn structures and piece development, which can put the player in a difficult position. Additionally, some lines can lead to weaknesses on the kingside, making it easier for the opponent to launch a successful attack.

That being said, the French Defense is a popular choice among players of all skill levels, and it can be a great way to counterattack and create counterplay. However, it's not a guarantee against checkmate, and players need to be aware of the potential risks and be prepared to adapt to different responses from their opponents."

Robert Wadlow was known as the ""Giant of Illinois"" and was the tallest person in recorded history, standing at 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m). A German Shepherd is a breed of dog, and they typically stand between 24-26 inches (61-66 cm) tall at the shoulder. So, Robert Wadlow would definitely tower over a German Shepherd."

They had a lot of hit songs like ""I Want You Back"" and ""ABC"". The Isley Brothers were cool too, but I don't think they were as big as The Jackson 5."
A: A
"I think the Wall Street Crash of 1929 happened a long time ago, and I'm not really sure what robotics companies were like back then. But I do know that the Wall Street Crash of 1929 was a big event that happened when many people lost a lot of money in the stock market.

"I don't think so. Justin Bieber is a singer, and Mike Pence was the Vice President of the United States. They are two very different people with different jobs. Mike Pence was the Vice President under Donald Trump, and he stepped down after Trump left office. Justin Bieber is a famous musician, not a politician. So, it's unlikely that Justin Bieber would take over Mike Pence's position. The answer is (B) No."

(B) Yes
(B) No
"I think it would be (A) Yes. A slingshot is a simple, handheld device used to launch small objects, like rocks or marbles. It's not a large, heavy, or complex device like a cannon or a howitzer, which are typically considered artillery. Artillery is usually defined as heavy, large-caliber guns used for military purposes. A slingshot doesn't fit that description, so it wouldn't be classified as artillery."

"I don't think so. Dafne Keen is an actress, not a singer. She's known for her roles in movies like ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" and ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"". Eurovision is a singing competition, so I don't think she would be eligible to participate."
"I think they would struggle at a UPS job. 

Iris, from Greek mythology, is a goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods. She's very fast and agile, but she's also very magical and has a lot of powers. 

Hermes, from Greek mythology, is also a messenger of the gods and is known for being very fast and clever. He's also very good at navigating and has a magical winged sandals.

However, a UPS job requires a lot of physical labor, working with packages, and following rules. I think Iris and Hermes might struggle with the physical demands of the job, especially Iris, who is a goddess and might not be used to manual labor. They might also struggle with following rules and being on time, as they're used to being free and doing their own thing."

"I think the answer is (B) Yes. The Gunpowder plot was a failed assassination attempt against King James I of England in 1605. Mary, Queen of Scots, was the Queen of Scotland at that time. She was a Catholic and had a claim to the English throne, which made her a rival to King James I, who was a Protestant. The plot was led by a group of conspirators who wanted to blow up the English Parliament and kill King James I. 

Although the plot failed, it led to Mary, Queen of Scots, being implicated in the conspiracy and eventually executed in 1587 for treason. This meant that her claim to the English throne was eliminated, and her bloodline was cut off."
"I think the main character of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" would not be able to join a Masonic Lodge. 

The story is about a girl who falls down a rabbit hole and enters a fantastical world where she encounters strange creatures and logic-defying situations. The Masonic Lodge is a real-life organization with its own set of rituals, symbols, and codes. The story is not set in the real world, and the characters are not meant to be taken literally.

In the story, Alice is a fictional character, and her adventures are not meant to be taken as a guide for real-life events or organizations. Therefore, it's unlikely that she would be able to join a Masonic Lodge in the real world."
"I think (B) No. I've seen in movies that crocodiles are super strong and have really sharp teeth, but I also know that bull sharks are known to be pretty aggressive and have a lot of sharp teeth too."

In the story of Snow White, the Evil Queen is trying to get rid of Snow White by disguising herself as an old hag and offering her a poisoned apple.

It's more like coercion and manipulation."

Binary numbers and standard alphabet can be used to create passwords, but they might not be strong enough. 

Binary numbers are just 0s and 1s, which can be easily guessed by someone who knows the pattern. 

Standard alphabet has 26 letters, which can also be guessed if someone knows the pattern or has a list of common words.

A strong password should be unique, long, and not easily guessable. Using a combination of numbers and letters, like a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers, can make a password more secure."
"I think it's (B) Yes. A rainbow is formed when the sun shines through water droplets in the air, like after a rain. If you're on the beach, you might see rain after a storm, and the sun shining through the water, so it's possible to see a rainbow."

Explanation: A supersonic shock wave is a shock wave that travels faster than the speed of sound. Gunpowder explosions typically produce shock waves that are supersonic, but the shock wave itself isn't supersonic. The shock wave is created by the rapid expansion of gases, but the speed of the shock wave is usually subsonic, meaning it's slower than the speed of sound."

"I think it's a bit of both, but I'll try to break it down.

A 500GB USB device can hold a lot of data, but it depends on the quality of the shows and how much space each episode takes up.

Assuming an average Netflix show is around 30-60 minutes long, and each episode is around 500MB to 1GB in size, a 500GB device can hold around 50-100 episodes.

If you watch 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, that's around 600 minutes or 10 episodes. So, a 500GB device might be enough to hold 5-10 episodes, depending on the size of the episodes.

However, if the shows are very high-quality or have a lot of special features, they might take up more space. So, it's possible that a 500GB device might not be enough to hold 10 hours of shows.

So, I would say... (A) No, it might not be enough, but it depends on the specific shows."
"I think I can answer that.

Jon Brower Minnoch was a man who was known for being extremely strong. He was a professional weightlifter and could lift very heavy weights. 

Voyager 2 is a spacecraft that was launched in 1977. It's a very heavy spacecraft, but I don't think it's as heavy as Jon Brower Minnoch.

The pins in a bowling alley lane are made of metal and are designed to withstand the impact of the bowling ball. Dustin Hoffman's Oscars are awards, not objects that can be used as pins. They are made of gold and are very valuable, so it wouldn't be safe or practical to use them as pins."

Beavers have big, flat teeth that are perfect for gnawing wood, but they're not as sharp or powerful as the teeth of a Smilodon, which was a prehistoric saber-toothed cat. Smilodon's teeth were much sharper and more curved, and were used for hunting and killing large prey."

The torso is the middle part of the body, and it's made up of several bones, including the ribcage and the vertebrae. The largest bone in the torso is the ribcage, which is made up of 12 pairs of ribs that protect the heart and lungs. The smallest bone in the torso is the vertebrae, specifically the smallest vertebrae in the spine, which are called the L5 vertebrae (the fifth lumbar vertebra).

Since the ribcage and vertebrae are part of the torso, and they are made of bone, they are relatively hard and can provide some protection against blows. However, it's not a guarantee that the torso will be completely safe from all blows. But in general, the torso is a relatively protected area of the body."

From my knowledge, I know that the number of Jesus' disciples is not well-documented, but it's believed to be around 12.

"To answer this question, we need to know the approximate number of unemployed people in the United States in 1933.

According to historical records, in 1933, the unemployment rate in the United States was around 24.9%. This means that about 1 in 4 people were unemployed.

Now, let's estimate the total number of people in the United States in 1933. The population of the United States in 1933 was approximately 123 million people.

If we multiply the population by the unemployment rate, we get:

123,000,000 x 0.249 = 30,747,000

So, approximately 30.7 million people were unemployed in 1933.

Now, let's consider Tiger Stadium, which is a large stadium with a seating capacity of around 100,000 people. 

Since 30.7 million people are more than 100,000, the answer is:

(B) Yes, all the unemployed people due to the 1933 Great Depression could fit in Tiger Stadium."

SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) are commonly prescribed to treat depression in teenagers and young adults. While there are some concerns about the potential risks of SSRIs, such as increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young people, the overall evidence suggests that SSRIs are generally safe and effective for treating depression in this age group.

In fact, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have both concluded that SSRIs are a safe and effective treatment option for depression in teenagers and young adults.

It's worth noting that the risks of suicidal thoughts and behaviors associated with SSRIs in young people are generally considered to be small, and the benefits of treatment often outweigh the risks. However, it's always a good idea for young people to be closely monitored by a healthcare provider while taking antidepressant medication."

Dorton Arena is a large indoor arena, but it's not that big. It's actually the home of the Penn State University wrestling team. I think it can hold around 15,000 people.

30th Street Station is a major transportation hub with many trains and buses passing through it. There are many people who pass through there every day, but I don't know the exact number.

If we assume that 30th Street Station is very busy, let's say it can hold 50,000 people (which is a rough estimate). Since Dorton Arena can hold 15,000 people, it's not enough to fit all the people who pass through 30th Street Station every day. So, the answer is:

(B) No"

Since Paul's death involved violence (being stoned), it seems that his cause of death might have violated the tenets of Ahimsa."

The Thirty Years' War was a very long and brutal conflict that lasted from 1618 to 1648. It involved many countries in Europe, including Germany, where the white cockatoo is native. The war was fought with many battles, sieges, and famines, which would have made it very difficult for a bird to survive. Additionally, the war was a time of great destruction and chaos, which would have made it hard for a bird to find food and shelter. So, I think it's unlikely that a white cockatoo could have lived through the entire war."

In Japan, serfdom was a system where people were tied to the land and were required to work for the lord in exchange for protection and housing. However, serfs in Japan were not considered to be of the same social status as the nobility or the samurai class. They were considered to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy.

In England, serfdom was also present, but it was not as rigidly structured as in Japan. English serfs were considered to be of lower social status than the nobility, but they were also considered to be part of the emerging middle class. They had more rights and freedoms than Japanese serfs, and they were able to move up the social ladder through hard work and education.

So, while both systems had their own unique characteristics, I think it's fair to say that English serfs had a slightly higher status than Japanese serfs."

Andrew Johnson was the 17th President of the United States, and Elagabalus was a Roman Emperor.

"I think there's a bit of confusion here. Chris Sarandon is not a part of the Indian parliament, and I couldn't find any information about a person named Chris Sarandon having powers that make the Lok Sabha more powerful than the Rajya Sabha.

However, I can answer your question based on the context of the Indian parliament.

The Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) are the two houses of the Indian Parliament. The Lok Sabha is the lower house and has more members than the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha has more powers than the Lok Sabha in certain areas, such as:

1. Deliberation: The Rajya Sabha has the power to deliberate on bills for a longer period, which allows for more in-depth discussion and consideration.
2. Delayed Referendum: The Rajya Sabha can delay a bill for a longer period, giving it more time to consider the bill and its implications.
3. Financial Powers: The Rajya Sabha has the power to approve or reject the Union Budget, which gives it significant influence over the government's financial policies.

So, in this context, the Rajya Sabha is more powerful than the Lok Sabha in certain areas."
