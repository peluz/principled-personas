"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1, we know the flutist lives in house 2. 

From clue 2, the person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the flutist lives in house 2, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 1.

From clue 3, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 1, the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 3.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. Since the flutist lives in house 2, the pianist must live in house 4.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Person with vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Pianist

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 13, we know the cat lover lives in the first house, which is the same as the person who is eating kiwis. So, the cat lover is also in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house.

From clue 10, we know the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns horses is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. This is consistent with our current arrangement.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes milk does not live in the third house. This is also consistent with our current arrangement.

From clue 2, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.

From clue 12, we know the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third house.

From clue 3, we know there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.

From clue 9, we know the tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house.

From clue 11, we know the person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. This is inconsistent with our current arrangement, but we can fix it by swapping the positions of the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the flutist lives in the first house. This is consistent with our current arrangement.

So, the correct order is:
- House 1: cat lover (kiwis) - flutist
- House 2: fish enthusiast - guitarist
- House 3: person who owns horses - person who only drinks water
- House 4: person who likes milk - person who is eating oranges

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, which is house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 2, we know the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.

From clue 3, we know the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 4, we know the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 6, we know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 8, we know the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.

From clue 9, we know there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

From clue 10, we know the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

From clue 11, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Now, let's start by placing the person who has a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese, we can start with the following arrangement: 

rose - pizza - grilled cheese

From clue 4, we know the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the second position, the person who had stew must be in the third position. 

So, the arrangement becomes: 
rose - pizza - grilled cheese - stew

From clue 8, we know the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third position, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the fourth position. 

So, the arrangement becomes: 
rose - pizza - grilled cheese - vase of tulips - stew

From clue 3, we know the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house. This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the fourth position, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the fifth position.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house. This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the fifth position, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the fourth position.

So, the arrangement becomes: 
rose - pizza - grilled cheese - carnations - daffodils

From clue 10, we know the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the person who has a carnations arrangement is in the fourth position, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fifth position.

From clue 9, we know there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who is eating oranges is in the fifth position, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the third position.

From clue 2, we know the person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person who is eating oranges is in the fifth position, the person who is eating apples must be in the second position.

From clue 11, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who is eating apples is in the second position, the person who is eating mangos must be in the third position.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third position, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first position.

So, the arrangement becomes: 
spaghetti - apples - kiwis - carnations - daffodils

The person who had stew lives in the third position, which is house number 3."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
2. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, the dog owner must live in the third house. 

Now, let's look at clue 2. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house. This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

From clue 3, we know there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives. This means the person who owns horses and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second and fourth houses, or the third and fourth houses.

From clue 4, we know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. This means the person who owns horses must live in the first or second house.

Combining all the information, we can deduce the following:

- The cat lover lives in the first house.
- The dog owner lives in the third house.
- The person who owns horses lives in the second house.
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fourth house.

Now, we can determine the house of the fish enthusiast. Since the person who owns horses lives in the second house, and there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the person who owns horses, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house. 

Therefore, the fish enthusiast lives in the house that is left, which is the first house."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the person with the phone lives in house 1. 

From clue 2, we know the person wearing boots cannot live in house 2. 

From clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the person with the phone lives in house 1, the person who owns horses and has a radio must live in house 1 as well. 

Now, we have the following information:
- House 1: 
  - Person with phone
  - Person with horses
  - Person with radio

Since the person wearing boots cannot live in house 2, and the person with horses and radio live in house 1, the person wearing boots must live in house 2.

Now, we have the following information:
- House 1: 
  - Person with phone
  - Person with horses
  - Person with radio
- House 2: 
  - Person with boots

The only remaining characteristic is the device: one has a radio and one has a phone. Since the person with the phone lives in house 1, the person with the radio must live in house 2.

Now, we have the following information:
- House 1: 
  - Person with phone
  - Person with horses
- House 2: 
  - Person with boots
  - Person with radio

The only remaining characteristic is the pet: one owns horses and one is a dog owner. Since the person with horses lives in house 1, the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Now, we have the following information:
- House 1: 
  - Person with phone
  - Person with horses
- House 2: 
  - Person with boots
  - Person with radio
  - Person with dog

The only remaining characteristic is the shoe: one is wearing boots and one is wearing high heels. Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person wearing high heels must live in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. 

From clue 2, we know that the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. This means the person who has a computer must live in either the first or second house.

From clue 3, we know that the person who is eating apples does not live in the first house. This means the person who has a computer must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know that the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who has a computer lives in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the third house.

From clue 5, we know that there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives. Since the person who has a computer lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who has a phone must live in the third house.

From clue 6, we know that the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house. This means the person who is wearing loafers must live in either the first or second house.

From clue 7, we know that the person who had pizza does not live in the second house. This means the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From clue 8, we know that the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the second house.

From clue 9, we know that the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. This is already satisfied by the previous conclusions.

From clue 10, we know that the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone. This is already satisfied by the previous conclusions.

Now, let's summarize the information we have so far:

- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
- The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating mangos lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the third house.
- The person who has a phone lives in the third house.

The only person left is the person who likes blue, who must live in the first house.

So, the person who likes green lives in house 2."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 3, we know the baseball player lives in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the basketball player does not live in the first house (clue 1) and lives to the left of the swimmer (clue 2), the possible positions for the basketball player are houses 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 4, we know the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the dog owner must live in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the bird keeper does not live in the first house. Since the dog owner lives in the first house, the bird keeper must live in either the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the bird keeper does not live in the third house. So, the bird keeper must live in either the second or fourth house.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The dog owner lives in the first house.
- The baseball player lives in the second house.
- The bird keeper lives in either the second or fourth house.
- The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner.
- The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the bird keeper.

Since the bird keeper lives in either the second or fourth house, and the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the bird keeper, the fish enthusiast must live in the fourth house if the bird keeper lives in the second house. However, this would mean the bird keeper lives in the second house, which is not possible because the bird keeper cannot live in the second house (clue 5). Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the fourth house.

So, the bird keeper lives in house 4."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who has a computer. This means the person who likes white can be in house 2 or 3.

From clue 2, we know there is one house between the baseball player and the person who likes blue. This means the baseball player can be in house 1, and the person who likes blue can be in house 3.

From clue 3, we know the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. This means the person who owns a sedan can be in house 1, and the person who owns an SUV can be in house 2.

From clue 4, we know the swimmer lives to the right of the person who owns an SUV. This means the swimmer can be in house 3.

From clue 5, we know the violinist does not live in the first house. This means the violinist can be in house 2 or 3.

Now, let's combine all the information:

- The person who has a gameboy lives in house 2 (clue 6).
- The person who owns an SUV lives in house 2 (clue 3).

- The person who likes blue lives in house 3 (clue 2).
- The person who likes white lives in house 2 (clue 1).

Now we have the following arrangement: 
1. Sedan
2. White
3. Guitarist
4. Blue
5. Gameboy
6. Violinist
7. Swimmer

The only remaining house is for the baseball player. Since the baseball player lives to the left of the person who likes blue, the baseball player must live in house 1.

The final arrangement is:
1. Baseball player
2. White
3. Guitarist
4. Gameboy
5. Blue
6. Violinist
7. Swimmer

The soccer player lives in house 4."

From clue 5, the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and the fish enthusiast lives in the second house, the person who has a computer must live in the third house.

From clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house. Since the person who has a computer lives in the third house, the cat lover must be the person who has a computer.

From clue 4, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the person who had pizza lives in the second house, the person who had pizza is not the cat lover.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and the person who has a computer lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house.

From clue 9, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and the person who has a computer lives in the third house, the person who had stew must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had stew lives in the fourth house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the fifth house.

From clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a computer lives in the third house, the person who owns horses must live in the first or second house. However, the person who had pizza lives in the second house, so the person who owns horses must live in the first house.

From clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper lives in the second house, the person who has a television must live in the fourth or fifth house. However, the person who ate fried rice lives in the fifth house, so the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Grilled cheese (1)
- House 2: Pizza, Phone, Bird keeper
- House 3: Computer, Cat lover
- House 4: Stew, Television
- House 5: Fried rice, Fish enthusiast

The correct answer is (C) 1."

Now, let's try to place the people in the houses:

- Since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the person eating kiwis, and the person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person wearing boots, the order is: kiwis -> oranges -> boots.
- The person wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other, so they must be in houses 2 and 3, with the pianist in house 3.
- The person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, with the percussionist in house 1.
- The person with a radio lives to the left of the person wearing high heels, so the radio must be in house 1.
- The person eating oranges lives directly to the left of the person with a television, so the television must be in house 3.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: percussionist (running shoes), radio
- House 2: pianist (high heels)
- House 3: person eating oranges, person with a television

Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 3."

2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house. Since the person who drives a truck lives in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at the fruit clues. We know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house, and the person eating a banana does not live in the second house (clue 4). This means the person eating a banana must live in the third house.

Now, we have the following possibilities:
- House 1: swimmer (clue 3), cricketer (from above), and spaghetti (from above)
- House 2: cricketer (from above), spaghetti (from above), and fried rice (from above)
- House 3: fried rice (from above)

Since the cricketer cannot live in the third house (clue 4), the cricketer must live in house 1. This means the swimmer lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and the person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2. The answer is (B) 2."

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 7, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.

From clue 1, the history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the history book buff lives in the second house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.

From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house. However, we already know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, so this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the clues.

From clue 5, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who is eating apples does not live in the third house, and there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. This means the person who is eating apples lives in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct order is:
- House 1: Eating mangos, wearing sandals
- House 2: Eating apples, wearing boots
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, wearing running shoes
- House 4: Eating banana, wearing high heels

The science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house, so the correct answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.
3. The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From clue 3, we know the flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white cannot live in the first house (clue 1), the flutist must live in house 1. The person who likes white must live in house 2.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in house 2, the person who is wearing loafers must live in house 1.

Now, let's analyze the remaining clues:

- The person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1 (since the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2).
- The person who owns a sedan must live in house 2 (since the person who owns an SUV lives in house 1).
- The person who is wearing sandals must live in house 1 (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1).

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other. This means they can be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 3, we know the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house. This eliminates the possibility of the water drinker living in house 1, so they must live in house 2.

From clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the person who drinks water and drives a minivan must live in house 2.

From clue 5, we know the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who drinks water lives in house 2, the person who owns a sedan must live in house 1.

From clue 6, we know the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, the cellist must live in house 1, and the saxophonist must live in house 2.

From clue 7, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. This means the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in either house 1 or 2.

From clue 8, we know the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, the person who is eating apples must live in house 2.

From clue 9, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who is eating apples lives in house 2, the violinist must live in house 3.

So, the order of the houses is: 
- House 1: person who owns a sedan, cellist, saxophonist
- House 2: person who drinks water, person who owns a minivan, person who is eating apples
- House 3: person who has a bouquet of daffodils, person who is eating mangos, person who is drinking root beer

The person who is eating mangos lives in house 3."

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 1, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer. Since the person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other, and the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer, the order is: science fiction book fanatic, history book buff, golfer.

From clue 3, we know the guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils. Since the person with daffodils must be in house 2 (because the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the guitarist is to the right of the person with daffodils), the guitarist must be in house 2.

Now, let's look at the possible combinations of the remaining people:

- The person with daffodils must be in house 2.
- The guitarist is in house 2.
- The science fiction book fanatic and the golfer must be in house 1.
- The history book buff must be in house 1, because the person who had pizza lives next to the history book buff.

Since the person who had pizza lives next to the history book buff, and the history book buff is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 1.

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: history book buff, person who had pizza, golfer
- House 2: science fiction book fanatic, person who had spaghetti, guitarist

The only person left is the percussionist, who must be in house 2, because the guitarist is in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 8, we know the violinist lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 9, we know there are two houses between the person who has a phone and the person who owns horses. Since the violinist lives in the fourth house, the person who owns horses must live in either the third or the fifth house. 

From clue 3, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. If the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house, then the fish enthusiast would live in the sixth house, which is not possible since the bird keeper lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in the third house.

From clue 1, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist. From clue 6, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the percussionist.

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the percussionist, the person who has a television lives to the left of the percussionist.

From clue 4, the flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the flutist lives to the left of the percussionist.

From clue 2, the dog owner does not live in the second house. Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the dog owner must live in either the first or the fifth house. However, the bird keeper lives in the fifth house, so the dog owner must live in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a television lives to the left of the percussionist, the person who has a radio must live to the right of the percussionist.

Now, let's summarize the information we have so far:

- The dog owner lives in the first house.
- The flutist lives to the left of the percussionist.
- The percussionist lives to the right of the flutist.
- The person who has a television lives to the left of the percussionist.
- The person who has a radio lives to the right of the percussionist.
- The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
- The bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

Since the person who owns horses lives in the third house, the person who has a television lives in the second house (because the person who has a television lives to the left of the percussionist, and the percussionist lives to the right of the flutist, who lives to the left of the person who has a television). 

The person who has a radio lives to the right of the percussionist, so the percussionist must live in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person eating apples lives in house 1, and the person with the radio lives in house 2.

2. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with the radio lives in house 2, the violinist must live in house 1.

3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - This confirms that the person with lilies lives in house 1.

4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 2.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: 
  - Person with lilies
  - Violinist
  - Eating apples

- House 2: 
  - Person with a bouquet of roses
  - Eating oranges
  - Has a radio
  - Basketball player

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 1."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given clues to deduce the order of the people and their houses.

From clue 1, we know the tennis player lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

From clue 3, we know the golfer lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives. This means the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the cricketer must live in the first house.

From clue 6, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who had stew lives in the fifth house. However, this contradicts clue 2, which states the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. Therefore, we must re-evaluate the information.

From clue 7, we know the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the soccer player must live in the fourth house. However, this contradicts clue 3, which states the golfer lives in the fourth house. Therefore, we must re-evaluate the information.

Let's re-evaluate the information again. From clue 3, we know the golfer lives in the fourth house. From clue 7, we know the tennis player lives to the left of the soccer player. Since the golfer lives in the fourth house, the tennis player must live in the third house, and the soccer player must live in the fifth house. However, this contradicts clue 2, which states the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. Therefore, we must re-evaluate the information again.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the sixth house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house. From clue 5, we know the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, the person who had pizza must live in the first house. This means the cricketer lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know that the person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2), the person who likes white must live in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 2.

Now, let's analyze the possible positions of the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti. Since they live directly next to each other (clue 3), and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.

We know that the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house (clue 1). Since the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 2.

Now, let's analyze the possible positions of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives directly next to the person who ate spaghetti (clue 4), and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: person who likes white, person who only drinks water, baseball player
- House 2: person who ate spaghetti, person who is wearing running shoes

Since the person who is wearing loafers is not in house 1 or 2, they must live in house 3.

The answer is (B) 1."

1. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover cannot live in house 2. From clue 4, we know the person eating oranges cannot live in house 2 either. This means the root beer lover and the person eating oranges must live in either house 1 or house 3.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos cannot live in house 1 (because the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos), the person eating mangos must live in house 3.

Now, let's analyze the possible positions for the root beer lover and the person eating oranges:

- If the root beer lover lives in house 1, the person eating oranges must live in house 3, but this would mean the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos, which is not possible (since the person eating oranges lives in house 3). So, this is not a valid option.
- If the root beer lover lives in house 3, the person eating oranges must live in house 1, and the coffee drinker must live in house 2. This is a valid option.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3."

From clue 4, we know the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.

Now, we know the order of houses is: 
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: ? (Fried rice)

From clue 1, we know the person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. This means the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

So, the order of houses is: 
- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Fried rice

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house. The answer is (A) 2."

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives in the fifth house. Since the cat lover can't live in the fifth house (clue 2), the cat lover must live in the fourth house.

Since the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house, the person wearing loafers must live in the third house, which is already occupied by the dog owner. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 6. The person wearing running shoes and the bird keeper live directly next to each other, but the bird keeper can't live in the third house. This means the person wearing running shoes must live in the second house, and the bird keeper must live in the fourth house.

From clue 11, the person with a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner lives in the third house, the person with a vase of tulips must live in either the first or second house.

Since the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house, which is already occupied by the dog owner. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 11. The person with a vase of tulips lives to the left of the dog owner, and the person who likes milk must live in the third house. This means the person with a vase of tulips must live in the first house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

1. Person with a vase of tulips
2. Person wearing running shoes
3. Dog owner
4. Bird keeper
5. Root beer lover
6. Person with a bouquet of lilies
7. Person with a bouquet of daffodils
8. Person with a carnations arrangement

From clue 5, the coffee drinker and the person with a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. Since the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the sixth house, the coffee drinker and the person with a rose bouquet must live in the fifth or seventh house. However, the root beer lover lives in the fifth house, so the coffee drinker and the person with a rose bouquet must live in the seventh house.

From clue 7, there is one house between where the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the person with a bouquet of lilies lives. Since the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the sixth house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person with a bouquet of lilies lives. Since the root beer lover lives in the fifth house, the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the sixth house.

From clue 9, the person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper lives in the fourth house, the person with a carnations arrangement must live in the third house, but the dog owner lives in the third house. This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 10. The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house, the person wearing loafers must live in the fourth house, and the bird keeper must live in the third house. This means the person with a carnations arrangement must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

1. Person with a vase of tulips
2. Person with a carnations arrangement
3. Bird keeper
4. Person wearing loafers
5. Root beer lover
6. Person with a bouquet of lilies
7. Person with a bouquet of daffodils

We still need to determine the sport of the person in house 1 and the book type of the person in house 2.

From clue 6, the flutist lives to the right of the person who wears boots. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the boots must be in the third house.

From clue 7, the flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the flutist must be in the first house, but we already know the cellist is in the first house. This means the flutist must be in the third house.

From clue 8, the basketball player lives to the right of the person who wears running shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. Since the baseball player also lives in the second house (clue 2), the person who drives a convertible must be the baseball player.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house. Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must live in the first house.

The only person left is the cricketer, who must live in the first house. The cricketer must be eating grapes, and the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

Now, we know the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house, and the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. The person who eats mangos must live in the second house.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in house 3, the person who is eating apples must be in house 1, and the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes blue is in house 2, and the person who is eating kiwis is in house 3, the person who likes white must be in house 3. However, this would mean the person who likes green is in house 1, which contradicts the fact that the person who is eating apples is in house 1. 

However, re-examining clue 1, we realize that the person who likes white can be in house 1, and the person who likes green can be in house 2. This would mean the person who likes blue is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis is in house 1, and the person who is eating oranges is in house 2.

From clue 3, we know the gameboy owner lives to the left of the mystery book reader. 

From clue 2, we know the soccer player lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Since the gameboy owner lives to the left of the mystery book reader, the soccer player must live to the left of the gameboy owner.

Now, let's combine this information with clue 1. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the soccer player lives to the left of the mystery book reader, and the gameboy owner lives to the left of the mystery book reader, the rose bouquet owner must live to the left of the soccer player. 

So, the order of the houses is: 
- Gameboy owner (left)

- Root beer lover (right)

The only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy owner
- House 2: Soccer player

Combining all the information, we can conclude that the person who is eating oranges lives in the second house, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, the person who is eating mangos lives in the third house, the swimmer lives in the first house, the golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live in the fourth house, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fifth house, the tennis player lives in the sixth house, and the mystery book reader lives in the seventh house.

The only house left is the third house, which must be occupied by the person who likes yellow, the person who is eating bananas, or the person who likes white. However, the person who likes yellow cannot live in the third house because the cricketer lives to the left of the person who likes yellow (clue 3). The person who is eating bananas cannot live in the third house because the person who is eating mangos lives in the third house (clue 5). Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the third house.

The person who likes white lives in the third house, and the history book buff lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   This means the cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   Since the cellist lives in house 1, the dog owner must live in house 2.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.

Since the person with the radio lives in house 4, the person with the phone must live in house 3. However, we already know the person with the gameboy lives in house 3, so the person with the phone must be the person with the gameboy. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Let's re-evaluate clue 3. If the person with the phone lives directly left of the person with the SUV, and the person with the radio lives in house 4, then the person with the phone must live in house 2. This means the person with the SUV lives in house 3.

Now, let's re-evaluate the other clues. From clue 5, we know the person with the convertible does not live in the third house. From clue 6, we know the person with the computer does not live in the first house. Since the person with the SUV lives in house 3, the person with the convertible must live in house 1, and the person with the computer must live in house 2.

So, the correct order is:
- House 1: person with the minivan (clue 2)
- House 2: person with the computer (clue 6)
- House 3: person with the SUV (clue 3)
- House 4: person with the radio (clue 4)

From clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other, so the order is:
1. Tea drinker
2. White drinker
3. Water drinker
4. ? (spaghetti eater or coffee drinker)

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the saxophonist does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house, the saxophonist must live in the first, second, or fourth house. However, the person who likes white lives in the second house, so the saxophonist must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be the person who likes white, but we already know the person who likes white lives in the second house, so this is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by realizing that the person who ate spaghetti must be the person who likes yellow, and the person who likes white lives in the fifth house.

From clue 12, we know the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house, the person who had pizza must live in the sixth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- The person who likes red (pianist) lives in the third house.
- The person who likes white lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the fifth house.
- The person who had pizza lives in the sixth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.
- The percussionist lives in the second house.
- The cellist lives in the fourth house.

The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, but we know the pianist (who likes red) lives in the third house. However, we can see that the person who ate fried rice must be the person who likes green, and the person who likes red is the pianist."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.

Now, let's start from the left end. We know the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew (clue 5). We also know the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (clue 2). So, the order is: running shoes, stew, spaghetti.

We also know the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other (clue 6). Since the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house (clue 7), the only possible position for the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water is the second and third house. However, the tea drinker lives in the third house (clue 1), so the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

Now, we have the order: running shoes, ?, ?, high heels, water, ?, ?, root beer lover.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live in the second house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live in the second house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Now, we have the order: grilled cheese, running shoes, ?, high heels, water, ?, ?, root beer lover.

From clue 2, we know the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew (clue 5), the person who had stew must live in the first house.

The only remaining person is the tea drinker, who lives in the third house (clue 1). The only remaining person is the person who ate spaghetti, who must live in the fourth house.

Now, we have the order: grilled cheese, running shoes, stew, ?, high heels, water, spaghetti, root beer lover.

The only remaining person is the person who is wearing boots, who must live in the second house.

The correct order is: grilled cheese, boots, running shoes, tea, high heels, water, spaghetti, root beer lover.

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house."

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover does not live in the first house. Since the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 9, we know the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the root beer lover cannot live in the first house, the root beer lover must live in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who has a computer lives in the third house, the person who had stew must live in the first or second house.

From clue 13, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first or second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the person who has a computer lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. There are only two houses, so the person who ate fried rice must live in house 2.

Since the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2, and the person who ate pizza lives in house 1, we can conclude that the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes white lives in the first house. Since the pianist lives in the first house, the person who likes white must be the pianist. This means the person who likes blue lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who owns horses must live in the first house. But we already know the pianist lives in the first house, so the person who owns horses must be the pianist. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

Let's re-evaluate the information. Since the pianist lives in the first house, the person who likes white must be the pianist. This means the person who likes blue lives in the second house. The person who owns horses must live in the second house, because the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses. The root beer lover must live in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: root beer lover, pianist (who likes white)
- House 2: dog owner, person who likes blue

The order of the houses from left to right is: 
- Fried rice
- Fantasy book enthusiast
- Science fiction book fanatic

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 9, we know the person wearing loafers lives in the first house.

From clue 11, we know the swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house (clue 5), the person who likes green must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing boots does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing boots must live in either the first or the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes green. If the person who likes green lives in the first house, then the person who likes blue must live in the third house, but this is already occupied by the tennis player (clue 8).

From clue 1, we know the person wearing boots does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing boots must live in the fourth house.

Since the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio (clue 10), and the person who has a radio cannot live in the second house (clue 6), the person who has a phone must live in the first house. This means the person who has a gameboy must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house, which is already occupied by the tennis player (clue 8). This is a contradiction. However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 3. The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other, but they don't necessarily have to be next to each other in the same house. This means the person who likes yellow can live in the third house, and the person who has a gameboy can live in the fourth house.

From clue 8, we know the tennis player lives in the third house. From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the third house. However, this is occupied by the tennis player (clue 8). This is a contradiction. We can resolve this by re-examining clue 4. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, but they don't necessarily have to be next to each other in the same house. This means the cricketer can live in the second house, and the person who is wearing sandals can live in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the tennis player lives in the third house. From clue 4, we know the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the tennis player lives in the third house, the cricketer must live in the second house.

The order of the houses is as follows:
- 1st house: person wearing loafers, person with a phone

3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. 

From clue 2, we know the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the romance book lover must live in the second house, and the history book buff must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover lives in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

However, we already know the history book buff lives in the third house. This means the person who ate fried rice must be the history book buff, which contradicts clue 3. 

Let's re-evaluate the clues. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the romance book lover lives in the second house, and the history book buff lives in the third house, we can conclude that the person who ate pizza must live in the first house. 

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the person who likes green must live in the second house. 

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must live in the third house.

So, the order of the houses is:
- House 1: person who likes yellow (pizza)
- House 2: person who likes green (romance book lover)
- House 3: person who likes blue (history book buff)

The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, which is option (A) 1."

From clue 3, we know the person with a computer and a vase of tulips live next to each other. Since they can't be in the second house (because the golfer doesn't live there), they must be in either the first or the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television. This means the person with a radio can't be in the first house (because the person with a computer and a vase of tulips would be to the left of the person with a television). So, the person with a radio must be in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 4. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. Since the person with a radio is in the third house, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the second house.

We know the golfer doesn't live in the second house (clue 2), so the golfer must live in the first house. The person with a computer and a vase of tulips must live in the third house, and the person with a radio lives in the third house as well. This means the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house, and the golfer lives in the first house.

So, the order of the houses is: 
- Golfer (1)
- Rose bouquet (2)
- Computer and tulips (3)
- Radio (4)

The person who has a computer lives in house 3."

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing loafers lives in the second house. From clue 4, the person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing loafers, so the person wearing boots must live in the first house.

From clue 1, the person with the television lives in the fourth house. Clue 3 states the person with the phone does not live in the second house, so the person with the phone must live in either the first, third, or fourth house. Since the person with the television lives in the fourth house, the person with the phone must live in the first or third house.

Now, let's look at clue 5. The person with the radio lives two houses away from the person with the sandals. Since the person with the boots lives in the first house and the person with the loafers lives in the second house, the person with the sandals must live in the third house. This is because there are two houses between the person with the radio and the person with the sandals.

So, the order of the houses is:
- Boots (1st house)
- Radio (2nd house)
- Sandals (3rd house)
- Television (4th house)

The person with the gameboy must live in the remaining house, which is the 1st house."

4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes milk does not live in the first house, so the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the coffee drinker does not live in the first house, so the coffee drinker must live in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, which means the person wearing running shoes is the coffee drinker.

Now we have the following information:
- The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
- The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
- The person wearing running shoes is the coffee drinker.

Since the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, and the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house, the person wearing loafers must live in the first house.

The person who likes milk does not live in the first house (clue 3), so the person who likes milk must live in the second house. However, we already know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, so the person who likes milk must be the person wearing high heels.

Now we have the following information:
- The person wearing high heels lives in the second house (and likes milk).
- The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house (and is the coffee drinker).
- The person wearing loafers lives in the first house.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From the first clue, we know the person wearing loafers cannot live in house 1. This means the person wearing loafers must live in house 2.

From the second clue, we know the mystery book reader cannot live in house 2. Since the person wearing loafers lives in house 2, the mystery book reader must live in house 1.

Now, we know:
- The person wearing loafers lives in house 2.
- The mystery book reader lives in house 1.

Since the person wearing high heels is not mentioned, we can conclude that the person wearing high heels must be the history book buff, as the mystery book reader is already assigned to house 1.

Therefore, the person wearing loafers lives in house 2."

From clue 5, we know the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is eating kiwis, the person who is eating a banana lives in the second house.

From clue 10, we know the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the second house, the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.

However, we already know the person who likes yellow is eating kiwis in the first house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must be the person who likes blue.

From clue 12, we know the person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the swimmer must live in the first house. However, we already know the person who likes yellow is eating kiwis in the first house. Therefore, the swimmer must be the person who likes white.

From clue 1, we know the cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who likes yellow is eating kiwis, the person who is eating oranges must live in the fourth house.

From clue 9, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating oranges must be the person who drives a truck.

From clue 11, we know the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white is the swimmer, the person who drives a minivan must live in the second house. However, we already know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. Therefore, the person who drives a minivan must be the person who likes green.

From clue 3, we know the soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who drives a truck lives in the fourth house, the soccer player must live in the first, second, or third house. However, we already know the person who likes yellow is eating kiwis in the first house, the person who likes blue lives in the second house, and the person who drives a minivan lives in the second house. Therefore, the soccer player must live in the third house.

From clue 14, we know there is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the swimmer lives in the first house and the cricketer lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in the second house.

Now we have the following arrangement:

- House 1: Person who likes yellow (eating kiwis), soccer player
- House 2: Person who likes blue (owning an SUV), person who likes green (driving a minivan), person who is eating a banana
- House 3: Person who likes white (swimmer), person who owns an SUV
- House 4: Person who likes orange (driving a truck), person who likes mango (driving a convertible), cricketer

- Grilled cheese (1st house)
- Stew (2nd house)
- Romance book lover (3rd house)

However, re-examining the clues, we realize that the fantasy book enthusiast can live in the first house, and the person who had stew lives in the second house.

The correct order is: 
- Fantasy book enthusiast (1st house)
- Stew (2nd house)
- Romance book lover (3rd house)

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

From clue 3, we know that the swimmer cannot live in the first house (since the history book buff lives there) or the third house (since there needs to be one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic). This means the swimmer must live in the second house.

However, we already know the golfer lives in the second house. Therefore, the swimmer cannot live in the second house. 

Considering the above, the only possible position for the swimmer is the third house."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given clues and deduce the correct order of the people.

From clue 1, we know the swimmer lives directly left of the person eating apples. Since the swimmer can't be in the first house (because the person eating apples can't be in the last house), the swimmer must be in the second house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer. So, the romance book lover must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the bird keeper lives in the third house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who ate fried rice must be in either the first or the second house. However, since the swimmer is in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house.

From clue 5, the cat lover lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the history book buff must be in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house, the soccer player must be in the third house.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the third house, which is already occupied by the soccer player. This means the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

From clue 8, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. This means the person who likes white must live in either the first, third, or fifth house.

Now, let's combine all the information:

- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or fifth house.
- The person who likes green does not live in the second house, so the person who likes green must live in the first or fifth house.
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
- The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew. This means the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who likes red must live in the second house.

So, the order of the houses is: 
- The person who likes blue lives in the first house.
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- The person who had stew lives in the third house.
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
- The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.

The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (E) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in the second house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. 

From clue 3, we know the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. 

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist lives in the second house, the person who likes yellow must live in either the first or the third house. 

Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes yellow must live in the first house. 

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
- Yellow (1st house)
- Percussionist (2nd house)
- Red (3rd house)

From clue 1, the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the violinist cannot live in the first house (because the person who likes yellow lives there), the violinist must live in the third house. 

However, this would mean the basketball player lives in the second house, which is not possible because the percussionist lives in the second house. 

So, let's re-examine the clues. 

From clue 3, the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. 

From clue 1, the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. 

Since the violinist cannot live in the third house (because the person who likes red lives there), the violinist must live in the second house. 

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
- Yellow (1st house)
- Violinist (2nd house)
- Red (3rd house)

From clue 3, the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. Since the violinist lives in the second house, the basketball player must live in the third house. 

However, this would mean the tennis player lives in the second house, which is not possible because the percussionist lives in the second house. 

So, let's re-examine the clues again. 

From clue 3, the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. 

From clue 1, the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. 

Since the violinist cannot live in the third house (because the person who likes red lives there), the violinist must live in the second house. 

Now, we have the following arrangement: 
- Yellow (1st house)
- Violinist (2nd house)
- ? (3rd house)

From clue 2, the person who likes red lives in the third house. 

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. 

From clue 5, the percussionist lives in the second house. 

From clue 3, the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. 

Since the violinist lives in the second house, the basketball player must live in the third house. 

So, the correct arrangement is: 
- Yellow (1st house)
- Violinist (2nd house)
- Basketball (3rd house)

The answer is (B) 3."

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives to the right of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house, the person with the carnations arrangement must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly to the left of the person with the vase of tulips. Since the person with the carnations arrangement lives in the first house, the romance book lover must live in the second house, and the person with the vase of tulips must live in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast (carnations arrangement)
- House 2: Romance book lover (rose bouquet)
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic (vase of tulips)

From clue 4, the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house, which is correct.

The only house left is the fourth house, which must be the person with the lilies bouquet.

The answer is (C) 4."
"From the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
3. The person wearing sandals cannot be in house 1, as the science fiction book fanatic lives there.

So, the person wearing sandals must be in house 2.

Now, we know the order of the houses is: 
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Person wearing sandals

Since the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, the coffee drinker must be in house 1.

Now, we know the order of the houses is: 
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing sandals

The only remaining characteristic is the favorite drink, which is water. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be the water drinker.

Now, we know the order of the houses is: 
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Water drinker (person wearing sandals)

The only remaining characteristic is the favorite book, which is romance. Therefore, the romance book lover must live in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"From the given clues, we know:
- The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

Since the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio, the percussionist must live in house 1.

Now, we know the piano player lives in house 2 and the percussionist lives in house 1. 

Since the person who has a radio lives in house 2, and the piano player lives in house 2, the person who has a phone must live in house 1.

So, the answer is (A) 1."

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house (clue 2), the fantasy book enthusiast must be the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who ate fried rice) lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

Now, we know the order of the houses is: 
- Fantasy book enthusiast (fried rice) - 2nd house
- Spaghetti - 1st house
- Science fiction book fanatic - 3rd house

From clue 2, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who ate fried rice) lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

The person who ate grilled cheese must be the science fiction book fanatic, as the other two people have already been assigned. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this, let's analyze the given information:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.
2. There are only two houses, so the person with the carnations arrangement must live in house 1, as the person with the tulips (house 2) cannot be to the left of the dog owner.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   This means the person who is wearing high heels cannot be in house 1, because the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.

2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1, because the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1.

3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels cannot be in house 1, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: person wearing high heels, eating grapes, and drinking milk
- House 2: person wearing sandals, eating kiwis, and drinking water

The person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know that the person wearing sandals and the person eating grapes live next to each other. Since they live in houses 1 and 2, and the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, the order is: 

- House 1: person wearing high heels, person eating grapes
- House 2: person wearing sandals, person eating kiwis

Now, let's analyze the remaining clues. Clue 3 states that the tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television. Since the person eating grapes is wearing high heels, the person eating kiwis must be wearing sandals. The person eating kiwis lives in house 2, and the person wearing high heels lives in house 1. 

The only remaining option is that the person drinking tea lives in house 1, and the person with a television lives in house 2. 

Therefore, the person eating kiwis lives in house 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   This means the water drinker can be in house 2 or 3.

2. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   This means the guitarist cannot be in house 1 (because there's no house between the violinist and the guitarist), and the guitarist cannot be in house 3 (because the violinist is not in house 3, and there's no house between the violinist and the guitarist).

3. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   This means the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. The violinist does not live in the third house.
   This means the violinist can be in house 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The tea drinker lives in house 1.
- The violinist can be in house 1 or 2.
- The water drinker lives to the right of the cellist.
- The guitarist lives two houses to the right of the violinist.

If the violinist is in house 1, the order would be: tea drinker (house 1), violinist (house 1), water drinker (house 2), cellist (house 3), and guitarist (house 4). However, this contradicts the condition that there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist.

If the violinist is in house 2, the order would be: tea drinker (house 1), violinist (house 2), cellist (house 3), water drinker (house 4), and guitarist (house 5). This satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 5, but the answer choices only go up to 3. However, we can deduce that the guitarist lives in house 5 is not an option, but we can deduce the guitarist lives in house 3 is not correct, and the guitarist lives in house 2 is not correct. The only option left is house 1 is taken by the tea drinker, and house 3 is taken by the cellist. Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 2 is not correct, and the only option left is house 1 is taken by the tea drinker, and house 3 is taken by the cellist. The only option left is house 2 is taken by the water drinker, and the only option left is house 3 is taken by the cellist. The only option left is house 1 is taken by the tea drinker, and the only option left is house 2 is taken by the water drinker, and the only option left is house 3 is taken by the cellist."
"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. However, we already know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house. This means the person who likes milk must be the person wearing high heels.

From clue 2, we know the person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. This means the person wearing running shoes can live in either the second, third, fourth, or fifth house.

From clue 5, we know there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. This means the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers must live in the second and fourth houses, or the third and fifth houses.

From clue 6, we know the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, the person wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

Now we have the following information:
- The person wearing sandals lives in the third house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person wearing boots lives in the fifth house.

From clue 4, we know the tea drinker lives in the fifth house. However, we already know the person wearing boots lives in the fifth house. This means the tea drinker must be the person wearing loafers.

Now we have the following information:
- The person wearing sandals lives in the third house.
- The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person wearing boots lives in the fifth house.
- The tea drinker lives in the fifth house, but we know the person wearing boots lives in the fifth house, so the tea drinker must be the person wearing loafers.

We can now deduce the following:
- The person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
- The person wearing high heels lives in the first house.

The final answer is C."

So, the person with a radio must live in the third house.

Now, let's place the person with a gameboy and the person with a computer. Since the person with a computer does not live in the fourth house, the person with a computer must live in the second house, and the person with a gameboy must live in the third house.

Now, let's place the person with fried rice. Since the person with fried rice lives in the fifth house, and there is one house between the person with a gameboy and the person with fried rice, the person with fried rice must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the person with spaghetti. Since the person with grilled cheese lives directly to the left of the person with spaghetti, the person with spaghetti must live in the fifth house.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other. Since they can't be in the same house (clue 1), they must be in houses 1 and 2, in that order. 

Now, let's analyze the possible positions of the cellist and the mystery book reader. Clue 1 states that the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. If the cellist lives in house 1, the mystery book reader must live in house 2. If the cellist lives in house 2, the mystery book reader must live in house 1.

However, we also know that the history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover (clue 2). If the cellist lives in house 1, the history book buff must live in house 1, which means the cat lover must live in house 2. But this would mean the root beer lover and the guitarist live in house 2, which contradicts clue 3.

Therefore, the cellist must live in house 2, and the mystery book reader must live in house 1.

Now, we know the order of the houses is: 
- House 1: mystery book reader
- House 2: cellist
- House 1: history book buff
- House 2: root beer lover
- House 1: cat lover

Since the cat lover lives in house 1, the person who owns horses must live in house 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

From clue 1, we know the bird keeper lives to the left of the person with the carnations arrangement. 

From clue 2, we know the dog owner cannot live in the second house. This means the dog owner can only live in either the first or the third house.

From clue 3, we know the person with the vase of tulips lives to the right of the dog owner. If the dog owner lives in the first house, then the person with the vase of tulips must live in the third house. However, this would mean the person with the carnations arrangement lives in the second house, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, the dog owner cannot live in the first house.

So, the dog owner must live in the third house. 

Now, the person with the vase of tulips must live in the second house, as it is to the right of the dog owner. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."

Since the person with a vase of tulips is in the third house, the person wearing loafers must be in the first or fourth house.

From clue 3, we know there is one house between where the person wearing boots lives and where the person eating kiwis lives. Since the person wearing loafers is in the fourth house, the person eating kiwis must be in the third house.

From clue 9, we know the person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house. Since the person eating kiwis is in the third house, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the first or second house. However, the person wearing loafers is in the fourth house, and the person with a vase of tulips is in the third house, so the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the first house.

From clue 11, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person eating a banana. Since the person with a bouquet of lilies is in the first house, the person eating a banana must be in the second house.

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
3. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. 

From clue 3, since the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff, and the mystery book reader is in the first house, the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 1, the romance book lover does not live in the third house, and since the history book buff lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the first or second house.

From clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house, and since the history book buff lives in the third house, the person who owns horses must live in either the first or second house.

Combining the information, we have:
- Mystery book reader in the first house
- Bird keeper in the second house
- History book buff in the third house
- Person who owns horses in the first or second house

Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the first house. 

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in the second house. 

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating apples lives to the left of the person drinking water. Since the coffee drinker is in the second house, the person eating apples must be in the first house.

From clue 3, the person eating mangos does not live in the first house, so the person eating mangos must live in the third or fourth house.

From clue 4, the person eating mangos does not live in the third house, so the person eating mangos must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person eating apples lives to the left of the tea drinker. Since the person eating apples is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the third house.

From clue 6, the person eating kiwis does not live in the third house, so the person eating kiwis must live in the second or fourth house. However, the coffee drinker is in the second house, so the person eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Apple drinker
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Kiwi drinker

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means that the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

2. The saxophonist and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - Since the saxophonist lives in house 1, the golfer must live in house 2.

3. The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person eating grapes lives in house 1 or 2, and the golfer lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.

4. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This confirms that the saxophonist lives in house 1.

5. The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - Since the golfer lives in house 2, the romance book lover must live in house 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in the first house. Clue 3 also tells us that the person with boots lives in the first house. Since the person with boots is already in the first house, we can conclude that the person with boots is the one with daffodils.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person with lilies does not live in the second house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person with boots and daffodils, the person with lilies must live in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person with high heels does not live in the second house. This means the person with high heels must live in either the first or the third house. However, we already know the first house is occupied by the person with boots and daffodils. Therefore, the person with high heels must live in the third house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: boots and daffodils
- House 2: unknown
- House 3: high heels and lilies

Since the person with high heels lives in the third house, the correct answer is (B) 3."

"To solve this problem, we will analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 2, we know the tea drinker lives in the first house.

From clue 3, the tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the tea drinker is in the first house, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house, which is already occupied by the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and they live in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.

From clue 6, there are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. This means the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house, and the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fourth house.

From clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This confirms the arrangement of the third and fourth houses.

From clue 9, the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in the first house (because the tea drinker is there), they must be in the fourth house. The person who likes red must be in the fifth house.

From clue 10, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, the person who likes white must be in the second house.

From clue 11, the root beer lover does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, the root beer lover must be in the first house.

From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who had stew lives. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house, the person who had stew must be in the third house.

3. Person who has a bouquet of daffodils (coffee drinker) - 3rd house
4. Person who likes yellow (stew) - 4th house

The person who likes green lives in the 4th house."

Since the person who drives a truck does not live in the second house (clue 1), the person who drives a truck must live in the fourth house. The person who drives a sedan lives to the left of the person who drives a truck (clue 3), so the person who drives a sedan must live in the second house.

We need to re-evaluate the information.

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the second house. The person who drives a sedan lives in the second house, so the person who drives a sedan must be the person who had stew.

From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the cat lover. Since the person who drives a sedan lives in the second house, the cat lover must live in the third house. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house (clue 7). However, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the information.

From clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan.

The person who has a bouquet of tulips lives in the first house (clue 12), and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house (clue 13).

"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

"To solve this problem, we can analyze the given clues step by step.

From clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the tea drinker lives in the third house, the person eating kiwis must live in the second house, and the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. This confirms our previous conclusion.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house. This confirms our previous conclusion.

From clue 6, we know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the third house. However, we know the tea drinker lives in the third house, so the person who likes green must be the tea drinker.

From clue 7, we know the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. This confirms our previous conclusion.

From clue 8, we know the person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house. Since the tea drinker lives in the third house, the person eating oranges must live in either the first or second house. However, we know the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, so the person eating oranges must live in the first house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person eating oranges, person wearing running shoes, person eating apples, person who likes milk
- House 2: person eating kiwis, person wearing boots, person who likes green
- House 3: person who likes blue, person wearing high heels, person who likes white, person who has a vase of tulips

The person who is eating apples lives in the first house."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. From clue 1, the history book buff lives directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff lives in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who has a television lives directly to the right of the mystery book reader. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television lives in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who has a computer lives to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person with the television lives in the third house, the person with the phone must live in the second house (because the history book buff lives in the second house). The person with the computer must live in the third house, but we already know that the third house is occupied by the person with the television. This means the person with the computer must live in the second house, but that would mean the history book buff and the person with the phone are in the same house, which contradicts clue 3. 

However, re-examining the clues, we can see that the person with the phone must be in the first house, because the mystery book reader lives in the first house and the person with the television lives in the third house. The person with the computer must live in the second house, and the history book buff lives in the second house. This means the person with the science fiction book lives in the third house, which is the only house left.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

A person with St. Vitus's Dance, also known as Chorea, is a neurological disorder that affects movement. It is characterized by involuntary, unpredictable movements, which can be quite uncoordinated and uncontrolled. 

Given the nature of this condition, it is highly unlikely that a person with St. Vitus's Dance would be able to perform the precise, elegant movements required in ballet. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) No."
"The answer is (A) No.

Pig Latin is a playful language game where words are translated by moving the first consonant (or consonant cluster) to the end of the word and adding the sound ""ay"" to the end. For example, ""hello"" becomes ""ellohay"".

Pigs, being animals, do not possess the cognitive abilities to understand or use language in the same way humans do. However, if we were to imagine a pig trying to use Pig Latin, it's not impossible. A pig could, in theory, be taught to associate sounds and words with meanings and use a simplified version of Pig Latin. So, the answer is no, it's not impossible for pigs to use Pig Latin, but it would likely be a very different and creative interpretation of the language."

"The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany, and the main venue was the Olympic Stadium, which had a seating capacity of approximately 100,000 spectators. 

A Super Bowl, on the other hand, is the championship game of the National Football League (NFL) in the United States, and its seating capacity can vary greatly depending on the stadium. However, the largest Super Bowl stadium, Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, has a seating capacity of around 71,000.

Considering the seating capacity of the Olympic Stadium in 1936, it is unlikely that it would be able to accommodate a Super Bowl crowd. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Yes"

Martin Luther was a monk and a theologian who lived from 1483 to 1546. He is famous for his 95 Theses, which he nailed to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany in 1517.

If Martin Luther nailed one thesis a day, it would take him approximately 183 days to complete all 95 theses. Since 183 is less than 6 months, he would not run out of theses in half a year.

So, the correct answer is (B) No."

Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, which creates a strong greenhouse effect, resulting in extremely high surface temperatures (up to 462°C or 863°F). This makes it one of the hottest planets in the solar system. Additionally, the atmosphere is dense and pressurized, which would make it difficult for a snowboarder to move around, and the extreme heat would likely cause any snowboard to melt instantly."

Rich and Morty is a popular animated series that deals with mature themes, including substance abuse and addiction. The show's portrayal of a dysfunctional family, particularly the father Rick's struggles with addiction, may be triggering for some children of alcoholics. The show's dark humor, complex characters, and mature themes may be too intense for younger viewers, and some scenes may evoke feelings of anxiety, guilt, or shame in children who have experienced similar situations in their own families."
"The correct answer is (A) No.

Simon Cowell is a music executive and television personality, not a U.S. citizen or a qualified candidate for the position of Supreme Court judge. The U.S. Constitution sets out specific eligibility requirements for Supreme Court justices, which include being a U.S. citizen for at least 9 years, being a resident of the United States for at least 9 years, and meeting certain other qualifications. Simon Cowell does not meet these requirements, so he is not eligible to vote for the next Supreme Court judge, nor is he eligible to be appointed to the position himself."

"To answer this question, let's consider the characteristics and abilities of both Apollo and D'Artagnan.

Apollo, in Greek mythology, is the god of the sun, music, poetry, prophecy, and healing. He is often depicted as a powerful and radiant being with incredible abilities, such as playing the lyre and controlling the sun.

D'Artagnan, on the other hand, is a fictional character from the Three Musketeers, known for his bravery, agility, and swordsmanship. He is a skilled swordsman and a member of the Musketeers of the Guard.

Given these characteristics, it's difficult to say who would emerge victorious in a hypothetical battle between the two. However, if I had to make an educated guess, I would say that Apollo's powers might give him an edge over D'Artagnan.

Apollo's abilities as a god could potentially allow him to:

* Control the sun, which could blind or disorient D'Artagnan
* Heal himself or others, making him more resilient in battle
* Summon powerful forces of nature, such as lightning or earthquakes, to aid him in combat

D'Artagnan, on the other hand, relies on his human skills and abilities, which might not be enough to counter Apollo's divine powers.

So, in a hypothetical battle between the two, I would say that Apollo's powers might give him the upper hand, and he could potentially defeat D'Artagnan.

But, of course, this is all just speculation and for the sake of fun!"
"The condition that killed Bob Marley was skin cancer, specifically acral lentiginous melanoma, which is a type of skin cancer that appears on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

(A) No"
"The correct answer is (B) No.

The French Defense is a solid and flexible opening that can lead to a number of different pawn structures and transpositions, but it is not typically considered to be a reliable defense against a four-move checkmate. In fact, the French Defense is often considered to be a pawn structure that can be vulnerable to attacks, particularly if Black fails to properly develop their pieces and control the center of the board.

In general, a four-move checkmate is extremely rare, and it's usually the result of a combination of factors, including a weak pawn structure, poor piece development, and a lack of coordination between pieces. The French Defense can be a challenging opening to play, but it is not inherently vulnerable to four-move checkmate."
"(B) No

Chlorine is a disinfectant commonly used to purify water. However, its effectiveness decreases over time. Drinking water that is a week old may not be safe, as the chlorine levels may have dropped below the recommended safe limits. It's best to check the water quality or use a water filter to ensure the water is safe to drink."
"A dichromat is a person with dichromatosis, a condition where they have difficulty perceiving certain colors, particularly reds and greens. 

Given that a dichromat has trouble distinguishing between red and green, it's likely they would also struggle to distinguish between other colors that are similar in hue, such as neon signs, which often display bright, vibrant colors like red, green, and blue.

Therefore, a dichromat probably would not be able to easily distinguish chlorine gas (which is colorless) from neon gas (which is also colorless)."

"I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can provide information about sea turtles.

Sea turtles are generally resilient creatures, and they can adapt to various environments, including quarantine situations. In a controlled environment, such as a quarantine facility, sea turtles can receive proper care and nutrition, which can help them thrive.

However, the enjoyment of life is subjective and can vary depending on individual circumstances. Sea turtles in quarantine may not be able to engage in their natural behaviors, such as swimming or foraging, which could be a source of stress or boredom.

So, while sea turtles can survive and even recover in quarantine, it's difficult to say whether they are ""enjoying"" life in this context."

The Easter Bunny is a symbol of Easter, a holiday that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

The Confederate States of America, which seceded from the United States in 1861, did not speak Old English. Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was the earliest form of the English language spoken in England from the 5th to the 11th centuries. It is the ancestor of Modern English.

The people who lived in the Confederate States during the American Civil War spoke a dialect of English that was influenced by various languages, including Scottish, Irish, Welsh, and African languages, as well as English. This dialect is often referred to as Southern American English or Southern dialect.

The term ""Confederate"" refers to the Confederacy, not the language spoken by the people."

The Jackson 5 was a family band consisting of five brothers: Michael, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon Jackson. They were one of the most popular and influential musical groups of the 1970s.

The Isley Brothers, on the other hand, were a family band consisting of three brothers: O'Kelly, Rudolph, and Ronald Isley. They were also a highly influential group, known for their soul and R&B music.

While both groups were successful and had a significant impact on the music industry, The Isley Brothers had a longer career and more chart-topping hits, including ""It's Your Thing,"" ""That Lady,"" and ""Who's That Lady (I Know It's You)."" The Jackson 5, however, had a more significant impact on pop music, with hits like ""I Want You Back,"" ""ABC,"" and ""The Love You Save."""

3. Low body weight: Being underweight can put additional stress on bones, making them more prone to fractures.
4. Reduced muscle mass: Muscle plays a crucial role in bone health, and individuals with anorexia nervosa often have low muscle mass, which can further weaken bones.

As a result, people with anorexia nervosa are at a higher risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures, including osteoporotic compression fractures, which can occur with minimal trauma."

"I'd say the answer is (B) No.

Goblin sharks are deep-sea creatures with a unique body shape and physiology that's adapted for their aquatic environment. They have a slender, elongated body, a small head, and a long, pointed snout. Even if they had limbs, their skeletal structure and muscle composition would likely be very different from those of humans or other land-dwelling animals. Their limbs would need to be adapted for swimming and maneuverability in the water, not for supporting their body weight on land.

Additionally, goblin sharks are relatively small, with adults reaching a maximum length of about 18 inches (45 cm). Even if they had limbs, they would likely be too small and lightweight to generate enough force to propel themselves on a bike.

So, while it's an interesting thought experiment, I think it's unlikely that a goblin shark could ride a bike, even if it had limbs."
"The correct answer is (B) Yes.

Although Kurt Cobain's death in 1994 marked the end of the grunge movement, his music genre has continued to influence and evolve. Grunge's impact can be seen in various forms of music, such as alternative rock, indie rock, and even pop music.

However, her son James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) survived and went on to become King of England and Scotland, uniting the crowns under a single monarch. He was the ancestor of the Stuart dynasty, which included famous monarchs such as Charles I, Charles II, James II, and Anne."
"It's difficult to say with certainty, but I can provide some context.

In the story ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" by Lewis Carroll, the main character Alice is a young girl who falls down a rabbit hole and enters a fantastical world. The story is a work of fantasy, and its themes and characters are not necessarily bound by real-world moral or philosophical codes.

Masonic Lodges, on the other hand, are real-world organizations with their own set of principles, rituals, and symbolism. While the story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland does contain themes of curiosity, exploration, and self-discovery, it does not explicitly address the possibility of a Masonic Lodge.

However, if we were to interpret the story in a more allegorical sense, Alice's journey could be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual journey of self-discovery and growth that is often associated with Masonic principles. In this sense, it's possible to argue that Alice's character could be seen as a symbol of the aspirant or initiate in a Masonic context.

But, ultimately, it's unlikely that Alice would be able to join a real-world Masonic Lodge, as she is a fictional character and not a real person.

So, I would say the answer is (B) No."
"Bull sharks are known for their powerful jaws and aggressive behavior, but when it comes to the pain of a bite, it's difficult to make a direct comparison between shark and crocodile bites. However, I can provide some general information.

Bull shark bites are known for their powerful force, with some reports suggesting that they can exert a bite force of up to 1,000 pounds per square inch (psi). This is comparable to the bite force of a great white shark.

Crocodile bites, on the other hand, are also extremely powerful, with some species exerting a bite force of up to 3,700 psi. Saltwater crocodiles, in particular, are known for their incredibly powerful jaws and are considered one of the most aggressive and deadly predators in the world.

In terms of pain, it's likely that a crocodile bite would be more painful than a bull shark bite due to the sheer force and power of the crocodile's jaws. However, it's essential to note that both shark and crocodile bites can be extremely painful and potentially life-threatening.

So, while it's difficult to make a definitive statement, I would say that a crocodile bite might be more painful than a bull shark bite, but both are extremely painful and should be treated with caution and medical attention if necessary."
"I would say (A) No. In the story of Snow White, the Evil Queen is not given a choice in the matter, and her actions are driven by a desire for power and vanity.

The Greek alphabet is one of the most widely used alphabets in the world, and it has had a significant impact on the development of many other alphabets, including the Latin alphabet. However, it is not as ancient as Sumerian cuneiform, which was used by the ancient Sumerians around 4500-1900 BCE.

Sumerian cuneiform is considered one of the earliest forms of written language, and it was used for over 3,000 years. The Greek alphabet, on the other hand, was developed around 750 BCE and is still in use today.

So, while the Greek alphabet is very common and influential, it is not as ancient as Sumerian cuneiform."

Rainbows are formed when sunlight passes through water droplets in the air at a specific angle, creating the colors of the rainbow. The colors of the rainbow always appear in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. 

Lunching on the beach may provide a beautiful view, but it's unlikely to create the perfect conditions for spotting a full circle of a rainbow. Rainbows are typically seen after a rain shower or near a waterfall, and the sun must be behind the observer. The sun's position and the angle of the water droplets in the air are crucial for creating a rainbow."

"To determine if 500GB is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows, we need to know the average file size of a Netflix show.

The average file size of a Netflix show can vary greatly depending on the quality and resolution. However, a typical 4K UHD Netflix show can range from 1-5 GB per episode, while a standard HD show can range from 0.5-2 GB per episode.

Assuming an average file size of 2.5 GB per episode, we can calculate the total storage needed for 10 hours of Netflix shows as follows:

10 hours x 2.5 GB per hour = 25 GB

Since 500 GB is more than 25 GB, the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"To answer this question, we need to consider the mass of Jon Brower Minnoch and Voyager 2.

Research suggests that handedness does not play a significant role in determining how a person uses American Sign Language (ASL). In ASL, the dominant hand is not necessarily the same as the dominant hand in spoken languages, and many ASL users use both hands to communicate.

In fact, ASL is a visual-gestural language that relies heavily on non-manual markers, facial expressions, and body language, which are not necessarily tied to handedness. ASL users may use their non-dominant hand to perform certain actions or to emphasize certain points, but this is not a universal rule.

It's worth noting that ASL is a unique language with its own grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, and its use is not determined by handedness or any other physical characteristic."

The torso, which includes the rib cage, is generally protected by the rib cage, which is made up of 24 ribs that are connected to the spine and sternum (breastbone). This provides a degree of protection against blows to the torso.

The largest bone in the body is the femur (thigh bone), and the smallest bone is the stapes bone in the middle ear. Neither of these bones is located in the torso. The femur is located in the lower extremities, and the stapes bone is located in the middle ear, which is not protected by the rib cage.

Even if the cruise is not during the peak season, there's still a risk of storms and rough seas."

The term ""Eskimo"" is an outdated and somewhat derogatory term for the Inuit people, who are indigenous to the Arctic regions of Canada, Alaska, and Greenland. However, I will answer the question based on the general knowledge.

In the Arctic regions, the sun can be below the horizon for several months during the winter, and the sun can be extremely high in the sky during the summer. However, the sun's rays are often weak and diffuse due to the Earth's atmosphere and the presence of ice and snow. As a result, the Inuit people do not typically sunbathe in the classical sense, as the sun's UV radiation is not strong enough to cause significant tanning or sunburn."
A: (A) No
"(B) No

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as a Marxist-Leninist party, was based on the principles of socialism and communism. Trickle-down economics, on the other hand, is an economic theory that suggests that economic growth and prosperity will trickle down from the wealthy to the poor through tax cuts and deregulation. This theory is often associated with capitalist ideologies.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union would likely reject trickle-down economics as it contradicts their fundamental principles of class struggle and the redistribution of wealth. Instead, they would focus on collective ownership and equal distribution of resources, as seen in their planned economy and state-controlled industries."
"The correct answer is (A) No.

In the United States, there is no age limit for running for president. According to Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, a person must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for at least 14 years to be eligible to serve as president. Since an 11th grader is under 35 years old, they are not yet eligible to run for president, but they can still participate in the democratic process by voting and potentially running for other offices in the future."
The answer is (B) No.
"To determine if 2018 Ashland, Oregon's population is inadequate to be a hypothetical military division, we need to consider the typical population size for a military division.

A military division is a large unit of the armed forces, and its population can vary greatly depending on the country and branch of service. However, as a rough estimate, a military division can range from 10,000 to 50,000 personnel.

Ashland, Oregon's population in 2018 was approximately 94,415 people. Based on this number, it's unlikely that Ashland could support a full-fledged military division.

"To estimate the number of people that could fit in Tiger Stadium, we need to know its capacity. Tiger Stadium, also known as Tiger Stadium in Detroit, has a seating capacity of approximately 100,000 people.

The unemployment rate in 1933 was around 24.9% in the United States. Assuming an average population of 123 million people in the US at that time, we can estimate the number of unemployed people as follows:

24.9% of 123 million = 30.87 million

Now, let's compare this number to the stadium's capacity:

30,870,000 (unemployed people) / 100,000 (stadium capacity) ≈ 308.7

So, approximately 309,000 people could fit in Tiger Stadium, but not all 30.87 million unemployed people."

Oscar Wilde was tried and convicted in the UK for gross indecency, a crime that was used to prosecute individuals for same-sex relationships. The laws that led to his trial and conviction were based on the Labouchere Amendment to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, which made it an offense for two men to engage in ""carnal knowledge against the order of nature."" This law was used to target Wilde and other LGBTQ+ individuals, and it was not until 1967 that the UK decriminalized consensual same-sex relationships.

In the US, the laws regarding LGBTQ+ rights have evolved significantly since Wilde's time. The US Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) struck down state laws that criminalized same-sex relationships, recognizing that such laws were unconstitutional. However, the US still has a long way to go in terms of full equality and fairness for the LGBTQ+ community.

In the context of Wilde's treatment, it is clear that his trial and conviction were not fair, as they were based on a law that was designed to persecute and stigmatize LGBTQ+ individuals."

"I can provide an analysis based on the character of the Joker from various comic book series, movies, and interpretations.

The Joker is a complex and unpredictable character known for his chaotic and violent nature. His relationships with others are often tumultuous and short-lived, and he tends to manipulate and use people for his own amusement. He has been involved in romantic relationships with several characters, including Harley Quinn, but these relationships are often portrayed as toxic and abusive.

Given the Joker's personality and behavior, it's unlikely that he is in a healthy romantic relationship. His actions and treatment of others are often cruel and manipulative, which would make it difficult to consider a relationship with him as healthy.

So, the correct answer is:

(A) No"

Research suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally considered safe and effective for treating depression in teenagers and young adults, similar to adults. While there may be some concerns about the potential risks of SSRIs in this age group, such as increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, the benefits of these medications in treating depression often outweigh the risks.

In fact, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) and the American Psychiatric Association (APA) have both concluded that SSRIs are a safe and effective treatment option for depression in adolescents and young adults.

It's worth noting, however, that the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is higher in teenagers and young adults with depression, and close monitoring by a mental health professional is essential when prescribing SSRIs in this age group."

"Based on the 2020 Forbes Billionaires List, the richest person in the world was Jeff Bezos with an estimated net worth of around $207 billion. 

Considering the cost of purchasing Cambodia, it's difficult to estimate the exact price. However, Cambodia is a relatively affordable country to visit, with accommodation options ranging from budget-friendly guesthouses to luxury resorts. 

A private island in Cambodia, such as Koh Rong Samloem, can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million or more, depending on the size and amenities. However, owning a private island in Cambodia is not a feasible option for most billionaires.

A luxury villa or a large estate in Cambodia can cost anywhere from $500,000 to $50 million or more, depending on the location, size, and amenities. 

Considering these prices, it's unlikely that owning a private island or a luxury estate in Cambodia would be too expensive for the 2020 richest billionaire, Jeff Bezos."

"To answer this question, we need to consider the number of states in Ancient Greece and the number of states in the United States in 1900.

Ancient Greece was a collection of city-states, not a unified country with a fixed number of states. The city-states of Ancient Greece included Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and others, but the exact number varied over time and was not fixed. However, at its peak, there were around 500 city-states in Ancient Greece.

In contrast, the United States had 45 states in 1900.

So, considering the number of states, Ancient Greece had a much larger number of city-states than the US had states in 1900. Therefore, the answer is:

(A) Yes"

"Based on the fact that you mentioned your favorite color is black, I'll provide an answer.

A white cockatoo is a rare color variation of the cockatoo species. While it's not impossible for a white cockatoo to exist, it's worth noting that many white cockatoos may not survive to adulthood due to various health issues related to their rare coloration.

However, assuming a white cockatoo was born and raised in a suitable environment, it's theoretically possible for it to live through the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which was a global conflict that primarily affected Europe.

So, considering these factors, I'll choose:

(A) Yes"
"I'm not aware of any information about a ""Hooke Sea"". However, I can tell you that lifeboats are designed to rescue people in various bodies of water, including oceans. Assuming the ""Hooke Sea"" is a typo or a fictional body of water, the answer would be:

(B) Yes
(B) No
"It's not possible for a person to run for President of India. The President of India is an elected position, and the process of becoming the President involves a complex and expensive electoral process, including campaigning, advertising, and other expenses. However, the cost of running for President is not directly comparable to buying a new iPhone 11.

To put this into perspective, the cost of running for President of India can range from a few crores (tens of millions of dollars) to hundreds of crores (hundreds of millions of dollars), depending on the candidate's resources and the scope of their campaign.

On the other hand, the cost of a new iPhone 11 can range from around ₹50,000 to ₹70,000 (approximately $650-$900 USD), depending on the storage capacity and other features.

So, it's not necessarily more expensive to run for President of India than to buy a new iPhone 11."

The Matrix (1999) was a groundbreaking sci-fi film that grossed over $463 million worldwide on a budget of $63 million, making it a highly successful film.

Harry Potter, on the other hand, is a series of fantasy films based on the books by J.K. Rowling. The first film, ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" (released as ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" in the United States), was released in 2001 and grossed over $974 million worldwide on a budget of $125 million. The subsequent films in the series continued to perform well at the box office, with the final film, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2,"" grossing over $1.34 billion worldwide.

Considering the overall box office performance, Harry Potter was a more successful franchise for Warner Bros. than The Matrix."
(B) No
"It's highly unlikely that Queen Elizabeth I read the works of Jean-Paul Sartre. 

Queen Elizabeth I lived from 1533 to 1603, while Jean-Paul Sartre was born in 1905 and died in 1980. This means that Sartre's works were written more than 300 years after Elizabeth I's time."

Without a society, it would be impossible to create and maintain a jet plane."

"I can provide some information about Lhamo Thondup.

Lhamo Thondup, also known as Lhamo Thondup Tsering, is a Tibetan Buddhist nun who was born in 1936 and died in 2006. She was a renowned Tibetan Buddhist nun and a prominent figure in Tibetan Buddhism.

However, I couldn't find any information that suggests she was a Catholic nun or that the Catholic Church is considering her for sainthood. Lhamo Thondup was a Tibetan Buddhist nun, and her contributions and legacy are primarily recognized within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"

Ukemi is a Japanese term that refers to the art of falling and rolling to absorb the impact of a fall, often used in martial arts training.

"(B) Yes. The Jungle Book, written by Rudyard Kipling, has been criticized for its portrayal of non-European characters, particularly Indians and Native Americans. Some argue that the story perpetuates racist stereotypes and reinforces colonialist attitudes. The character of Mowgli, a white child raised by wolves, is also seen as a symbol of the ""white savior"" trope, which can be problematic. However, it's worth noting that Kipling's intentions were likely rooted in his own cultural context and not necessarily malicious. Nevertheless, the novel's depiction of non-European cultures has been widely criticized for its racist undertones."
"The correct answer is (A) No.

"The correct answer is (A) No.

The Great Recession, which occurred from 2007 to 2009, was a significant economic downturn, but it was not the period of the severest unemployment in U.S. history.

The period of the severest unemployment in U.S. history was actually the Great Depression, which occurred from 1929 to the late 1930s. Unemployment rates during the Great Depression peaked at around 25% in 1933, with some estimates as high as 33% in certain industries.

The Great Recession, on the other hand, saw unemployment rates peak at around 10% in October 2009, although some states experienced much higher rates, such as Nevada, which peaked at 14.7% in January 2010."

According to Islamic tradition, Jesus and his disciples were celebrating the last meal together before Jesus' arrest and crucifixion."
"The answer is (A) No.

In Japan, serfdom was not as widespread or deeply ingrained as it was in England. The Japanese serfs, known as ""shōnin,"" were tied to the land but had more rights and privileges than their English counterparts, such as the English peasantry. Japanese serfs were also more likely to be freed or move to cities, and they had access to education and social mobility. Additionally, the Japanese feudal system was more flexible and allowed for greater social mobility than the English system."
"To answer this question, we need to know the presidential number of Andrew Johnson and the Emperor number of Elagabalus.

Andrew Johnson was the 17th President of the United States, so his presidential number is 17.

Elagabalus, on the other hand, was a Roman Emperor, and his number is not directly comparable to a presidential number. However, if we consider the Roman numerals for Elagabalus, his reign is often numbered as 218-222 AD, which is equivalent to the Roman numeral CCXVIII.

Since 17 (Andrew Johnson's presidential number) is less than 218 (Elagabalus's Emperor number in Roman numerals), the answer is:

(B) No"

Sugar Ray Robinson was an American professional boxer, not Iranian. He was a legendary boxer who competed in the 1940s and 1950s. Boxing is a sport that originated in the United States, and it's unlikely that he would have been involved in boxing in Iran, especially considering the time period."
"To answer this question, let's consider the physical characteristics of both the cheetah and Big Show.

A cheetah is the fastest land animal on Earth, capable of reaching speeds of up to 70 mph (113 km/h). However, its physical strength is not its primary function. Cheetahs are built for speed, not for generating massive forces.

Big Show, on the other hand, is a professional wrestler, known for his incredible strength and size. He is a massive man, standing over 7 feet tall and weighing over 500 pounds (227 kg).

Given these characteristics, it's highly unlikely that a cheetah could generate enough force to topple Big Show. Cheetahs are agile and fast, but they don't possess the physical strength or mass to overcome the size and weight of a person like Big Show.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"

Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a German theologian and reformer who sparked the Protestant Reformation with his 95 Theses, criticizing certain practices of the Catholic Church. He is often referred to as the ""Father of the Protestant Reformation.""

Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968), on the other hand, was an American Baptist minister and civil rights activist who played a key role in the American civil rights movement. He advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience and delivered his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech.

Although both men shared a similar last name, they were not related and came from different historical periods and backgrounds. Martin Luther was a 16th-century theologian, while Martin Luther King Jr. was a 20th-century civil rights leader."
The answer is (A) No.
"The correct answer is (A) No.

King Arthur is a legendary figure from Arthurian legend, and his story is not directly connected to the historical events surrounding the execution of Anne Boleyn, who was the second wife of King Henry VIII of England.

"The correct answer is (A) No.

Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa mountaineer, was the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest, but he did not climb Snowdon. Snowdon is a mountain located in Wales, UK, and is not as high as Mount Everest.

"To answer this question, we need to know Javier Sotomayor's record. Javier Sotomayor is a Cuban-American long jumper, and his record is 8.95 meters (29 feet 4.5 inches). 

A Bengal cat, being a domesticated breed, is not capable of participating in long jumping events. Bengals are agile and athletic, but their physical abilities are geared towards climbing, jumping, and pouncing, not long jumping.

Therefore, it is not possible for a Bengal cat to hypothetically best Javier Sotomayor's record."

However, there is no law that prohibits a licensed child from being employed in a non-driving capacity, such as working in a non-operational role within a company that owns or services Mercedes-Benz vehicles, like a mechanic, salesperson, or administrative staff."
(B) No.
"The correct answer is (A) No.

While it's true that gay men cannot biologically father children on their own, it's not because they are unable to reproduce. Rather, it's because sperm from a gay male is typically not viable for fertilization of an egg.
