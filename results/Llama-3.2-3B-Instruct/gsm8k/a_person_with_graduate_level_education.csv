"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (we'll round down to 3 muffins since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she has left after baking: 13 - 3 = 10 eggs.

She sells the remaining 10 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. So, she makes 10 * 2 = $20 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the number of bolts of blue and white fibers together: 
2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs per sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints per week.

Number of meters per sprint = 60 meters
Number of sprints per week = 3 sprints

Total meters per week = Number of meters per sprint * Number of sprints per week
Total meters per week = 60 meters * 3
Total meters per week = 180 meters

The total number of meters James runs per week is 180 meters."
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given and subtract that from the total amount of feed she gives in a day.

She gives 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. 

Total feed given so far = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given so far from the total amount of feed needed for the day.

Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed for the day - Total feed given so far
Feed needed for the final meal = 60 - 40
Feed needed for the final meal = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

Now, we add the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses is $50.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Next, we need to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add up the number of sheep each city has to find the total number of sheep: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:

60% of 200 GB = 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:

Total time so far = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Total time = 80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 3 hours, the first 2 hours of the return trip, and the last 2 hours of the return trip.

1. Distance covered in the first 3 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

2. Distance covered in the first 2 hours of the return trip:
Distance = Speed * Time

"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual revenue from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual cost of maintenance: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the point where the net profit is greater than $0. To do this, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

However, this calculation only accounts for the initial cost and does not take into account the fact that the tree will start producing lemons after the first year. 

Let's recalculate the break-even point by considering the first year separately:

Year 1: Initial cost of $90, no revenue, net loss of $90
Year 2: Initial cost of $90, revenue of $10.50, net profit of $0.50
Year 3: Initial cost of $90, revenue of $10.50 + $10.50 = $21, net profit of $21 - $3 = $18
Year 4: Initial cost of $90, revenue of $10.50 + $10.50 + $10.50 = $31.50, net profit of $31.50 - $3 = $28.50

As we can see, the tree starts earning money in the third year.

Final answer: 3"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as 'x'.

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has 2/3x vacuum cleaners left.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has 2/3x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has 1/2 * (2/3x - 2) vacuum cleaners left.
4. We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: 1/2 * (2/3x - 2) = 5.

Now, let's solve the equation:
1/2 * (2/3x - 2) = 5
(2/3x - 2) = 10
2/3x = 12
x = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the future value of both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Market increase = 2.5%
Future value = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Market increase = 1.2%
Future value = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the future value of the jewelry ($5,250) is less than the future value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Future value of electronic gadgets - Initial value of electronic gadgets
= $8,160 - $8,000
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling at the same time and in the same direction, they will cover the same distance.

For the second part, they travel 150 miles northward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the distances covered by both trains. 

So, the total distance covered by each train is:

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary as a teacher: 
- Number of hours worked per week: 35 hours
- Hourly wage: $20
- Annual hours worked: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual salary as a teacher: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Her annual salary as a coach: 
- Number of hours worked per week: 15 hours
- Hourly wage: $30
- Annual hours worked: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual salary as a coach: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Total annual salary: $35,000/year (teacher) + $22,500/year (coach) = $57,500/year

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, we multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so there are 4 x 7 = 28 days in 4 weeks.

Now, we multiply the number of eggs she makes per day (3) by the number of days in 4 weeks (28):

3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen

Therefore, Claire eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

Final answer: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she should spend walking the entire trail.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to maintain her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 miles - (4 miles + 2 miles)
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = (27 + 20)/3 = 47/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 47/3 - 1 = 44/3 liters.

To convert this to a decimal, we divide 44 by 3: 44/3 ≈ 14.67 liters.

The final answer is 14.67."
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age difference between Raymond and his son, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 25 - 23 = 2.

Since we want to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the age difference from the current year. However, we don't know the current year. We can assume that the current year is the year after Samantha's age, which is 31 + 1 = 32.

Now, we subtract the age difference (2) from the current year (32): 32 - 2 = 30.

Therefore, Raymond's son was 30 years ago when Samantha was 31."
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the price he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that the price Kyle paid is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract that from the total distance of the trip.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Henry stopped after 20 miles, so the distance he traveled before his second stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance between his first and second stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * 33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is 33 + 66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: 
99 = B - 5

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
B = 99 + 5
B = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3 (the number of guesses).

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
   Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
   Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 
   Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

Final answer: $75.00"
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left, we can find the amount he spent on video games and Lego sets by subtracting the amount he had left from the total amount he got: $195 - $160 - $5 = $30.

Now, we know that John spent $30 on video games and Lego sets. Since he spent $20 on video games, he must have spent $10 on Lego sets.

To find out how many Lego sets he has left, we can divide the amount he spent on Lego sets ($10) by the price of each Lego set ($15). 

$10 / $15 = 2/3.

Since we can't have a fraction of a Lego set, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that he might have spent on a fraction of a set, but since he can't buy a fraction of a Lego set, we can assume he bought 2 sets and had 1 set left.

So, John has 11 Lego sets left."
"To find John's running speed, we need to first calculate the total number of hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. Since he runs for 2 days at 1.5 hours, the total hours for those days is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours. 

Adding the hours from the first day, we get 3 + 3 = 6 hours per week.

Now, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. 

Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is her running speed multiplied by the time she spends running, which is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is her walking speed multiplied by the time she spends walking, which is 3 * 2 = 6 miles.

The total distance she travels is the sum of the distances she travels while running and walking, which is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone as 'x'. Since she can throw the javelin three times farther with the gemstone, the distance with the gemstone would be 3x.

We know that the distance the javelin can reach with the gemstone (3x) is still within the dragon's reach of 1000 feet. 

So, we can set up the equation: 3x ≤ 1000

To find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x ≤ 1000 / 3
x ≤ 333.33

Now, we need to find the distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach while holding the gemstone. This distance would be the difference between the distance with the gemstone (3x) and the dragon's reach (1000 feet).

Distance = 3x - 1000
Distance = 3 * 333.33 - 1000
Distance = 1000 - 1000 + 999.99
Distance ≈ 999.99

So, Polly can stand approximately 999.99 feet outside the dragon's reach while holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: 999.99"
"To find the total number of pieces taken by the guests, we need to first find the total number of pieces initially available. 

There were 5 pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces initially available is 5 x 8 = 40.

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. So, the remaining calories available for consumption are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have left: 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we can multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 servings * 5 grams per serving = 4 grams.

Therefore, you can eat 4 grams of chips.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes an average of 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 times the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. 
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds from the toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, $480 (Friday) is greater than $520 (Thursday). 
To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means Friday's revenue was lower than Thursday's revenue.

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, we add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Since there are 25 oranges in total, the number of good oranges is: 
25 - 8 = 17 oranges

The final answer is: 17"

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the initial pension is $50,000, the value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

Now, we need to calculate 5% of $1,000,000, which is $1,000,000 * 0.05 = $50,000.

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $50,000 (initial pension) + $50,000 (5% of the value of the pension) = $100,000.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $100,000.

Final answer: $100,000"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her the full amount of $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her 10% less money per month. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the amount charged per month for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she has already used (4 gallons) and then add the distance she has already traveled (100 miles).

First, let's calculate the remaining capacity of her tank:
12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons remaining

Now, we can calculate the total distance she can drive on a single tank:
8 gallons (remaining) * 25 miles per gallon (average miles per gallon) = 200 miles

However, since she has already traveled 100 miles, we need to add that to the total distance:
200 miles + 100 miles = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and there are 4 schools. So, the total number of teams is 2 teams/school * 4 schools = 8 teams.

Each team has 5 players, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of players is 5 players/team * 8 teams = 40 players.

Each team has 1 coach, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of coaches is 1 coach/team * 8 teams = 8 coaches.

Now, we add the total number of players and coaches to find the total number of people sent by the schools. Total people = 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of gemstone: 
175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

Therefore, there are 595 gems in the chest.

595"

"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.

She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays, so she teaches 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays. 

She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. So, the total number of classes she teaches in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students she teaches in a week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Since she charges $15 per student, her total weekly earnings are 495 * $15 = $7,475.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

Now, we add the total cost and the total interest to get the total amount Shiela will pay each month: $750 + $15 = $765.

To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3: $765 / 3 = $255.

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can find the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1 (top): 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total square footage by 4 to find the average:
30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the remaining days in the year.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The remaining days in the year are 365 - 180 = 185 days. After the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry.

Sarah's laundry: 400 pounds
David's laundry: 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 2 to find Raymond's laundry.

Raymond's laundry: 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David.

Difference: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds

"To determine the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we need to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each and 0 packages of 0 flowers (which is not possible).
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the other option:
$15 - $9 = $6

The final answer is: $6"

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since the number of games won is x + 8, we can substitute x = 7 into this expression: 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time is x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

So, Gerald's original time was 36 seconds.

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 seconds is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds.

Adding this to his original time, we get:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds with his improved diet.

The final answer is: 39.6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to find the combined number of dogs and cats first.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

16 ounces / 3 = 5.33 tomatoes

So, Freda used approximately 5.33 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. 

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 25.

Solving for x, we get x = 25 - 20 = 5.

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he needs to read per day:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of water before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles/10 minutes
Time = 14 minutes

The fog bank will take 14 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pieces Poppy places on the board and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board. A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy places 250 pieces. The remaining pieces are 1000 - 250 = 750.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces on the board. A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces. The number of pieces left is 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we need to first find out how many cookies Cody eats. 

Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

Now, we add the number of cookies eaten by Amir and Cody to find the total number of cookies eaten by both of them. 
Total cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, let's break down the total time Frankie watched TV:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: Let's denote the number of episodes as 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time spent on Wednesday is 0.5x hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Total time spent watching TV = 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 5 + 0.5x

We know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, we can set up the equation:

5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5 from both sides:

0.5x = 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

x = 4

Since 'x' represents the number of episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes, the total time spent on Wednesday is 0.5x = 0.5 * 4 = 2 hours.

Since 2 hours is equal to 2 * 30 minutes, Frankie watched 2 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday.

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he will bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that the number of cookies he has left is 110, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each roll and then add them together.

For Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups * 24 rolls = 48 roll-ups
For Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups * 14 rolls = 42 roll-ups

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 to find the average:

90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many feet Julia rows per second. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find her speed as follows:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Speed = 1.25 feet per second

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows. To find out how much water it takes on per second, we can divide 2 liters by 10 feet:
Water per foot = 2 liters / 10 feet
Water per foot = 0.2 liters per foot

Now, we can find out how much water the boat takes on per second:
Water per second = Water per foot * Speed
Water per second = 0.2 liters/foot * 1.25 feet/second
Water per second = 0.25 liters/second

Since Julia is 64 seconds away from the shore, we can find out how much water the boat takes on in 64 seconds:
Total water taken on = Water per second * Time
Total water taken on = 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds
Total water taken on = 16 liters

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is 8 * 3 = 24.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so we can write an equation: 
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 
So, we can write another equation: 
B = 50D

Now we can equate the two expressions for B:
300 = 50D

To find the number of ducks (D), we can divide both sides by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

The total cost of all the boards is the sum of the costs of the two types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of each board is 1.5 times the original price. 
The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 * $10 = $15 per board
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 * $16 = $24 per board

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120

The total revenue from selling all the boards is $150 + $120 = $270

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio. 

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part.

120 / 20 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part (6) by the number of parts of sugar (7) to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

6 * 7 = 42

The final answer is 42."

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day.

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Current salary = $40,000 + (30% of $40,000)
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Now, we know Adrien's current salary is $52,000. We are also told that his salary increased by 40% four years later. To find his new salary, we can calculate:

New salary = $52,000 + (40% of $52,000)
= $52,000 + 0.4 * $52,000
= $52,000 + $20,800
= $72,800

Now, we know Adrien's new salary is $72,800. Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we can assume her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's. However, we don't know Lylah's original salary. We can use the fact that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago to set up an equation:

$40,000 = x + 0.3x
$40,000 = 1.3x
x = $30,769 (approximately)

Now that we know Lylah's original salary, we can calculate her new salary:

New salary = $30,769 + (40% of $30,769)
= $30,769 + 0.4 * $30,769
= $30,769 + $12,307.60
= $43,076.60

Now that we know both Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= $72,800 + $43,076.60
= $115,876.60

The final answer is: $115,876.60"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper per week.

Now, we multiply the number of sheets he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month (4):

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29

The total hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 29."
"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of:
10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of:
5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances covered in both parts:
30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that the total number of letters with stamps is 30. To find the initial number of letters with stamps, we can subtract the number of letters with stamps Jennie put on from the total number of letters with stamps:

Initial number of letters with stamps = Total number of letters with stamps - Number of letters with stamps Jennie put on
= 30 - 20
= 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then she bought a package of 'x' spoons, so she had x spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2 spoons.

We are given that she had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 12

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day and then the total revenue from patients and the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000
Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients - Total cost of doctors' time
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 in profit per day."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given the following information:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: W = 2B
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: B = 2Q
3. The total number of bees is 700: W + B + Q = 700

Now, we can substitute the expressions for W and B from the first two equations into the third equation:
2B + B + Q = 700
Combine like terms:
3B + Q = 700

Substitute B = 2Q into the equation:
3(2Q) + Q = 700
Expand and simplify:
6Q + Q = 700
Combine like terms:
7Q = 700

Now, divide both sides by 7:
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q
B = 2(100)
B = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2B
W = 2(200)
W = 400

The total cost of the non-food items is: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
- Total non-food cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we need to calculate the tax on the non-food items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:
- Tax amount: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of the non-food items:
- Total non-food cost with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the non-food items with tax:
- Total cost: $5 + $11 = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 
Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40
Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Total income: $92

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box together: 
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the initial 30 bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned after the first 12 hours is 30 (initial return) + 15 (second return) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before the last 6 hours return to the hive. Since 30 bees left initially and 15 returned, 30 - 15 = 15 bees are still out.

In the last 6 hours, all the remaining 15 bees that left before the last 6 hours return to the hive.

So, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15.

Final answer: 15"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:

$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount of money she gave the cashier is:

$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can divide Charlie's number of friends by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' number of friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between the time it takes for Tim to get home and the time it takes for Steve to get home.

Time Tim will be waiting: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Since each cookie costs $0.10, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change:
$10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Now, to find the initial number of fries in the pack, we need to add the fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, the pigeons, the raccoon, and the ants to the remaining fries: 48 (eaten) + 5 (remaining) = 53 fries.

However, we need to account for the fries eaten by the seagull, which is 7 fries. So, the initial number of fries in the pack is 53 + 7 = 60 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches/foot * 2 feet/baguette = 2880 inches.

Now, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the total length by 12.

Total length in inches = 1200 + 720 + 2880 = 4800 inches.
Total length in feet = 4800 inches / 12 = 400 feet.

"To find the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total monthly demand and then multiply it by 2.

The total monthly demand is the sum of the demand of all the apes:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas
Total monthly demand = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly demand by 2:
Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas

"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers the entire length of the field (100 yards) 15 times. 
Distance covered by Blake = 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering the entire length of the field (100 yards), and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 60 yards. 
Distance covered by Kelly in the first run = 100 yards
Distance covered by Kelly in the subsequent 33 runs = 60 yards * 33 = 1980 yards
Total distance covered by Kelly = 100 yards + 1980 yards = 2080 yards

Since Blake ran 1500 yards and Kelly ran 2080 yards, Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.
Difference in distance = 2080 yards - 1500 yards = 580 yards

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so we add them to the initial number: 11 + 6 = 17
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we subtract them from the total: 17 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find the depth on Wednesday, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3.

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24

"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19
Locsin's total: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13

"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to apply the 20% increase every two months.

Initial price = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and we still need to find the age of the fourth bird.

Since the problem states ""There are four birds at the Caboose,"" we can infer that the fourth bird is also Sally Two, as the problem mentions ""the four birds"" and Sally Two is already mentioned. However, this seems to be a trick question, as it's unlikely that there would be two birds with the same name. 

Assuming the problem is asking for the total age of the four birds, we can add up the ages of the three birds we know: 8 + 19 + 16 = 43.

"To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to first find out how much Jessica wants to pay for each debt. 

For her student loans, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $300. 
50% of $300 is $150, so she wants to pay $300 + $150 = $450 per month.

For her credit card, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $200. 
50% of $200 is $100, so she wants to pay $200 + $100 = $300 per month.

For her mortgage, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $500. 
50% of $500 is $250, so she wants to pay $500 + $250 = $750 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly payments: 
$450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500 per month.

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato, then multiply these times by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds
Total time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Now, we multiply the total time to peel and cut one potato by the total number of potatoes:
95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10x - Cost = $25

We know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Since they make $10 per gallon, the cost per gallon is $5. 

Now, we can substitute the cost per gallon into the equation:

$10x - $5x = $25
$5x = $25
x = $5

This means they made 5 gallons of lemonade. Since the cost per gallon is $5, the total cost of lemons is 5 * $5 = $25.

5. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity: 1/2 of 3400$ is 1700$.
6. Remaining amount after donation: 3400$ - 1700$ = 1700$.
7. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount given away is 200$ + 700$ = 900$.
8. Final remaining amount: 1700$ - 900$ = 800$.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crabs each person has and then add them together.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

Total earnings for the first two weeks = $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of students who voted (80) by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = 80 * (3/4) = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses, which is four times the number of white carnations:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Since Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, we need to find out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm. To do this, we need to know the total number of red roses that were originally ordered. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide this information. However, we can infer that the number of red roses that were originally ordered is at least 160, since that is the number of red roses that Fred has delivered so far.

Therefore, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver at least 160 red roses by 5 pm."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information that Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years. 
Since Mark was 5 years older than that, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.

Now, we know Mark's age two years ago. To find Mark's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. 
Mark's current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

We are also given that Jean is two years older than Mark. 
So, Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per leg, so their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in their times is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event (rolling a number less than or equal to 3) on the first roll, which is 3/6.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll, given that the first roll was less than or equal to 3, is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, given that the first roll was even, is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row as:

P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = P(rolling an even number on the first roll) * P(rolling an even number on the second roll | rolling an even number on the first roll)
= (1/2) * (1/4)
= 1/8

Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3) = 1 - P(rolling a number less than or equal to 3)
= 1 - 1/2
= 1/2

Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row) = P(rolling a number greater than 3) * P(rolling two even numbers in a row | rolling a number greater than 3)
= (1/2) * (1/8)
= 1/16

Now, we can calculate the difference in probability as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3) - P(rolling two even numbers in a row)
= 1/2 - 1/16
= 7/16

To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

(7/16) * 100 = 43.75%

The final answer is: 43.75"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked by adding Jenna's and her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and the rabbits. 

For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
For the rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, we subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 
160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we divide the remaining straw by 3 to find the number of straw pieces per cage:
90 / 3 = 30 pieces of straw per cage

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we divide the number of straw pieces per cage by 6 to find the number of rats in each cage:
30 / 6 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the debt after 3 months, we need to multiply the interest for one month by 3.

Total interest = Interest for one month * 3
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the transportation cost:
Total cost = Total cost + Transportation cost
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, let's find the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total revenue - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

However, this is the total number of bags bought, not sold. Since the trader sold 13 bags, the number of bags bought is actually 13 * 9 = 117."
"To find the total cost of the food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we need to find the total cost of all expenses. 
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we need to divide the total weekly amount by 7 days.

Weekly amount: 3.5 pounds
Days in a week: 7

Insects per day = Weekly amount / Days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

The flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom plants and chops down each year, and then subtract the total number of trees that die after 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so after 10 years, he will have planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees per year, so after 10 years, he will have chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After planting 100 trees, he now has 50 + 100 = 150 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.3: 150 * 0.3 = 45.

So, 45 trees die, leaving Tom with 150 - 45 = 105 trees.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Since she needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost will be:

5 crayons * $2 per crayon = $10

Since Violetta has $20, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has:

$20 - $10 = $10

So, Violetta will get $10 as change."

There are 40 restaurants, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. 

Total pounds of carrots to be distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots to be distributed = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots to be distributed = 80 pounds

Since there are 200 pounds of carrots in total, and 80 pounds will be distributed, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

200 - 80 = 120 pounds

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has:
20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we can add the amounts Mark earns from both publishers to find his total weekly earnings:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters.

Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the monetary reward: $5000.

Since John received the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for the entire year. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is $2000. 

5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

So, his new salary will be $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year. He works 52 weeks in a year (ignoring holidays and other days off). 

His total earnings for the year will be: 
- Monetary reward: $5000
- Salary for 51 weeks: 52 * $2100 = $108,000

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the required score, we first need to calculate the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after six tests. 

The total score for six tests to achieve an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the required score for the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five scores (excluding the lowest score) from the total required score: 
558 - (358 - 71) = 558 - 287 = 271.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 271 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode 5 times a week, 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks is:
5 * 25 * 4 = 500 kilometers

In the last three weeks, Micheal rode 2 times a week, 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks is:
2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers

500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is 860."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Since she earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session, we need to find the number of sessions that will give her $60.

Let's divide $60 by $5 (babysitting) and $4 (lawn mowing) to find the number of sessions:

$60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions
$60 / $4 = 15 lawn mowing sessions

Since Sara can't mow the lawn 15 times (as that would be 15 sessions, not 12), we need to find the least common multiple of 12 and 15. The least common multiple of 12 and 15 is 60.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 60 / 15 = 4 times.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'r + 2' (since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens).

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park (1.5 miles by 6 miles), we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We know this is equal to y, so we can set up another equation:

x - 16 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the equations:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is $200. So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She will pay $165 per month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to return to find the remaining balance.
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

Number of roses = 4

The total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to calculate their ages in three years. We add 3 to each of their current ages.

Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3.

Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points scored by the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is: 54"

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 from the initial amount of 120 liters.

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Then, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply the remaining amount by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining amount in the tank.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to first find the number of petunias he plants. 

Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums: 
90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:
90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140 flowers.

The total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the first year and the amount spent in the second year.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Then, he loses 8 water type cards. 
New total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

He buys 14 grass type cards. 
New total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
New water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (number of water type cards / total cards) * 100
= (32 / 96) * 100
= 0.3333 * 100
= 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can complete per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda's rate: 4 pieces/minute
Her mom's rate: 4 / 2 = 2 pieces/minute

Combined rate: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces/minute

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total number of pieces by the combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle in minutes:

360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest, so we need to find 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially. 

Now, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. 

To find the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons.

84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of $240,000, which is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for the cars are $1000 * 12 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first find the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Number of ants = 50
Number of bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we need to add the number of bugs and ants to find the total number of insects in the garden.

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins are involved in the activities mentioned.

One-third of the penguins jump in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner, which is also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Since 12 penguins are involved in both activities, we need to subtract them from the total to avoid double-counting. So, we subtract 12 + 12 = 24 penguins from the total.

Now, we subtract 24 from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 days to get the total number of tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half of what he eats. So, she eats 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes Steve needs in total per week. Since he eats 42 tomatoes per week and his girlfriend eats 21 tomatoes per week, the total number of tomatoes they need per week is 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes needed per week by 3 to find out how many vines Steve needs.

63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Ram is essentially recycling the ink from the used pens to make new ones. 

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. When the ink runs low, he mixes the ink from 5 used pens to make one new pen. This means that for every 5 used pens, he gets 1 new pen.

So, if he uses 25 pens, he will have 5 sets of 5 used pens, which will give him 5 new pens. 

Therefore, Ram will have 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find Robert's candies. 

John has 54 candies, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and each sends 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can calculate the total time he spends writing per week: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes. 

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle had taken. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as x. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries. Colby took 2 fries from Griffin, so Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday, we need to multiply the number of cookies her sister ate on Tuesday by 2.
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies Sue ate. 
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

To find the total number of cookies eaten by her sister, we add the cookies eaten on both days.
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Now, we can find the difference in the number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister.
Difference in cookies = 46 - 18 = 28 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can find the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister by multiplying the difference in cookies by 200.
Total calories consumed by Sue = 28 * 200 = 5600 calories
Total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:

"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine the total number of cows in the 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall, so the total number of cows in 20 stalls is 20 * 20 = 400 cows.

After Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes 400 + 40 = 440 cows.

Since Mr. Sylas divides the 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls, each stall will have 40 / 20 = 2 additional cows.

Now, we need to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 additional cows, 8 stalls will have 8 * 2 = 16 additional cows.

The total number of cows in 8 stalls is the sum of the initial number of cows in 8 stalls and the additional cows, which is 8 * 20 + 16 = 176 cows.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we first need to find the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate into it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the redwood (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 
200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of 8000 pounds:
30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy owes, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Since she has at least one book that's over a week overdue, she owes a flat fee of $2.00.

The total amount Nancy owes is $4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00.

Final answer: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52.

Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find Jamal's bananas by adding 4 to his apples.

Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find Andrea's bananas by dividing Jamal's bananas by 2.

Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal.

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
= 52 + 24 + 44 + 48
= 128

The final answer is: 128"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day separately and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

Now, we add the amount of flour needed for both days:

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first find two thirds of 9,300.

Two thirds of 9,300 is calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = 62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $0.62."

"To find the number of trees in each yard, we need to follow the given information:

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so Harry has 2 * 3 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, we add the total fees to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price of the house and her budget is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $250,000 (loan amount) = $282,000

Net proceeds: $400,000 (selling price) - $282,000 (total amount paid) = $118,000

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 
2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows in the bedrooms.

To find the total number of windows in the additional windows not connected to bedrooms, we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house: 
2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows.

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 
12 windows in the bedrooms + 8 windows in the additional windows = 20 windows.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. The solo song has 54 lines. This is the number of lines Sean has to memorize for the song.

2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. So, the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines.

3. Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

4. The second scene has six more lines than the song. So, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.

5. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize in the second scene is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

6. To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as M and Marco's current age as C. We know that M + C = 20.

Since we don't know the exact ages, we can represent their ages in 10 years as M + 10 and C + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20.

We already know that M + C = 20, so we can substitute this into the equation: 
M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write the equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Substituting R = 6S into the second equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Expanding the equation, we get: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get: 3S + 9 = 27.

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 3S = 18.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 6.

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake. 

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To find the total length of the space between the topaz gemstones, we need to subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches. 

Now, subtracting the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 
25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (gemstones) = 17 inches

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to divide the remaining space by the length of each bead to find the number of beads used. 

17 inches (remaining space) / 0.25 inches (bead length) = 68 beads

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week and then add them up.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 
The remaining stars are 76 - (24 + 12) = 40. 

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars.

"To find the total weight of the flagstones, we need to multiply the number of flagstones by their individual weight.

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight per flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals given out for counting as 'x'. 

Since Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This can be represented as 39 = (1/10)x.

To find the value of 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

10 * 39 = x
390 = x

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she works:
- She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours.
- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.
- However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract 30 minutes from the total minutes she works.
- Total minutes worked = 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Now, let's calculate her earnings:
- She earns $5 every 10 minutes.
- To find out how much she earns per minute, we divide $5 by 10, which is $0.50 per minute.
- Now, we multiply her earnings per minute by the total minutes she works: 150 * $0.50 = $75.

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."

On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
On the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Since his target was 120 crates, we can find the difference by subtracting the total crates sold from the target.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent on the desk. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, and there were 3 other people who bid once. This means the bids rose by $50 three times. 

The initial bid was $200. 

The first bid after the initial bid was $200 + $50 = $250. 
The second bid after the first bid was $250 + $50 = $300. 
The third bid after the second bid was $300 + $50 = $350. 

Since there were 3 other people who bid once, we need to add the initial bid of $200 to the final bid of $350, and then add the $50 increments for the 3 other bids. 

The total cost of the desk is $200 + $350 + $150 (3 x $50) = $700."

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total cost of driving = Total miles driven per year * $2 per mile
= 21,600 miles/year * $2 per mile
= $43,200 per year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. So, the total bonus per year = $150 per month * 12 months/year = $1,800 per year

Total cost of driving per year = Total cost of driving + Total bonus per year
= $43,200 per year + $1,800 per year
= $45,000 per year

The final answer is: $45,000"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Time exercised on Monday = 16 minutes
Time exercised on Sunday = 23 minutes
Total time exercised on Monday and Sunday = 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2.

Time needed on Tuesday = 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper.

When folding the paper, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

For the left side, we have 16 pages (pages 1-16). 
For the right side, we have 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each side has 16 pages, we need 2 pieces of paper to create one side of the tabloid. 

To create a 32-page tabloid, we need 2 sides, so the total number of pieces of paper used is 2 * 2 = 4.

Final answer: 4"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total amount spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total amount spent) = $15

Annika has $15 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the current year is x/2.

We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We also know that the number of books sold in the first year is x, and the number of books sold in the current year is x/2. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 = 200

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + x = 400

Combine like terms:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since x represents the number of books sold in the first year, the number of books sold in the current year is x/2 = 133.33/2 = 66.67.

We know that each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the first year is 133.33 * 20 = $2666.66.

We are also given that the sales number this year is 45. Since the number of books sold in the current year is 66.67, the total amount of money earned in the current year is 66.67 * 20 = $1333.33.

To find the total amount of money earned in the second year, we subtract the amount earned in the first year from the amount earned in the current year:

Total amount earned in the second year = Amount earned in the current year - Amount earned in the first year
= $1333.33 - $2666.66
= -$1333.33

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

The correct calculation for the amount earned in the first year is 133.33 * 20 = $2666.66.

The correct calculation for the amount earned in the current year is 66.67 * 20 = $1333.33.

The correct calculation for the amount earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = $900.

The total amount of money earned in the first year is $2666.66.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is $900.

"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:
10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for April would be:
$100/day * 30 days = $3000

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the whole month. So, his total earnings for April would be:
$3000 + $300 = $3300

The final answer is: $3300"

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks to get the weight loss per week.

Weight loss per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we can divide the total weight by the weight loss per week.

Total weight = 8 pounds
Weight loss per week = 2 pounds

Number of weeks = Total weight / Weight loss per week
= 8 pounds / 2 pounds
= 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. 
Adding $700 to this gives us $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract this from the total cost of the trip: 
$1950 - $2000 = -$50

However, since we can't spend a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the calculation. The issue is that the flight ticket is more expensive than the total cost of the business suits and suitcases. This means that Theo won't be able to afford the flight ticket and the trip. 

However, if we assume that the flight ticket is indeed $1200, then we can proceed with the calculation. 

In this case, Theo has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left after buying the business suits and suitcases. Since he wants to save $2000, he will have $4050 - $2000 = $2050 left for gifts.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We can substitute C = 46 into this equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we know Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile six years ago. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so we can set up the equation:

Population six years ago = 3000N
Population six years ago = 3000(26)
Population six years ago = 78000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, we can set up the equation:

Population six years ago = (1/2)Population now
78000 = (1/2)Population now
Population now = 2 * 78000
Population now = 156000

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Since his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and Solomon bought 20 marbles, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

2. Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8) to find the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28.

3. The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store is 50 + 28 = 78.

4. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth.

Volume = Length * Width * Depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 * 0.1
Total Cost = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation: 
3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women.

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:
Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Now, we know that 3 men left, and 10 people in total left. Since we know that 3 men left, the number of women who left is:
Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:
Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.
2. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

The total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46. 

Since the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 48 = 26
3x = -22
x = -22/3
x = -7.33 (we can't have a fraction of a pencil, so this doesn't make sense in this context)

However, let's re-evaluate the problem. We can assume that the 26 pencils are the total number of pencils Jam has, and Meg has 46 pencils. We can set up the equation:
3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

So, Jam has 8 pencils in each box. Now, we can find the total number of boxes Jam has:
3 boxes (full) + 1 box (for the 2 loose pencils) = 4 boxes

The total number of boxes is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes used:

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. This will directly weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Now, we can calculate the total weakening effect of the coffee:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

We know that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records. Since each person gets 1 new record, the total number of new records is 7. However, this is not directly related to the number of old records. We need to find out how many old records were traded.

Let's assume the number of old records traded is x. Since the ratio is 2:1, the number of new records traded is x/2.

Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can set up the equation:

5 * (x/2) = 7

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

5x = 14

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 14/5
x = 2.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't round down because the ratio is 2:1, and 2.8 is not a whole number. 

However, we can round up to the nearest whole number to ensure we have enough old records to trade for 7 new records. 

x = 3

So, the 5 people brought in 3 * 2 = 6 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given:
- Total number of employees = 100
- Junior programmers are 2/5 of the total number of employees
- Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month
- Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
2/5 of 100 = (2/5) * 100 = 40 junior programmers

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, their salary is:
$2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

Now, let's find the number of senior programmers:
Total number of employees = 100
Number of junior programmers = 40
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:
Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 more got on at the second stop. However, we don't know the number of people who got on at the terminal. Let's call this number 'x'. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 5 + (8 - 7) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 5 + 1 = 20

x + 6 = 20

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

x = 14

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so the remaining charge is 100% - 60% = 40%.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

40 minutes / 60 = 2/3 hours

So, it will take 2/3 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

Initially, Erin has 7 lollipops.
Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she is left with 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and received $1 off for every $20 spent. Since $80 is 4 times $20, they received 4 rewards. 

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the rewards they received were halved. 

The customer received 4 rewards, but they were halved, so they received 4 / 2 = 2 rewards. 

The rewards they received were worth $1 each, so they received 2 * $1 = $2 off.

Now, we subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: $80 - $2 = $78.

The customer paid $78 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay of both jobs, Job B has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220 and then divide that number by 2.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's represent the number of cows as 'x'. Then, the number of chickens will be 2x.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2 * 20 = 40

Now that we know the number of chickens (40) and cows (20), we can calculate the total number of legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of chicken legs is 40 * 2 = 80.

Cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of cow legs is 20 * 4 = 80.

The total number of legs is 80 (chicken legs) + 80 (cow legs) = 160.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird.

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 20 pounds (container) + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will also need to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. We know that the cost of the activities is $30 per person. 

So, the number of friends she can invite is $60 / $30 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

Final answer: $0"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as his change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs, so he must have spent $8 - $2 = $6 on candy.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the amount he spent on candy ($6) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$6 / $1.5 = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. 

We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation: 
C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:
45 = 2S - 5

Now, let's solve for S:
45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S
S = 50 / 2
S = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in a day by the distance between services: 900 / 18,000 = 0.05 days.

To convert days to hours, we multiply by 24: 0.05 * 24 = 1.2 hours.

So, the train goes between services approximately 1.2 hours."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
For 3 collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

Time taken to drive to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Time taken for the detour:
Distance = 10 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours

Time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip:
Total time = Time taken to drive to his friend's house + Time taken for the detour + Time taken to drive back home
Total time = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, which is 4 * 3 = 12.
3. The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks and shoplifting is 3 + 12 = 15.
4. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which is 3 * 12 = 36.
5. The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is 15 + 36 = 51.
6. Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 51 = -1. However, this is not possible, as the number of people cannot be negative. This indicates that the problem has no solution.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin had 3x points before.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14 + 8 (since Sara scored 8 points)

Combine like terms:
3x = 22

Now, divide both sides by 3:
x = 22 / 3
x = 7.33

So, Sara had approximately 7.33 points before. 

Since Erin had 3 times more points than Sara, Erin had 3 * 7.33 = 22.99 points before.

The final answer is 22.99."

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400
Materials cost = 0.8 * $400
Materials cost = $320

Now, we need to add the cost of the materials to the cost of the materials to get the total cost.

Total cost = Materials cost + Original cost
Total cost = $320 + $400
Total cost = $720

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $720."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returns) = 50.

"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to calculate the hours for each day and add them together.

Hallie had 1 hour of dance practice on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 
So, the total hours for these two days are 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 hours. 
So, the total hours for Saturdays is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

Now, let's add the hours for all three days: 3 hours (Tuesdays and Thursdays) + 4 hours (Saturdays) = 7 hours.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces of equipment is x.

Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000, and this is the sum of the cost of the faulty pieces and the cost of the functioning pieces.

The cost of the faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The cost of the functioning pieces is 0.6x (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

We can set up the equation:

0.4x + 0.6x = 400,000

Combine like terms:

1x = 400,000

Divide both sides by 1:

x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

Total cost of functioning pieces = 0.6x

"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep in each half.

From the first half of the sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk per sheep, so she gets 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the second half of the sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk per sheep, so she gets 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine the number of apples picked on Monday and Wednesday.

Since Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and she got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Monday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total money earned / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, so she picked 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days:
Total number of apples = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months.

First, we need to calculate the total interest. The formula for simple interest is:

Total Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% or 0.10, and the time is 5 months.

Total Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Total Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan needs to pay.

Total Amount = Principal + Total Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,105

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $1,105."

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 - $18 = $18

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours:

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of the initial land is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

We can set up the equation as follows: 
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services without the discount:

- Netflix: $10 per month
- Hulu: $10 per month
- Disney Plus: $10 per month

Total cost without discount: $10 + $10 + $10 = $30 per month

Since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling, we need to calculate the discount amount:

Discount amount: 20% of $30 = 0.20 * $30 = $6

Now, let's calculate the total cost with the discount:

Total cost with discount: $30 - $6 = $24 per month

To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:

"To find out how many slices Jenny has initially, we need to add the fractions of the pizza she gave to Bill and Mark. 

First, we need to find a common denominator for 3 and 4, which is 12. 

1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we can add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, and she eats 2 slices, we need to subtract 2 from 7/12. 

To subtract 2 from 7/12, we can convert 2 to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
2 = 24/12

Now, we can subtract:
7/12 - 24/12 = -17/12

Since we can't have a negative number of slices, we can convert -17/12 to a mixed number:
-17/12 = -1 7/12

So, there is 1 slice left.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

"To find the total calories consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

Number of glasses = 2
Ounces per glass = 8
Calories per ounce = 3

Total calories = Number of glasses * Ounces per glass * Calories per ounce
Total calories = 2 * 8 * 3

John consumed 48 calories."
"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the total number of working days in a year.

There are 52 weeks in a year. Since the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of working days in a year is:
52 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 312 days/year

Since the builder works 4 weeks every month, the total number of working months in a year is:
12 months/year / 4 weeks/month = 3 months/year

The total number of working days in a year is:
312 days/year (from full-time work) + 0 days/year (from part-time work) = 312 days/year

Since the builder gets paid $50 every day, the total amount he earns in a year is:
312 days/year * $50/day = $15,600/year

The final answer is: $15,600"
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the normal recipe by 4 since he's making a quadruple batch. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the daily energy consumption is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

In 30 days, the total energy consumption is 7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily energy consumption is 7.2 kWh - (900 watts * 5 hours) = 7.2 kWh - 4500 Wh = 6.7 kWh per day.

In 30 days, the new total energy consumption is 6.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 201 kWh.

The energy saved is the difference between the original and new energy consumption: 216 kWh - 201 kWh = 15 kWh.

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to first find the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so together they have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.

The third zebra has 36 stripes.

The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes per zebra is 22."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:

- 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's say the number of corns is x. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can write the equation as:

x = 2 * 40
x = 80

So, Allan has 80 corns.

We also know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 (initial cannolis) + 60 (new cannolis) = 100 cannolis

We are also told that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's say the number of corns is y. Since he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, we can write the equation as:

y = 100 - 40
y = 60

However, we already know that the number of corns is 80. This means that the information about buying 40 fewer corns is incorrect, and we can ignore it.

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Total = 80 (corns) + 100 (cannolis)
Total = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: 4,000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total number of words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Time taken to read the book = Total number of words / Reading rate
Time taken to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words per minute
Time taken to read the book = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid in May is:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $24,000

Since the company hired 40 employees in May, the number of employees in June is 40 - 1/4 * 40 = 30 employees.

In June, the company pays each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total amount paid in June is:

30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $18,000

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is:

$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items Sally purchased. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days.

Since she eats 2 cookies per night, for 30 days, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies per dozen (12).

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
5% of 50000 candles = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Now, we need to find 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog, which will explode:
1% of 2500 candles = 0.01 * 2500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discounted price of one blouse and then multiply it by 4.

The regular price of one blouse is $20. Since the blouses are 30% off, we need to find 30% of $20 and subtract it from $20.

30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

Discounted price of one blouse = $20 - $6 = $14

Now, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost of the 4 blouses:

Total cost = $14 * 4 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as T, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as S, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as A.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30.

We also know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30/2 = 15.

We know that Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so T' = 2T = 2(30) = 60.

We also know that Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so S' = 3S = 3(15) = 45.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can set up the equation:

T + S + A = 500
30 + 15 + A = 500

Combine the constants:
45 + A = 500

Subtract 45 from both sides:
A = 455

So, Joanne gathered 455 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: 455"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have 2 bumps each and dromedaries have 1 bump each, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To find Zack's locker size, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can set up the equation:

Zack's locker = 1/2 * Timothy's locker
20 = 1/2 * Timothy's locker

To find Timothy's locker size, we multiply both sides by 2:

Timothy's locker = 20 * 2
Timothy's locker = 40 cubic inches

2. Then, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

There were 12 cats left on the rock."
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods:

   6 months * $8 per month = $48

2. The next 8 months: $12 per month
   8 months * $12 per month = $96

3. The last 8 months: $14 per month
   8 months * $14 per month = $112

Now, we add the costs of all three periods:
$48 + $96 + $112 = $256

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, which is (1/3)x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is the rest, which is (2/3)(x + 6).

Since the total savings is $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

x + 2(x + 6) = 18

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $2. 

Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is $2 + 6 = $8.

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $8 - $2 = $6.

The final answer is: 6"

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's assume that the store-bought feeders attract x birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, they attract x + 10 birds each.

We know that Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders and buys 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:

30 = 0

This equation is not true, which means that the initial assumption that the store-bought feeders attract x birds each is incorrect. However, we can still solve the problem by assuming that the store-bought feeders attract x birds each and the homemade feeders attract x + 10 birds each.

The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10) and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x. Since the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders is the same, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 10) = 3x + 30

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 30 = 3x + 30

This equation is true, which means that our initial assumption is correct. Therefore, the store-bought feeders attract x birds each and the homemade feeders attract x + 10 birds each.

Since we know that each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 20

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

10 = 20 - x

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get:

-10 = -x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So, the store-bought feeders attract 10 birds each and the homemade feeders attract 20 birds each.

The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(20) = 60 and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3(10) = 30.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 30 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Kenny has in total. We know that he has $50 in spending cash and he also gets to keep 1/3 of the cards, which means he gets 1/3 of the money from selling the cards. Let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. 

Since Kenny sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 1.5x. He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells 2/3 of the cards. The amount of money he gets from selling 2/3 of the cards is 2/3 * 1.5x = 1x.

We know that the total amount of money Kenny has is $100, which is the sum of the money he has in spending cash and the money he gets from selling the cards. So, we can set up the equation:

1x + 50 = 100

Subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation, we get:

1x = 50

Dividing both sides by 1, we get:

x = 50

So, Kenny starts with 50 cards. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who got two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, there is a shortage of 80 - 36 = 44 hotdogs.

The number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the shortage, which is 44.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can assume that 1% of his total money is 1 cent. This means he spent 99% of his money, which is 99 cents.

Now, we know that George spent 120 cents on chips and 99 cents on candy bars. The total amount he spent is 120 + 99 = 219 cents.

Since George spent 5 dollars, we can convert this to cents: 5 * 100 = 500 cents.

Now, we can find out how much money George had initially: 500 - 219 = 281 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can find the initial amount of money he had: 281 * 100 = 28.1 dollars.

Now, we can find out how many candy bars George bought: 28.1 - 3 * 0.40 = 28.1 - 1.2 = 26.9. 

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to 26 candy bars.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4). 

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

5"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends. 

Total number of people = 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56

Now, we divide the total oranges by the total number of people: 
56 / 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then find out how much earlier she should leave.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, we know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette should arrive 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 - 9 = 7 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of beads each sister has. To do this, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The difference in the number of beads between the two sisters is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus spends 3 hours baking. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open, and it's open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the window is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window. The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase due to oven - Temperature decrease due to window
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
James' swim time: 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

Jon's bike time: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
James' bike time: 80 + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Jon's run time: 50 minutes
James' run time: We don't know yet, but we'll call it x minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. We can set up an equation:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + x - 10

Combine like terms:
170 = 111 + x

Subtract 111 from both sides:
59 = x

So, James' run time is 59 minutes.

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total distance the horse runs, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

Time in hours = 30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Distance = Speed * Time = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:

Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30. 

Change = $30 - $24 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of eggs Rozanne has, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find the number of glasses. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find the number of trays. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to compare his final score to Marcy's final score.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

Six packets had eight colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had sixteen colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

112"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of the popcorn as P and the price of the soda as S.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket. 

The cost of the super ticket is $20, so the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12, so the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $18 - $12 = $6.

We know that the soda costs $3, so the cost of the popcorn is $6 - $3 = $3.

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since 20 balloons cost $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

45 + 20 = 65

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost of one balloon by 170:

65 * 170 = 11,100

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,100 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Initially, Jenna had 8 sapphires worth $800. After trading 3 sapphires, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the remaining sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna received 2 rubies worth $1200 each, so the total value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of all her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten, we need to multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

Marin eats 4 apples per day, and Nancy eats 4 apples per day.

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to calculate the volume of each bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of each bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the number of red cards and add it to the number of red cards.

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new ones) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12).

- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips: 3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. To do this, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students, we can start by using the information that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. 

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer. 

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books:

300 / 15 = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4:

20 / 4 = 5

So, each child got 5 books."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances (dairy or peanuts). 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this. 

Number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
Number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Number of kids allergic to both = 3

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts to avoid double counting.

Number of kids allergic to at least one substance = (Number of kids allergic to dairy) + (Number of kids allergic to peanuts) - (Number of kids allergic to both)
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to at least one substance
= 32 - 12

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. The increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To find out how many songs Luri has, we need to multiply the number of songs Gabriel has by 3. 

Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Since Gabriel can add up to 100 songs, and Luri already has 60 songs, the number of songs Luri can add is 100 - 60 = 40.

The difference between the number of songs Gabriel can add and the number of songs Luri can add is 100 - 40 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60 oranges.

2/5 of 60 oranges = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5

"To find the total hours James runs per week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide it by his speed.

Total miles per week = miles per day * days per week
Total miles per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
Total miles per week = 60 miles/week

Now, we can find the total hours he runs per week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
Total hours per week = Total miles per week / speed
Total hours per week = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours per week = 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds his horses twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for 5 days. This is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we can divide the total amount of oats needed (200 pounds) by the amount in each bag (50 pounds) to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs:

200 / 50 = 4

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Pomeranians: 
   Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we multiply the total number of puppies by 2/3.
   Total puppies = 27
   Pomeranians = 27 * (2/3) = 18

2. Calculate the number of girl Pomeranians:
   Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we multiply the number of Pomeranians by 1/3.
   Girl Pomeranians = 18 * (1/3) = 6

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

Remaining amount = Total cost of the toy - Amount he already has
Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount to find out how many days it will take.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily savings
Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

The child will take 4 days to save the remaining amount and buy the toy.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors.

Since the razors come 4 to a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

The original price of 2 packs is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, the total cost of 2 packs will be $8.00.

However, Heather also has a $2.00 coupon. So, the final cost will be $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Since there are 8 razors in 2 packs, the cost per razor will be $6.00 / 8 = $0.75.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.75 * 100 = 75 cents.

The final answer is 75."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. So, the height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer consists of 3 girls standing on top of the 4. Since the shortest girl is 60"", the height of this layer is 3 * (64"" + 60"") = 3 * 124"" = 372"".

The top layer consists of 2 girls standing on top of the 3. The height of this layer is 2 * (64"" + 60"") = 2 * 124"" = 248"".

Now, we add the heights of all the layers together: 256"" + 372"" + 248"" = 876"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 876"" / 12 = 73 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Angela's current age as 'A'. 

Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we can set up the equation:

A + 4 = 3 * 14

Simplifying the equation:
A + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides:
A = 38

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find the total number of oranges, we need to calculate the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to this, we get 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The length of the couch is 18 feet."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of a pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for these packs would be 2x.

She also bought 1 pack of grape gum for $2 and 1 pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 2 + 1 = 7

Combine the constants:
2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:
2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 2

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

For 2 x 4 lumber:
Cost per stick = Total cost / Total sticks
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 lumber:
Cost per stick = Total cost / Total sticks
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.015 per stick

Since 2 x 8 lumber is cheaper per stick, Frederick should buy 2 x 8 lumber. 

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of 2 x 8 lumber he can buy with $24:
Number of 2 x 8 lumber = Total budget / Cost per 2 x 8 lumber
Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6
Number of 2 x 8 lumber = 4

Total sticks from 4 2 x 8 lumber = 4 * 400 sticks
Total sticks = 1600 sticks

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2 per week.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120

"To determine the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total number of days he has to lose 30 pounds.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. So, the number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:

December (31 days) + January (31 days) + February (28 days) + March (31 days) + April (30 days) + May (31 days) + June (30 days) + July (19 days) = 231 days

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories to lose 30 pounds. To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Number of days
= 3500 calories / 231 days
= approximately 15.1 calories per day

So, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 15.1 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."

Combined rate = 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 house per day

Since we want to paint a whole house, we need to find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint the whole house:

Time = 1 house / (1/2 house per day) = 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the time to hours:

Time (in hours) = 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

Final answer: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. 

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. 

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since they have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs. 

Now, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs together: 20 (sofas) + 66 (chairs) = 86.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 86."
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to first find out how much he spent on the CD.

Tom spent $48 in total and $4 on the CD. So, the amount he spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. Since each CD costs $4, we can divide $44 by $4 to get the number of CDs.

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours for the weeks he worked 4 hours, the weeks he worked 5 hours, and the week he worked 6 hours.

For the weeks he worked 4 hours, there were 6 weeks. 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

For the week he worked 5 hours, there was 1 week.
1 week * 5 hours/week = 5 hours

For the week he worked 6 hours, there was 1 week.
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add the hours from all the weeks together.
24 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 35 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 35 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus. The total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.

The final answer is: 66"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:
Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the two monitors:
Cost of two monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Cost of two monitors = $2,400 - $700
Cost of two monitors = $1,700

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of two monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of two monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

The final answer is: $850"
"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first find the total number of seashells brought by the girls. 

Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 20 kids in total, the number of boys is half of 20, which is 10. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

Since George has 3 candies left after eating 5, we can find out how many candies he had initially by adding 5 to 3. 

George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies initially.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can multiply the initial number of candies George had by 2 to find out how many candies Nick had.

Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is 16."
"To find Anne's age, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Chenny is 10 years old.
2. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.
3. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed: 72

Number of vlogs left to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

Final answer: $39"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings for the first half of the month.

Daily savings for the first half of the month = $1125 / 15 (15 days in the first half of April) = $75

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

Daily savings for the second half of the month = $75 * 2 = $150

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of the month to hit his target."
"To find the total cost of the items Verna bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of the apples is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50
The cost of the oranges is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00
The cost of the peaches is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50

The total cost of the items is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, we multiply x by 4:

Jeff's amount = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys he needs for his play set. Since his set needs to be five times larger than James's set, we multiply the number of toys in James's set by 5.

James's set has 80 toys, so Jonathan's set needs 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 400, where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

For sales up to $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For sales over $1000, the commission is 10% of the amount over $1000, which is $1500. 
First, we need to find 10% of $1500:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the commission for sales up to $1000 and the commission for sales over $1000:
$300 + $150 = $450

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply 70 by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100). The total number of pages she read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. The total amount of money Sharon received so far is $5.00 + $3.00 = $8.00.
4. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can use the information given.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Anna as A, the number of goals scored by Mark as M, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: R = M + 20.

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation: R = A + 45.

Since we know that Richie scored 80 goals, we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation: 80 = M + 20.

Solving for M, we get M = 80 - 20 = 60.

Now that we know M, we can substitute M = 60 into the second equation: 80 = A + 45.

Solving for A, we get A = 80 - 45 = 35.

Now that we know A and M, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers: A + M + R = 35 + 60 + 80 = 175.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 per day for 3 days, so he spent a total of:
3 * $5 = $15

He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will spend $2 per day for 3 days, so he will spend a total of:
3 * $2 = $6

He has $55 left, so he will spend $6, leaving him with:
$55 - $6 = $49

Since the plastic action figures cost $2 each, he can buy:
$49 / $2 = 24.5

Since you can't buy half a figure, we round down to 24 plastic action figures.

Now, let's add the wooden and plastic action figures:
24 (plastic) + 3 (wooden) = 27

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he needs to supply in a month and then subtract the total number of roses he grows in a month.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. 

Ford grows 40 roses per week. 
Total roses in a month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week. 
Total roses from the first shop in a month = 20 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 80 roses/month

The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week. 
Total roses from the second shop in a month = 15 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 60 roses/month

The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 
Total roses from the third shop in a month = 30 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 120 roses/month

Total roses needed in a month = 80 roses/month + 60 roses/month + 120 roses/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's subtract the total roses Ford grows in a month from the total roses needed in a month to find out how many roses he lacks. 
Roses lacking = Total roses needed - Total roses grown 
Roses lacking = 260 roses/month - 160 roses/month 
Roses lacking = 100 roses/month

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:

$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract this amount from the initial amount in her savings account:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

Final answer: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue, total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost of bread = Number of loaves of bread * Cost per loaf
Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches is 1 loaf.
Total cost of bread = 1 loaf * $3.00 per loaf
Total cost of bread = $3.00

Total cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Total cost of bread + Total cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first find out how many crayons she has in total. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

Now that we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin to find out how much money she can make.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room, then calculate the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 (carpet) + $432 (padding) + $864 (removal) + $7344 (installation) = $10092.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

Let's calculate the total number of birds:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
Average = Total number of birds / Number of days
Average = 280 / 7
Average = 40

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations in the correct order.

1. The starting value is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value (30) is divided by 5: 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value (6) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, let's add the number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 

To find the percentage, we divide the error by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find the temperature that is 4% more than 520. 

To do this, we multiply 520 by 1.04 (which is 100% + 4%): 
520 * 1.04 = 540

So, Maggie should set her oven to 540 degrees. 

540"
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

Final answer: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's calculate the combined value of the two houses:
Combined value = Herb's house value + Juan's house value
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200
Combined value = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 = 0.1 * $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = Total cost / Total pairs
= $180.00 / 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Now, we multiply the number of times she needs to drink water by the amount of water she needs per time.

8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the blue jelly beans, so we can write:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue jelly beans, so we can write:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"

"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex and the number of people she invited her friends to bring.

Alex invited 100 people.
Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of additional people invited is 100 * 2 = 200.
Alex also invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of additional people invited by her friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited by Alex and the number of people invited by her friends: 100 + 200 + 18 = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall. It is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall. It is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall. Now it is taller than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the amount of protein he gets per day by multiplying the weight of mushrooms by the amount of protein per cup.

200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to find the weekly amount.

600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 

The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

The second angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees.

The third angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * 60
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The original price of the shorts is $35. 
Price of the shorts after discount = $35

Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax first. 
Sales tax rate is not given, but we can assume it's 8% for this example. 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

The total cost of John's research is $2,077,625."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and then add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).
The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the team:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of days in March. March has 31 days.

Since each member posts 3 posts per day, we multiply the number of members by the number of posts per day and then by the number of days in March.

Total posts in March = 1000 members * 3 posts/member * 31 days
Total posts in March = 1000 * 3 * 31
Total posts in March = 93,000

The final answer is: 93,000"
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year, and finally multiply by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he uses 2 * 20 gallons = 40 gallons per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total gallons of water used per year is 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons/year.

The cost of water per gallon is $0.15, so the total cost per year is 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to first calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:
15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg/day

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the entire bull:
750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row: 
4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so the number of seats occupied by administrators is:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents is:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students is:
54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. Next, we add the gum he chews on the way home from school and after dinner. This is 1 piece + 1 piece = 2 pieces.

3. Now, we add the gum he chews at school and the way home from school and after dinner. 4 + 2 = 6 pieces.

4. Since Jim has a 20 pack of gum, we subtract the 6 pieces he chewed from the total. 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

5. Finally, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Jim gives to his sister. Since he gives half of the remaining gum, we divide 14 by 2. 14 / 2 = 7.

6. Now, we subtract the gum he gave to his sister from the remaining gum. 14 - 7 = 7.

So, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. 

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second: 
20 kb/second / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 
Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour: 
0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

Current height: 40 inches
Required height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Now, let's calculate the difference:
48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we'll divide the difference by his growth rate:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The cost of the cars is $25,000 each, and the company paid 30% of that price. 
30% of $25,000 is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500. 
So, the company paid $7,500 for each car, and James got to keep the remaining amount, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Now, James gets a 10% commission on the profit. 
10% of $17,500 is 0.1 * $17,500 = $1,750.

Therefore, James made $1,750."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can calculate the number of women who can stay upright as follows:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate it as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of truck stamps and rose stamps Max bought.

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that S = 16.

We also know that T = S + 3, and R = T - 9.

Substituting S = 16 into the equation T = S + 3, we get T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Substituting T = 19 into the equation R = T - 9, we get R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are looking for the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we need a positive relative speed. We can achieve this by taking the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph |
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. 

Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class).

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $60
Total cost of classes = $600

Since his parents won't sign him up again if the total cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the total cost exceeds $600.

Let's assume he misses 'x' classes. The total cost will be:
Total cost = (10 - x) * $60 (since he can't miss more than 10 classes)

We want to find the maximum value of 'x' such that the total cost is less than or equal to $600.

(10 - x) * $60 ≤ $600
(10 - x) ≤ $600 / $60
(10 - x) ≤ 10
10 - x ≤ 10
-x ≤ 0
x ≥ 0

Since 'x' represents the number of classes, it cannot be negative. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 0.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, we can set up an equation: Reggie's distance + 3 = Lynn's distance.

Now, we can substitute Reggie's distance (20 miles) into the equation: 20 + 3 = Lynn's distance.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 23 = Lynn's distance.

Therefore, Lynn ran 23 miles.

Time to dig through soil = Distance / Rate = 24 / 4 = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay:
Distance of clay = 8 feet
Rate of digging through clay = 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour (since he digs half as fast through clay)
Time to dig through clay = Distance / Rate = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay

"To find the initial number of likes, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. 

Since the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes, we can write the equation as:

x + 2000 + 20000 = 70x

Combine like terms:

20000 + 2000 = 70x - x
22000 = 69x

Now, divide both sides by 69:

x = 22000 / 69
x = 319.45 (round down to 319 since we can't have a fraction of a like)

Now that we know the initial number of likes, we can find the total number of likes. 

Total likes = Initial likes + 2000 + 20000
Total likes = 319 + 2000 + 20000
Total likes = 23219

$2 discount = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost on Wednesday is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$60 discount = $600 - $60 = $540

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales from red hats in the first month would be G/2.

We know that the total sales from red hats in the first month is $400, so we can set up the equation:

G/2 = 400

To find the total sales from green hats in the first month, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

Now, we know that in the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. The total sales of the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is 400 + 800 = 1200.

The sales in the second month would be 3/4 of 1200:

(3/4) * 1200 = 900

Now, we need to find the total amount she made in two months. This is the sum of the sales from both months:

Total sales = 400 + 800 + 900
Total sales = 2100

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Subtract the current bank balance from the expected wage:
$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's bank account was overdrawn by $120. This implies that $120 was withheld from her wage.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.

Total eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate 2/3 of the total number of pages in the paper.

Total number of pages = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 * 15 = 5 pages

Pages left to write = Total number of pages - Pages already written
= 15 - 5

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total number of pages = 200
Number of pages read per day = 10

Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Number of days before the deadline = Total number of days - Number of days to finish the book
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost, and then multiply each by 12.

The cost of the plane itself is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000, so the annual rent is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, so the monthly fuel cost is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. The annual fuel cost is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the annual rent, and the annual fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cooking time for the pork and then the beans. 

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of animal heads is 20, so we can set up the equation:

s + g = 20 (since each animal has one head)

We also know that the total number of animal legs is 70. Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can set up the equation:

4s + 2g = 70

Now we have a system of two equations:

s + g = 20
4s + 2g = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2s + 2g = 40
4s + 2g = 70
-------------------
2s = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

s = 15

Now that we know the number of sheep, we can find the number of geese by substituting s into one of the original equations:

15 + g = 20
g = 5

So, Lee has 15 sheep and 5 geese on his farm.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately and then add them together.

First, we need to find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since it costs 20% more than the normal brand, we can calculate it as follows:

Cost of the more expensive brand = Cost of the normal brand + (20% of the cost of the normal brand)
= $5 + (0.20 * $5)
= $5 + $1
= $6 per pound

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 days, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day, the total cost of the coffee is:

Total cost of coffee = 7 days * $6 per pound
= 7 * $6
= $42

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is:

Total cost = Total cost of coffee + Cost of the donut
= $42 + $2
= $44

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:
- 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each: 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
- Bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- Bottle of soda for $1.00
Total cost of items: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (total cost of items) = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find the number of newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: 193"
"To find the total number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class and then divide that by the number of hours it takes to learn a new recipe.

Total class time = 4 classes/week * 2 hours/class = 8 hours/week
Total class time for 6 weeks = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Since John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, we can divide the total class time by 1.5 to find the number of recipes he learns:
Number of recipes = Total class time / 1.5
= 48 hours / 1.5
= 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers.

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we multiply 40% by the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping.

60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 regular quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, so 4 quarters would be 4 x 12 = 48 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate the number of management employees first. 

20% of 50 employees are management, so we multiply 50 by 0.2 to get the number of management employees: 
50 * 0.2 = 10

Now, out of these 10 management employees, 30% oversee the entire company. We multiply 10 by 0.3 to get the number of employees who oversee the company:
10 * 0.3 = 3

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of candy, we need to add the amount of candy each person had. 

Robert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. 
Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they want to share the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total amount by 3 (the number of people).

12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds

So, each person will have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days in the month. 

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the total number of days as follows:

- Good days: 12 (first 8) + 3 (next 3) = 15
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: 8

Total days = 15 (good) + 8 (bad) + 8 (neutral) = 31

Since there are 31 days in the month, we can now find the number of good days left:

Total good days = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

9"
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide 600 by 30.

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

Therefore, it will take 20 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs became 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys initially. However, he only had 4 toys, so he had to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

When he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so the total number of dogs became 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.

However, 3 dogs were gone, so the total number of dogs became 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

"To find the amount of Skyler's investment, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the amount Dylan invested: 
   Dylan's investment = 2/5 of the total amount
   Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200
   Dylan's investment = 480

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:
   Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
   Remaining amount = 1200 - 480
   Remaining amount = 720

3. Next, we find the amount Frances invested:
   Frances' investment = 2/3 of the remaining amount
   Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720
   Frances' investment = 480

4. Finally, we find the amount Skyler invested by subtracting Frances' investment from the remaining amount:
   Skyler's investment = Remaining amount - Frances' investment
   Skyler's investment = 720 - 480
   Skyler's investment = 240

"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes required to make 36 hash browns.

Number of hash browns per 6 potatoes = 36
Number of potatoes per hash brown = 6
Number of hash browns per 1 potato = 36 / 6 = 6

Now, let's find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:
Number of hash browns = 96 / 1 = 96

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 96 hash browns.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally add up the number of cookies each person has.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total:

Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's total:

Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to Max's total:

Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now that we know the number of cookies each person has, we can add them up to find the total number of cookies:

Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

There is also a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. We can try different values of y and see if we can find a corresponding integer value of x.

Let's try y = 4:

2x + 3(4) = 2x + 12 = 34

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 22

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 11

So, the age of the younger twin is 11 years.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to calculate the total number of months he has been saving. Since there are 12 months in a year, Rong has been saving for 10 years * 12 months/year = 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so the total number of coins he has saved is 20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins.

Now, let's calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 coins/month + (2/5 * 20 coins/month) = 20 coins/month + 8 coins/month = 28 coins/month.

The total number of months Neil has been saving is also 120 months. So, the total number of coins Neil has saved is 28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have saved together, we add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved: 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

The total number of squares is 68.

The comforter is 1-foot by 1-foot, so the total area is 68 square feet.

"To find the number of regular chairs, we need to multiply the number of high chairs by 5, since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.

Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5 = 40

Total number of people attending = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57

Since the total number of people is 57, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs needed is 57 - 8 = 49.

Number of regular chairs needed = 49

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of regular chairs she already has from the number of regular chairs needed.

Number of regular chairs needed - Number of regular chairs already available = 49 - 40 = 9

Mia needs to get 9 more regular chairs."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. 
To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the threshold: 
400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account:
50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment:
20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, let's subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck:
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend.

Final answer: $720"
"To find the number of pencils in the box, we need to subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity of the box. 

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Since we are asked to find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 (total pencils) / 2 = 8 pairs of pencils

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city display and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city display:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300:
0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city display and her backyard:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of people, drinks, and snacks.

There are 12 friends initially, and 7 more friends join them, making a total of 12 + 7 = 19 people.

Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks consumed is 19 * 2 = 38 drinks, and the total number of snacks consumed is 19 * 3 = 57 snacks.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76, and the total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the weight that Gissela's truck can carry as G, Gordy's truck as G + 800, and Gary's truck as G + 800 + x, where x is the weight that Gary's truck can carry.

We know that the total weight the three trucks can carry together is 11,600 pounds. So, we can set up the equation:

G + (G + 800) + (G + 800 + x) = 11,600

Combine like terms:

3G + 1600 + x = 11,600

Subtract 1600 from both sides:

3G + x = 10,000

Now, we know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. So, we can substitute G = 4,000 into the equation:

3(4,000) + x = 10,000

Multiply 3 by 4,000:

12,000 + x = 10,000

Subtract 12,000 from both sides:

x = -2,000

However, the weight that a truck can carry cannot be negative. This means that our initial assumption about the weights of the trucks was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the information given. We know that Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. So, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we can set up the equation:

G + (G + 800) + (G + 800 + x) = 11,600

Substitute G = 4,000:

4,000 + 4,800 + (4,000 + 800 + x) = 11,600

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many dumplings the males ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is also 50.

"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5.

Since Gerald spent $10, we can set up an equation to find out how much money he had initially. Let's assume Gerald's share is 3x. 

3x = 3/5 of the total amount
3x = (3/5) * 100
3x = 60
x = 20

So Gerald had $60 initially. 

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount:
$60 - $10 = $50

Gerald had $50 left.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first find out how much they still need to raise. 

They have already raised $2100, and their goal is $6300. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they are raising an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked (3 hours) to find out how much they raise per hour.

$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour

Now, we can divide the remaining amount ($4200) by the amount they raise per hour ($1400) to find out how many more hours they need to work.

$4200 / $1400 = 3 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 3 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because the city can't use a negative percentage of the river's water.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If 80% of the 40% is used for industrial purposes, that means 20% of the 40% is used for non-industrial purposes. 

20% of 40% = 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08 or 8%

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is 8."

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream per hour and then multiply it by the number of hours.

For chocolate ice cream, the production rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the production rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The total cost of the croissants is 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
The total cost of the cinnamon rolls is 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount. 10% of $50.00 is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, and she gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she buys, we can calculate the cost of 3 scoops as follows:

3 scoops = 2 scoops (cost) + 1 scoop (free)
Cost of 3 scoops = 2 x $1.50 = $3.00

Since Erin has $6.00, she can afford 3 scoops.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the number of mosaic tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of the total square footage of the bathroom. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we multiply the area to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles per square foot (24).

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65.

The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price.

Total amount paid = Number of computers * New price of each computer
= 500 * $770
= $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply it by the number of minutes.

Scenario 1: Both hands at her sides
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute
- Total taps per minute = 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

Scenario 2: Arms raised
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute
- Total taps per minute = 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total, with her arms raised for 2 minutes. 
- Time with arms raised = 2 minutes
- Time with arms down = 5 - 2 = 3 minutes

Total taps with arms raised = 2 * 400 = 800 taps
Total taps with arms down = 3 * 550 = 1650 taps

Total taps = 800 + 1650 = 2450 taps

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole himself includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council (which is $0 since he's fixing it himself). 

The cost of the asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75. 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $75 = $375.

Therefore, Ron saves $375 by fixing the pothole himself.

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2/3 * 2 = 4/3 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 4/3 * 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate ¾ * 2 = 1 ½ pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1 ½ * 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all the friends: 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26.

"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 20 minutes, we can say the dog eats 9 sausages in 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 
The average time is the sum of the individual times divided by 2. 
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are given that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars:

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4 pieces).

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days. 

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To find out how many smores the kids will eat, multiply the number of kids by the number of smores each kid wants: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores.

To find out how many smores the adults will eat, multiply the number of adults by the number of smores each adult wants: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores.

Now, add the total number of smores the kids and adults will eat: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, divide the total number of smores needed by the number of smores per sleeve: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the number of boxes needed is equal to the number of sleeves needed: 3 sleeves/box = 3 boxes.

"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Combined age = Dora's age + father's age + mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34

"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find the number of students per group. 
Total students = 54
Number of groups = 6

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
= 54 / 6

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

"To solve this problem, we can use the information that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. 

Since the total number of council members is 33, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation would be 2x (twice the number of votes against it). 

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the amount after the discount, we need to calculate 5% of the marked price and subtract it from the marked price.

5% of $140 = 0.05 * 140 = $7

"To find the total number of hours the playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist and then multiply that by the length of each song.

Number of playlists: 20
Number of songs in each playlist: 300
Length of each song: 10 hours

Total number of songs: 20 * 300 = 6000
Total hours: 6000 * 10 = 60,000 hours

The 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total."
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. We can set up the equation: 
1/3 * P = 6

To find P, we multiply both sides by 3:
P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as T. We can set up the equation:
2/3 * T = 18

To find T, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
T = 18 * (3/2)
T = 27

So Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has ($70) to the money Ava gave him ($45):

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200, so we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the total 250 cases, we can calculate it as follows:
1/2 * 250 = 125 cases

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so we multiply the amount the first house needs by 2:
125 * 2 = 250 cases

Therefore, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

Final answer: 250"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas he has and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. 

Number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the ball. 

Initial amount of money Marissa had: $80
Cost of the ball: $20
Amount of money left: $80 - $20 = $60

Since the candy bars are sold at $5 each, we can divide the amount of money left by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many Marissa bought.

Number of candy bars = Amount of money left / Cost of each candy bar
= $60 / $5
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we need to first find out how many kilograms of oranges are required for 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

The cost of 1 kilogram of oranges is $3. Therefore, the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges will be 20 * $3 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total number of books read, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find the number of books Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books initially and decided to read 150 more, so the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we can divide 450 by 2 to find the number of books Ahmed read: 450 / 2 = 225.

To find the total number of books read, we add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed: 450 (Ezra) + 225 (Ahmed) = 675.

The final answer is: 675"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours * $15 per hour = 4 * 5 * 15 = $60

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = 2 * 2 * 15 = $60

However, Tanya also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the additional $5. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the additional $5.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days:
$60 (Monday) + $60 (Wednesday) = $120

Tanya's total earnings for these two days of teaching is $120.

"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 (vanilla) - 16 (fruity) = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he earns from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he earns from eggplants is:
20 * 3 = $60

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he earns from eggplants from the total amount:
$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn he has to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for:
$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, the total time taken for the round trip = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total time taken for the round trip = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum, the total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 * (1/3) = 200 movies in series.

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract this from the total:
600 - 200 = 400 movies remaining.

Step 3: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate this as:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, we can calculate this as:
200 * 6 = $1200.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate this as:
160 * 5 = $800.

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the remaining movies.
Since the remaining movies are normal movies, we can calculate this as:
400 * 10 = $4000.

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
We add up the costs of all the movies:
$1200 + $800 + $4000 = $5000.

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their driving speed as follows:
Driving speed = 50 mph
Half of the driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 mph
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 mph

Now, we know the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours) and their hiking speed (20 mph). We can use the formula:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the three usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 times.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes: 9 + 6 = 15 times.

Since there are 5 days in total, we multiply the total number of times by 5: 15 * 5 = 75 times.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish after the purchase would be 2x.

We know that the total number of fish initially was 7, so the number of white fish initially was 4. The number of orange fish initially was 3. 

The total number of fish after the purchase is 7 + x (the number of white fish he bought) + 17 (the number of fish he bought from the pet store). 

Since the number of orange fish after the purchase is 2x, we can set up the equation:

3 + 17 = 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 10

So, Bob bought 10 white fish at the pet store.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy travels to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles. So, the round-trip distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.

The total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week by dividing the total distance by the fuel efficiency:

Fuel consumption per week = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumption per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Fuel consumption per week = 5 gallons

Since the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, the total cost of fuel consumption per week is:

Total cost per week = Fuel consumption per week * Price per gallon
Total cost per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Total cost per week = $15

"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in temperature between the day and night, and then divide that by the temperature increase per log.

The temperature difference between day and night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of each log to find the number of logs needed:

12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough to prevent the pipes from freezing. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to eliminate the fraction:

1 = 0.3(14 + x)

Now, distribute 0.3 to 14 + x:

1 = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 4.2 from both sides:

-3.2 = 0.3x

Divide both sides by 0.3:

-10.67 = x

Since we can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can round to the nearest whole number because we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal.

-10.67 ≈ -11

However, since we can't have a negative number of stuffed animals, we need to re-evaluate the problem. 

Let's re-evaluate the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

We can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to eliminate the fraction:

1 = 0.3(14 + x)

Now, distribute 0.3 to 14 + x:

1 = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 4.2 from both sides:

-3.2 = 0.3x

Divide both sides by 0.3:

-10.67 = x

Since we can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that the percentage is at least 30%.

-10.67 ≈ -11

However, since we can't have a negative number of stuffed animals, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

We can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to eliminate the fraction:

1 = 0.3(14 + x)

Now, distribute 0.3 to 14 + x:

1 = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 4.2 from both sides:

-3.2 = 0.3x

Divide both sides by 0.3:

-10.67 = x

Since we can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that the percentage is at least 30%.

x ≈ 11

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. 
14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 7 days. 
7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. 
30 - 21 = 9 hours

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 2
Distance = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will cover a distance of:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 * 2
Distance = 140 miles

Since the second car is traveling faster, it will be ahead of the first car. To find the distance between them, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car:
Distance between them = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
Distance between them = 140 - 120
Distance between them = 20 miles

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the diamond and the gold separately, then add the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600.
The cost of the gold is $300.

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total amount James paid is the cost of the diamond and gold plus the premium, which is $900 + $270 = $1170.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

The number of third-graders who passed is 340, and the number of fourth-graders who passed is 40. 

The number of fifth-graders who passed is twice the number of fourth-graders who passed, so it is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed: 
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

The total number of students in the school is 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
(460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The school's overall pass rate is 46%."
"To find the total number of square inches that Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we need to first find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we can divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches in one bag: 
72 / 12 = 6 square inches per bag.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches per bag by 2: 
6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long the mosaic can be. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and Milo has 12 square inches, we can divide 12 by 12 to find the length of the mosaic: 
12 / 12 = 1 inch.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Initially, Dale had 100 candies.
He sold 150 candies, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies (this means he actually doesn't have 50 candies left, but rather he is in a deficit of 50 candies).
Then, he ordered 100 more candies, so now he has 100 - 50 + 100 = 150 candies.

Since he wants to sell all the candies, we need to subtract the number of candies he already has from the total number of candies he wants to sell. 
He wants to sell 100 candies, but he already has 150, so he doesn't need to sell any more candies.

"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles from 10 to 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles from 20 to 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles from 40 to 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles from 80 to 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles from 160 to 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional number of students, we subtract 10 from 320.

320 - 10 = 310

"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 1 * 5 = 5 petals
- 1 * 6 = 6 petals
- 1 * 4 = 4 petals
- 1 * 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:
101 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To find out how many S'mores they can make, we first need to calculate the total number of marshmallows used and subtract that from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

Total marshmallows in the bag = 35
Total marshmallows used by John and DeSean = 9 + 9 = 18
Total marshmallows dropped on the ground = 3
Total marshmallows left in the bag = 35 - 18 - 3 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2 (since there are two kids).

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's assume the cost per game is $0.25 (1 quarter).

Jack plays for 20 minutes, which is 1/3 of an hour. 
His friend who is significantly worse plays for 20/2 = 10 minutes, which is 1/6 of an hour.
The friend who is significantly better plays for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes, which is 1/2 of an hour.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. 
We can set up an equation to represent the total time played:
(1/3) + (1/6) + (1/2) + x = 240

To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator, which is 6. 
(2/6) + (1/6) + (3/6) + x = 240
Combine the fractions:
(6/6) + x = 240
6 + x = 240
x = 234

So, Jack's friend who is significantly better played for 234 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
Jack played for 20 minutes, so he played 20/60 = 1/3 of the games.
His friend who is significantly worse played for 10 minutes, so he played 10/60 = 1/6 of the games.
His friend who is significantly better played for 30 minutes, so he played 30/60 = 1/2 of the games.

The total number of games played is 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/2 = 1. 
Since the total number of games is 1, we can assume that each game costs $0.25.

The total cost is 1 * $0.25 = $0.25.

The final answer is: $0.25"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
2. Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
3. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
4. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Now, we can substitute the values from the first three equations into the fourth equation:
S + O + F + Z + G = 10
S + O + F + S + S = 10 (since S = G and Z = F)
2S + O + F + S = 10
3S + O + F = 10

Now, we can substitute the value of F from the first equation (Z = F) into the equation above:
3S + O + Z = 10
3S + O + S = 10 (since Z = F)
4S + O = 10

We also know that O = 2S, so we can substitute this value into the equation above:
4S + 2S = 10
6S = 10

Now, we can solve for S:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

So, Tanya uses 10/3 ounces of oil.

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 8 cars. Then, he gives away 16 cars to his mother, leaving him with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity.

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Now, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Number of students = 20

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot.

During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, he realized that 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we need to calculate 1/2 of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35.

Now, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference:
88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins.

The difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food is 52."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards that PJ has as x. 

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, which is equivalent to 1/12 of a foot (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1/12 = 1 foot.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 1 = 4 feet.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 4 = 40 feet.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the fact that the distance traveled by the kangaroos is the same as the distance traveled by the turtles. We can set up an equation using the speed of the kangaroo and the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 108 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 27 hours

However, since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance.

Time = 2 * 27 hours
Time = 54 hours

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

We also know that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she also received $150 for her part-time job. Her mom is also giving her $80. So, the total amount she has is the sum of these three amounts.

Let's denote the amount Erika has in her purse as 'x'. We know that the total amount she has is $400 (from the trade-in) + $150 (from her job) + $80 (from her mom) + x (the amount in her purse). 

We also know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has should be equal to $600 (the price of the laptop). 

We can set up the equation: 
400 + 150 + 80 + x = 600

Combine the constants: 
630 + x = 600

Subtract 630 from both sides: 
x = -30

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as Erika can't have a negative amount of money. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

The correct equation should be:
400 + 150 + 80 + x = 600

Combine the constants: 
630 + x = 600

Subtract 630 from both sides: 
x = -30

This is still not correct. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct equation should be:
400 + x = 600 - 50 (since she only needs $50 more)

Subtract 50 from 600: 
550 + x = 400

Subtract 550 from both sides: 
x = -150

This is still not correct. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

The correct equation should be:
400 + x = 600 - 50 (since she only needs $50 more)

"To find out how many apple slices Adam has initially, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the current 3 cows produce.

Current milk production: 3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs to increase the production by 10 liters (25 - 15 = 10 liters).

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs to increase the number of cows by 2 to produce 10 liters more (10 / 5 = 2).

Therefore, the farmer needs 3 + 2 = 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of the glue sticks that are used and then subtract that from the total length of the glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, let's find the length of the glue sticks that are used:
- The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
- The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
- The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used:
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 millimeters.
The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many socks and dishes Jack and Peter have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Jack has 30 socks.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60

So, Peter has 60 socks.

Now, we know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. To find the number of dishes Peter has, we can divide 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Peter has 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes they have.

Total = 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes)
Total = 60 + 30 + 30 + 60
Total = 180

Time taken by each group = 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting the stage) 
Time taken by each group = 10 minutes

Now, we need to subtract the time taken by each group from the total time of the concert. The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is equal to 120 minutes.

Total time of the concert = 120 minutes
Time taken by each group = 10 minutes
Number of groups that can perform = Total time of the concert / Time taken by each group

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in both farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year.

Total amount spent per year: $2640
Number of pairs purchased per year: 2

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs purchased per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 x $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54. However, you get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the actual cost of the red food is $54 - (3 x $2) = $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

Final answer: $123"
"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is half of 90 rooms.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S.

2. I am three years younger than my brother, so A = B - 3.

3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so A = S + 2.

4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so M = 3B - 1.

5. The sum of our ages is 87, so A + B + S + M = 87.

Now, we can substitute the expressions for A, B, and M from the previous equations into the equation for the sum of our ages:

(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5B - 8 = 87

Add 8 to both sides:

5B = 95

Divide by 5:

B = 19

Now that we know B, we can find A and S:

A = B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16

A = S + 2, so S = A - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14

Now that we know the ages of all family members, we can verify the sum of our ages:

A + B + S + M = 16 + 19 + 14 + (3*19 - 1) = 16 + 19 + 14 + 56 - 1 = 84

Since 84 is not equal to 87, there seems to be an inconsistency in the given information. However, we can still provide the answer based on the information given.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all the students. 

So, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the first day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water doubles again, so it becomes 2 * 8000 = 16000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

Final answer: 22000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. 

Initially, there are 10 infected people. 

Day 1: 10 infected people * 6 = 60 new infections, total infected = 10 + 60 = 70

Day 2: 70 infected people * 6 = 420 new infections, total infected = 70 + 420 = 490

Day 3: 490 infected people * 6 = 2940 new infections, total infected = 490 + 2940 = 3430

Therefore, after three days, there are 3430 people infected.

3430"
"To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we need to first calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:
40 * $20 = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total.
10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80
Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela, so her total tips are:
$800 - $80 = $720

Now, we can find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela:
$800 (Rafaela) + $720 (Julieta) = $1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she initially bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave away 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold.

Paige baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked a total of 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices sold by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is:

50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Since Mr. George ate 20 burritos, we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students:

500 burritos - 20 burritos = 480 burritos

The total number of leftover burritos is 480.

480"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of books Fawn has as 'x'. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, we can represent the number of books Anne has as 'x - 12'. 

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can represent the number of books Sofie has as '(x - 12) + 25' or 'x - 12 + 25' which simplifies to 'x + 13'.

We also know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will have. 

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we need to find out the total cost. We know the price per box is $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box.

Number of boxes needed: 12
Price per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the amount Keenan pays in a month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chicken for, we need to first determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell these 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make from selling them is:

180 * $50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we can subtract the desired profit from the total amount he wants to make:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

Now, we know that Isaias needs to sell the chickens for $7000. Since he plans to sell 180 chickens, we can calculate the cost of each chicken as follows:

$7000 / 180 = $38.89

So, Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for sale for approximately $38.89.

The final answer is: $38.89"

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the shop makes 125 chimichangas each day, so the total for these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, the shop makes twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so it makes 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on the three days: 250 (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) + 250 (Fridays) = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs.

Let's assume the total number of microphones is 50. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that won't fit is 20% of 50, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10.

The number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is the total number of microphones minus the number of microphones that won't fit, which is 50 - 10 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 40 / 2 = 20.

100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants. 

Two-thirds of 75 is 75 * (2/3) = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants. 

75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x meters per second.

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To find the speed of the thingamabob (x), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Whirligig speed = 5x
Whirligig speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig speed = 55 meters per second

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + (3 * 6) + (5 * 6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find John's profit, we need to calculate his total monthly income and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate his total monthly income:
Number of rentals per month: 10
Hours per rental: 3
Total hours per month: 10 * 3 = 30 hours
Hourly wage: $25
Total monthly income: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
Car payment: $500
Total monthly income: $750
Profit: $750 - $500 = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

3x = 7

where x is the number of notebooks Joseph had initially.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33

So Joseph initially had 2.33 notebooks. However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks.

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number of notebooks:

12 - 2 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis' distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
= 50 + (1/5 * 50)
= 50 + 10
= 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
= 50 + 60
= 110 miles

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel. Denise read 18 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

18 - 13 = 5

Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can assume that the pot can hold 8 bowls (the larger number). 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 5 people. Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, Calvin can have 8 / 5 = 1.6 bowls of soup. However, since you can't have a fraction of a bowl, Calvin can have 1 bowl of soup.

Now, we subtract Calvin's bowl from the total number of bowls. 8 - 1 = 7 bowls of soup left.

There are 2 children, and they can have 7 bowls of soup in total. To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup, we divide the total number of bowls left by the number of children. 

7 / 2 = 3.5

Since you can't have a fraction of a bowl, each child can have 3 bowls of soup for lunch."
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards = 10 yards

For large masks:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8/3 sets of 2.25 yards
To convert this into yards, we multiply 8/3 by 2.25:
(8/3) * 2.25 = 6 yards

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks:
10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

The total material needed is 16 yards."
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Total amount spent = $216
Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 visits per movie = 27 tickets

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so in a day, he sleeps for 10 hours * 2 (for two days) = 20 hours.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

"To find the number of blue shoeboxes left, we subtract the number of blue shoeboxes used from the total number of blue shoeboxes. 

Number of blue shoeboxes left = Total blue shoeboxes - Blue shoeboxes used
= 7 - 3
= 4

To find the number of red shoeboxes left, we first need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoeboxes. 

1/3 of red shoeboxes = (1/3) * 9
= 3

Now, we subtract the number of red shoeboxes used from the total number of red shoeboxes.

Number of red shoeboxes left = Total red shoeboxes - Red shoeboxes used

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the size of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres the two farms have together is 700."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Now, we know that Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. To find the number of yellow balloons, we can divide the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons (18) by 3. 

18 / 3 = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked each day:
5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours

The total hours worked by Bruce in the three days is 23."
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, the total cost of the balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.

The total cost of the items they bought is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($3) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they spent $28 in total, and they have 2 girls, we divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each girl received. $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total number of fruits initially, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

Total fruits = 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total number of fruits.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and then add them together.

Number of students playing tennis: 6
Number of students playing volleyball: 2 * 6 = 12
Number of students playing soccer: 16 + 22 = 38

Total number of students: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The profit per lollipop is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 * $0.3 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

1. Cats: 3
2. Dogs: 3 times the number of cats, so 3 * 3 = 9 dogs
3. Rabbits: 2 fewer than dogs, so 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits
4. Fish: 3 times the number of rabbits, so 3 * 7 = 21 fish
5. Gerbils: 1/3 the number of fish, so 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person eats per day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months she has been collecting shells is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first determine the total number of trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip (down and back up), he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Now, we know that the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he can make 2 trips in 8 hours, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

Berries per trip = Total berries / Number of trips
Berries per trip = 24 / 2
Berries per trip = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the tank initially.
Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water used from the tank in 6 days.
The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, in 6 days, the amount of water used will be 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days.
The initial amount of water in the tank was 5000 gallons. After 6 days, 3000 gallons were used. So, the remaining amount of water in the tank will be 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the tickets from the total money Colby has left. 

13 tickets * $10 = $130

$134 - $130 = $4

Colby has $4 left. Since tickets for other days cost $7, he can buy 4/7 of a ticket, but since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can't see any more movies.

The final answer is 13."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to first find the total number of Junebugs removed.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days:
300 / 5 = 60

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has.

Total number of toys initially = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48

Total number of toys now = 62

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys now - Total number of toys initially
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 3: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the value of P from equation 3 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is:
4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons
Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes:
8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the additional balloons are:
5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial balloons and the additional balloons:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

The total number of balloons the girls have is 24."
"To find the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables.

"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To calculate the daily earnings from each machine, we need to multiply the number of widgets produced per hour by the number of hours it runs per day and then multiply by the number of days in the month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60

"To determine the amount of money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the extended stay.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost of the 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so we subtract that from his total earnings:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so we subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:
250 dollars - (5 * 10 dollars) = 250 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

Now, John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank. We subtract this amount from his remaining money:
200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

To find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a pen:
100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount.

The original price of each CD is $15. James bought 10 CDs, so the total cost is:
10 * $15 = $150

Since James got 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount:
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60

The discounted price of the CDs is:
$150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, so he made:
5 * $40 = $200

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he made from the discounted price of the CDs:
$90 - $200 = -$110

James was out $110.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance = 12 miles

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends swimming 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x - 0 = 45.

Add 0 to both sides: 3x = 45.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15.

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and went to sleep at 10 p.m. However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. The time difference is 5 hours and 55 minutes. 

5 hours = 5 * 60 = 300 minutes
Adding the 55 minutes, we get 300 + 55 = 355 minutes.

However, we also need to account for the time she was sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m. The time difference is 23 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time she was asleep. 
355 - 23 = 332 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 332 minutes that day."
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially had, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to a numerical value. Two dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups. Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34.

"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds

So, the initial number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds will increase by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted will be:
50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be:
100 (initial occupied beds) + 700 (additional patients) = 800 beds

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 (total capacity) - 800 (occupied beds) = 200 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 200."

"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48:
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Since Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up an equation to find the number of balls Jeffrey carried:

Let x be the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls.
We know Jason carried 2 balls, so 2x = 2.
Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Now that we know Jeffrey carried 1 ball, we can find the number of balls Jordan carried:
Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jordan carried 2x = 2(1) = 2 balls.

Now that we know the number of balls each boy carried, we can find the total number of balls:
Total number of balls = Jeffrey's balls + Jason's balls + Jordan's balls
= 1 + 2 + 2
= 5

The coach brought 5 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as 'x'. 

We know that the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10. 
The total number of holes dug by the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.
The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 23 + 8 = 31. However, the pirates filled in 2 holes, so the actual number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 31 - 2 = 29.

We are also given that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. 
So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since the pirates dug 'x' holes on the fourth day, we can set up the equation: 
10 + 13 + 8 + x = 40

Combine the constants: 
31 + x = 40

Subtract 31 from both sides: 
x = 9

Therefore, the pirates dug 9 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add these amounts together: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

Therefore, there were 225 corn chips altogether.

225"
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

Cost of supplies = $400
50% of the cost of supplies = 0.5 * $400 = $200
Total cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
Total cost of travel = $400 + $200
Total cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

And we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for S into the first equation:
A + (4A - 13) + X = 339

Substituting X = S + 5 into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (S + 5) = 339

Since S = 4A - 13, we can substitute this into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339

Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we need to multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200 minutes

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is traveling in a southerly direction for the first 300 miles and then a northerly direction for 36 miles, we need to subtract the distance traveled in the second direction from the distance traveled in the first direction to find the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The bird then travels 110 miles in the southerly direction, so the total distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

Since the bird is traveling in a southerly direction for 374 miles, this is the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75 (which is 75% in decimal form).
So, Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then add them together.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given length = 15 feet and width = 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate half of 50 as 25. Then, we add 4 to get 29.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA (50) to the number of states in India (29) to get the total number of states in both countries.

50 + 29 = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 

$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25 (amount still needed)

Now, we can divide the amount still needed by Tyler's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work. 

$25 (amount still needed) ÷ $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share as follows:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Richard's cherries - Robert's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 20 - 30
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday. On Saturday, he sold 4 + 15 = 18 boxes of apple pie. So, on Sunday, he sold 18 - 4 = 14 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for the two days:

Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
Apple pie: 18 boxes * $15 = $270
Total earnings: $60 + $270 = $330

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) + 6 (Saturday) = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

First, convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space required for each plant and the space between them:
- Each plant is 12 inches wide
- There is 1.5 feet (18 inches) of space between each plant
- Total space required for each plant and the space between them = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the bed by the total space required for each plant and the space between them:
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be:
27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we can calculate how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$500 per month / $1,000 per pair = 0.5 pairs per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of pairs she can buy in a year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour. Since the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, the room warms up by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours. On high, it cools the room at 3 degrees per hour. So, the room cools by 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. Since the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour, it warms up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature. The room initially warmed up by 6 degrees, then cooled by 12 degrees, and finally warmed up by 4 degrees. The net change is 6 - 12 + 4 = -2 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 75 * 1 = 75 years.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, and Bill saw the comet for the second time 90 - 75 = 15 years after his dad saw it, we can calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as x = 90 - 15 = 75 years.

Therefore, Bill was 75 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. 

Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, it makes 3/4x flights to Greece. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the first plane makes (1/4x) / 2 = 1/8x flights to France.

We are also given that the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Since the total number of flights made by the first plane is x, we can set up the equation:

3/4x + 1/8x = x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 8 to eliminate the fractions:

6x + x = 8x

Combine like terms:

7x = 8x

Subtract 7x from both sides:

0 = x

This is a contradiction, as the number of flights cannot be zero. However, we can re-examine the equation and the given information.

Let's re-evaluate the information. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, the first plane must make 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, we can set up the equation:

3/4x + 1/8x = 88

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 8 to eliminate the fractions:

6x + x = 704

Combine like terms:

7x = 704

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 100.57 (round down to 100, as the number of flights must be a whole number)

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane is 100, we can find the number of flights to France:

1/8x = 1/8 * 100 = 12.5

Since the number of flights must be a whole number, we can round down to 12 flights to France.

"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings. 

$30 (total cost) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4 years respectively. 

2. Let's denote the age of Helene as H and the age of Wilfred as W. We know that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. 

   So, the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5 years.

3. Since Helene is twice the average age of the group, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10 years.

4. Now we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene, which are 3, 4, and 10 years respectively. We can find the age of Wilfred by subtracting the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the children.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute after Walter's friend gives him $200.

Let's assume Walter's friend's contribution is x. Then, the total amount collected will be $2000 + x + 3x (since the lawyer contributes three times as much as everyone else).

We know that Walter's friend gives him $200, so the total amount collected will be $2000 + $200 + 3x = $2200 + 3x.

Since Walter's lawyer contributes three times as much as everyone else, the total amount collected should be three times the amount Walter's friend contributes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$2200 + 3x = 3x

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as it implies that the total amount collected is equal to 3x, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct interpretation is that Walter's lawyer will contribute three times the amount Walter's friend contributes, but only after Walter's friend gives him $200. So, the correct equation is:

$2200 + 3x = 3(200)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$2200 + 3x = $600

Subtracting $2200 from both sides, we get:

3x = $400

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = $133.33

This is the amount Walter's friend will contribute. Since Walter's lawyer contributes three times as much as his friend, the lawyer's contribution will be 3x = 3 * $133.33 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1/2 * 1500 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

750 / 15 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

Since the total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Since the total number of slices is 6, and the adults get 4 slices, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:

(4/6) * 100% ≈ 66.67%

The final answer is 66.67."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours (total available) - 8 hours (total spent) = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To find the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold and multiply it by the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation:

8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 * 3 = $45.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $45. The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the total monthly cost, which is $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.

480"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

To find the total number of new porcupines in a year, we multiply the number of new porcupines per month by 12.

Total new porcupines in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the initial population of porcupines to the total number of new porcupines in a year to find the final population.

Final population = 50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

The final population of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism formed by the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = length * width * height.

Given the dimensions of the pool, we can plug in the values as follows:
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we multiply the volume by 5.9:
1400 * 5.9 = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
8260 * 0.10 = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

Number of red sticks = 9
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = 11

Total number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 220 miles

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles
Difference = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students over 16 years old by subtracting the number of male students over 16 years old from the total number of students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
10 - 5 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is (1 - 0.07)^3 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * x.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 - 0.09)^5 * x * (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(0.91)^5 * x * (0.93)^3 = 0.28

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 0.28 / ((0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3)

x ≈ 0.28 / 0.576
x ≈ 0.488

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 48.8%.

The final answer is 48.8."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He has purchased 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He has purchased 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He has purchased 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He has purchased 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. Since he can't spend a negative amount, this means he has spent more than he has. However, we can still calculate how many plums he can buy with the money he has left.

Since he has $0.25 left, he can buy 1 plum at $0.25.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each type of album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

Therefore, Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals as L and the number of small stuffed animals as S. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so S = 2L.

We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, and Teresa sold them for three times the price of large stuffed animals. Let's denote the price of a large stuffed animal as P. Then, the price of a small stuffed animal is 3P.

Since Teresa earned $120 from the sales, we can set up the equation:

4S + 3P * L = 120

Substituting S = 2L, we get:

4(2L) + 3P * L = 120
8L + 3PL = 120

Now, we need to find the price of a large stuffed animal (P). We know that the total earnings come from both large and small stuffed animals, but we don't know the price of a large stuffed animal yet. However, we can express the total earnings in terms of L and P:

4S + 3PL = 120
4(2L) + 3PL = 120
8L + 3PL = 120

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is 3P, and the price of a large stuffed animal is P. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the total earnings from small stuffed animals is 2S * 3P = 6PL. The total earnings from large stuffed animals is LP.

So, the total earnings can be expressed as:

6PL + LP = 120
7PL = 120

Now, we can solve for P:

P = 120 / 7
P = 17.14 (approximately)

Now that we know the price of a large stuffed animal (P), we can find the number of large stuffed animals (L):

LP = 120
L * 17.14 = 120
L = 120 / 17.14
L = 7

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals (L), we can find the number of small stuffed animals (S):

S = 2L
S = 2 * 7
S = 14

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. 

40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply the daily amount by 30.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: In this case, Marcus will have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 50% (no substitute teacher) * 60% (normal teacher doesn't give an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30%.

2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 50% (no substitute teacher) * 40% (normal teacher gives an extension) = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2 or 20%.

3. The whole class gets an extension: In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 50% (no substitute teacher) * 20% (whole class gets an extension) = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 or 10%.

4. The whole class gets an extension and Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment: In this case, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 50% (no substitute teacher) * 20% (whole class gets an extension) * 20% (Marcus convinces the teacher) = 0.5 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.02 or 2%.

Since there are 4750 remaining seats, and there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

Final answer: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as follows:

Number of medium-sized beans = 2 * Number of large beans
= 2 * 75
= 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

Number of small beans = Number of medium-sized beans / 3
= 150 / 3
= 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her expenses.

Total daily income: $15 per day
Total daily expenses: $3 per day (parking)

Total daily income after expenses: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours

Total jury pay: $12 per day * 18 hours = $216

Jury pay per hour: $216 / 18 hours = $12 per hour

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes he ordered.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = 80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school:
Total amount of money lost = Number of years in school * Annual income before college
Total amount of money lost = 4 years * $25,000/year
Total amount of money lost = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating:
Total amount of money earned = Number of years in school * Annual income after college
Total amount of money earned = 4 years * $75,000/year (since his income tripled)
Total amount of money earned = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to repay the loans:
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = Total amount of money lost + Total amount of money earned
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = $100,000 + $300,000
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = $400,000

Since Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year, the number of years it would take to repay the loans is:
Number of years to repay loans = Total amount of money needed to repay loans / Annual loan amount
Number of years to repay loans = $400,000 / $50,000/year
Number of years to repay loans = 8 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length * Width
Area = 8 feet * 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Population of each city = 1000

Total population of South America = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights after the growth.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 0.25 feet) = 4.25 feet
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches = 4.33 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 52 inches = 4.33 feet)

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height = 4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet

To convert the difference to inches, we multiply by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
0.08 feet * 12 inches/foot = 0.96 inches

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 0.96 inches."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: $576.67"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, we need to find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to decimal and multiply it by the number of days in 3 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.

3/8 = 0.375 (converting the fraction to decimal)

Now, multiply the decimal by the number of days:
0.375 x 21 = 7.875

Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by 4:
7.875 ÷ 4 = 1.96875

So, each painter worked approximately 1.97 hours.

The final answer is 1.97."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,865.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to find the total number of non-Spanish books. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 
50 - 25 - 5 = 20

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of people on the train at each stop.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. 
Total people = 120 + 20 = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and twice that number (100) boarded the train.
Total people = 140 - 50 + 100 = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train.
Total people = 190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The package of athletic socks costs $8, and Alison has a coupon for $2 off, so the final cost is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

The area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, and each tile is 1ft x 1ft, so the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor with 1ft x 1ft tiles.

"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, and Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up an equation:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can calculate Silvia's slices as follows:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cost of the cast, the cost of the painkillers, and the cost of parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit:
The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, we can calculate the cost as follows:
$300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cast:
The doctor charges $200 for the cast.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers:
The doctor charges $4/pill for 30 painkillers. Since we don't know the exact number of pills, we'll assume it's 30 pills (as mentioned in the problem). 
$4/pill * 30 pills = $120

Finally, let's calculate the cost of parking:
The doctor charges $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking.
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Now, let's add up the costs:
$150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find the number of emails James responds to, we need to first find the number of emails that require a response. 

20% of 80 emails don't require a response, so we need to find 20% of 80.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches remaining is 7 - 4 = 3.

3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches remaining is 3 (from step 2) + 3 (newly ordered) = 6.

4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To find the total cost, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter as follows:

- 6 pounds of butter / 2 pounds per promotion = 3 sets of the promotion
- 3 sets of the promotion * 1.5 (cost of 1.5 pounds of butter) = 4.5 pounds of butter
- 4.5 pounds of butter * $4.00 per pound = $18.00

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they initially had.

Let's denote Maggie's initial amount of money as M and Riza's initial amount of money as R.

Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4 of her money left, which is (3/4)M. Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has 2/3 of her money left, which is (2/3)R.

We are given that both Maggie and Riza have $60 left. So, we can set up the following equations:

(3/4)M = 60
(2/3)R = 60

To solve for M and R, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

M = 60 * (4/3) = 80
R = 60 * (3/2) = 90

Now that we know Maggie and Riza initially had $80 and $90, respectively, we can find out how much money they have left:

Maggie's remaining money: 80 - 60 = 20
Riza's remaining money: 90 - 60 = 30

The total amount of money they have left is 20 + 30 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys per day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas.

315 - 24 = 291 bananas left for the third monkey.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the remaining bananas by 7 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day.

291 / 7 = 41.57 bananas per day.

The third monkey eats approximately 41.57 bananas per day."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces in the first half.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces within an hour.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

Final answer: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny spent on roses, we first need to determine the cost of the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, and a dozen roses costs $15, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:

15 roses / 12 roses per dozen = 1.25 dozen roses
1.25 dozen roses * $15 per dozen = $18.75

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is equivalent to $25. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the cost of the roses from the $25:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

$6.25 * 4 = 25 quarters

Jenny will leave with 25 quarters.

Final answer: 25"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total revenue from each item and then add them together.

1. Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
2. Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
3. Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total revenue from each item: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

Terry makes $162 in total."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each train spends at the station and the time between each train's arrival.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after the initial time. 

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the initial time. It stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after the initial time.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the initial time. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes after the initial time.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the initial time. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the total time Paul will wait for his train. Paul will wait until the fourth train arrives, which is 145 minutes after the initial time. However, we need to subtract the time Paul is already waiting for the first train, which is 10 minutes. So, the total time Paul will wait is 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far from the total number of toothpicks required.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks at the same rate. To do this, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10).

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks she needs for her sculpture.

80"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so the sale price is 0.75 * original price = 2000. 

To find the original price, we divide 2000 by 0.75. 

Original price = 2000 / 0.75 = 2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 

The sale price to his friend = 1.2 * 2000 = 2400

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price to his friend, and then divide it by the original price.

Discount = (Original price - Sale price) / Original price
= (2666.67 - 2400) / 2666.67
= 266.67 / 2666.67
= 0.1 or 10%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price. 

Final answer: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to determine the rate at which the springs create jellyfish. Since every second, a spring creates a new jellyfish, the rate is 1 jellyfish per second.

Next, we need to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. Therefore, there are 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds in 4 hours.

Now, we can multiply the rate of jellyfish creation (1 per second) by the total number of seconds in 4 hours (14400) to find the total number of jellyfish created:

1 jellyfish/second * 14400 seconds = 14400 jellyfish

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Final answer: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Now, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), we can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since James walked to the store and back, the total time it took him to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, let's find out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually. The amount saved would be the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply the price of each type by the number sold.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= 67500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= 11250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB bike
= 105 * 500
= 52500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= 67500 + 11250 + 52500
= 131250

The final answer is: 131250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

Number of classes per week: 5 days * 2 classes/day = 10 classes
Total minutes per class: 40 minutes
Total minutes per week: 10 classes * 40 minutes/class = 400 minutes

Since John also spends extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends on these days.

Extra learning time per day: 1/16 * 60 minutes = 3.75 minutes
Total extra learning time per week: 3.75 minutes/day * 2 days = 7.5 minutes

Now, we can find the total minutes John spends learning per week:
Total minutes per week = Total minutes in class + Total extra learning time per week
Total minutes per week = 400 minutes + 7.5 minutes
Total minutes per week = 407.5 minutes

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Total hours per week = 407.5 minutes / 60
Total hours per week = 6.79 hours

The final answer is: 6.79"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12, which equals 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to determine the number of bags sold.

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards from the last step.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the amount left after the T-Rex ate was 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the initial amount was 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

"To find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 unshaken sodas. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 9 - 1 = 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 3 shaken sodas and 8 - 2 = 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, when Ellen's friend arrives, there are 3 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left. The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 3/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(3/9) * 100 = 33.33%

The final answer is 33.33."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

Total distance = 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the total number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, the number of days Billy is available to help is 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days Billy is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this total time per day, we need to multiply it by the number of days.

1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

1. The item that was returned is $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

2. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

3. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we add the cost of the items after the discounts to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - (x/5) = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her annual savings and then divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings.

First, let's calculate her annual savings:
Annual salary: $100,000
Savings rate: 20%
Annual savings: $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement:
Retirement period: 20 years
Annual savings: $20,000
Total amount needed: $20,000 * 20 = $400,000

Now, let's calculate how many years she needs to work to save the required amount:
Total amount needed: $400,000
Annual savings: $20,000
Number of years: $400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years

However, Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is:
Annual salary: $100,000
Living expenses: $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000
Remaining amount for savings: $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000

Since she needs to save $400,000 and can only save $60,000 per year, she needs to work for:
Total amount needed: $400,000
Annual savings: $60,000
Number of years: $400,000 / $60,000 = 6.67 years

Since Lauren can't work a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 7 years to save the required amount.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This gives us the length of each of the initial cuts: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm.

2. Then, we take the length of each initial cut (25 cm) and divide it by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5). This gives us the length of each final cut: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the given percentage of boys to set up an equation. 

Let's denote the total population as 'x'. Since 40% of the population is made up of boys, we can write the equation as:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total population:
Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of heels, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of balls and then add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we assume it's a typo and the question is actually asking about Pierre and Paul. 

So, Pierre and Paul together have 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

The remaining amount of apples will be 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the initial amount he had.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find the cost of each book, we need to first determine the total amount Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so the total amount spent on the books is $12 - $2 = $10.

Since Anna bought 2 books that cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 / 2 = $5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the original number of students and add it to the original number.

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

The total number of students this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so the rate is 255 / 5 = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can divide the total number of blinks (459) by the rate (51 blinks per minute) to find the total time:

459 / 51 = 9 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

After buying:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the difference between the number of female and male fish:
Female fish: 8
Male fish: 6

The difference between the number of female and male fish is: 8 - 6 = 2

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance driven by John in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by the number of times he visits his parents in a month.

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles one way. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, she will walk a total of 10 * 7 = 70 miles in 7 days.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can set up the equation:

70 = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 / 2
Brian's distance = 35

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

35"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since there are 5 workers in total, and 4 workers have already produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs. 
Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds altogether.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
The total weight of both dogs is 45 + 60 = 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris received 7 stickers from Luis and kept 9 stickers. So, the total number of stickers Kris received from Luis is 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

Since Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, the total number of stickers Luis had initially must be twice the number of stickers Kris received. Therefore, Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so the total number of stickers Seth had initially must be twice the number of stickers Luis had. Therefore, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the total number of small bags.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly to reach half of the way around the earth, we need to divide the circumference of the earth by 2.

Circumference of the earth = 40,000 kilometers
Half of the circumference = 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day.

Number of days = Total distance / Distance flown per day
= 20,000 / 400
= 50

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Since Vince's age 2 years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted:
Difference = C - A
Difference = 21 - 9
Difference = 12

"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to first find out how many boxes Nik will need. 

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons is:
Total weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of the crayons to pounds:
Total weight of crayons (in pounds) = Total weight of crayons / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the boxes is:
Total weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Converting the weight of the boxes to pounds:
Total weight of boxes (in pounds) = Total weight of boxes / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
Total weight = Total weight of crayons + Total weight of boxes
= 12.5 + 12.5
= 25 pounds

1. John cuts down an 80-foot tree. 
2. He can make logs out of 80% of it, which is 80 * 0.8 = 64 feet of logs.
3. He cuts the logs into 4-foot logs. So, the number of logs he gets is 64 / 4 = 16 logs.
4. From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks is 16 * 5 = 80 planks.
5. He sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total amount he makes is 80 * $1.2 = $96.

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother's salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks 3 miles in total, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile. 

We know that the time spent on the sidewalk is twice the time spent on the beach. Let's denote the time spent on the beach as x. Then, the time spent on the sidewalk is 2x.

We are given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, so x = 40. 

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk: 2x = 2 * 40 = 80 minutes.

The total time spent on the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 + 80 = 120 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate the total amount she has saved so far.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 * 8 = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount of $28. Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles.

2. So, if Bob receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 
   Initial marbles = 60 - 24 = 36

3. Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36.
   Final marbles = 36 - 10 = 26

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the information given:

- Donny has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature.
- He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle.
- The water in the bottle is now drinkable, meaning it's at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the amount of water in the bottle becomes 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water. 

The total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. Since the water is now drinkable, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(4 * 33) + (1 * x) ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x ≥ 40

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 8

So, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 8 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost of 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many scoops 3 less than 6 potatoes make. Since 6 - 3 = 3, 3 less than 6 potatoes make 3 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes 3 scoops make. Since 3 scoops are made from 3 less than 6 potatoes, we can say that 3 scoops are made from 3 potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 23 - 5 = 18, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes 18 scoops make. Since 3 scoops are made from 3 potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes 18 scoops make. 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, Gomer ate 6 potatoes.

100 rocks * $5/rock = $500

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks he sells is:
60% of 100 rocks = 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks

The revenue from selling 60 rocks at $7 each is:
60 rocks * $7/rock = $420

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities:

0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected.

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells.

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = total number of seashells

Combine like terms:

5x + 5 = total number of seashells

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3:

(5x + 5) / 3 = number of seashells each person gets

Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can write:

2x + 5 = 27

Subtract 5 from both sides:

2x = 22

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of seashells each person collected:

Carrey collected x = 11 seashells
Carlos collected 2x = 2 * 11 = 22 seashells
Jim collected 2x + 5 = 22 + 5 = 27 seashells

Now, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person gets:

(5x + 5) / 3 = (5 * 11 + 5) / 3 = (55 + 5) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20

So, each person gets 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of the second song = Length of the first song + (60% of the length of the first song)
= 5 minutes + (0.6 * 5 minutes)
= 5 minutes + 3 minutes
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 minutes + 8 minutes
= 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday = 2 * $20 = $40
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday = 4 * $20 = $80
Total cost = $40 + $80 = $120

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices = 6 * $40 = $240

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost.
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $240 - $120
= $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Carl's height first. 

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, this is a negative number, which means Hortex already produces more than the required amount. Therefore, they don't need to produce any more bottles to meet the demand.

Final answer: 0"
"To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since Carla gave birth to octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple-wearing babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows, so the number of purple-wearing babies with bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the purple-wearing babies with bows and the blue-wearing babies with bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, the number of blue-wearing babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2. 

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple) + 2 (blue) = 4.

Now, we can find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of purple-wearing babies with bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on all days = 5168

Total reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on all days - (Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Total reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.

He then sold 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.

Finally, he sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 30 square meters for 30 * 3 = $90.

Now, let's add up the money he received from each sale: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

The final answer is: $170"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13

"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person finds and then subtract that from the total number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = 3120 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so it produces 10 * 50 - 200 = 300 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1650

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation: B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation: R = 4B.

Now, we are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation: Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Ronnie was given $x. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, she was given 3x.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave away 1/5 of her money.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x - (1/5)(3x) = (4/5)(3x)

Simplifying the equation:

3x - 3x/5 = 12x/5

Combine like terms:

(15x - 3x)/5 = 12x/5

12x/5 = 12x/5

This equation is true for all values of x, but we know that Ronnie was given $5. So, we can substitute x = 5 into the original equation to find the amount Ronnie gave to her sister:

3(5) - (1/5)(3(5)) = (4/5)(3(5))

15 - 3 = 12

12 = 12

This equation is true, so we can conclude that Ronnie gave her sister $3.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. We know that Ronnie was given $5 and gave her sister $3. So, Ronnie has:

$5 - $3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each color as x. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, we can set up the equation:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + x (yellow) = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Since x represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find the number of cycles, we first need to determine the cost of the new box. Since the price remains the same, and the new box has 20% more pods, we can calculate the cost per pod in the new box.

The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. So, the cost per pod is $12 / 100 = $0.12 per pod.

The new box has 20% more pods, which means it has 100 + (20% of 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

The cost per pod in the new box is $0.12 / 120 = $0.001 per pod.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. We can do this by dividing $1 by the cost per pod in the new box: $1 / $0.001 = 1000 cycles.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

Let's assume the total length of the chalk is 5 inches. 
45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he must have used up 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 
20% of 2.25 inches = 0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45 inches

Since the teacher has already used 2.25 inches, we need to subtract this from the total length of the chalk to find the remaining length.
5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of days:
0.45 = 0.20 * x

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.20:
x = 0.45 / 0.20
x = 2.25

Since 'x' represents the number of days, we need to round up to the nearest whole number because the teacher can't use a fraction of a day. However, in this case, we can see that 2.25 is the exact amount of chalk left, so the teacher will have 1 more day to use the chalk before it's too small.

The teacher will have 1 more day before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of pizzas needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since both types of pizzas require 3 pizzas, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. Therefore, she needs to buy a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 snowballs will melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 2 = 18.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 18 snowballs per hour. 

Time = Total snowballs / Net snowballs per hour

"To find Jim's age, we need to determine how old John was when Digimon was released. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim at that time, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can write the equation as:

2x = 28 - x

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 28 - x
2x + x = 28
3x = 28
x = 28 / 3
x = 9.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of x to find Jim's age now.

Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release was 9.33 years. To find Jim's current age, we add the number of years that have passed since Digimon's release. However, we don't know the exact release year of Digimon. 

Assuming Digimon was released in 1999 (as it was released in 1999 in Japan), we can calculate Jim's current age:

Jim's current age = 9.33 + (2023 - 1999)
= 9.33 + 24
= 33.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of Jim's age.

Jim's current age is approximately 33.33 years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. 

The total cost of the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week. 
Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus
= $270 + $40
= $310

"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we need to first find out how much blood a single shark has. 

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood of a shark as follows:

Blood of a shark = 3 * Blood of a whale
Blood of a shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Blood of a shark = 120 gallons

Now, we need to find the total blood of ten sharks:

Total blood of ten sharks = Blood of a shark * 10
Total blood of ten sharks = 120 gallons * 10
Total blood of ten sharks = 1200 gallons

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Number of red pens = 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens
Number of black pens = 2 * number of red pens = 2 * 25 = 50 pens

Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens = 25 + 50 = 75 pens

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since the cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted in the two days:
- White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140.

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's represent the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. 

The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. 

The equation is then: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find the total number of fish with red stripes. 

One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we multiply 66 by 1/3:
66 * 1/3 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract 22 from the total number of fish:
66 - 22 = 44

Now, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We multiply 44 by 5/11:
44 * 5/11 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

The total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had and then subtract the colors she used or lost.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors, so Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, the question asks for the height from the second floor's floor, which means we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor. So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. 

Let's re-evaluate the question. The question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. This means we need to find the height of the roof above the second floor. 

The height of the first floor is 180 inches, and the height of the second floor is 240 inches. The height of the roof above the second floor is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this is still not correct.

Let's re-evaluate the question again. The height of the roof above the second floor is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor. The height of the roof above the second floor is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this is still not correct.

The correct interpretation is that the height of the roof above the second floor is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor. The height of the roof above the second floor is 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

"To find the total amount of exercise the dogs need per day, we can multiply the number of dogs by the average miles they need to walk per day. 

There are 4 dogs, and they need to walk 3 miles per day on average. 
Total miles per day = 4 dogs * 3 miles = 12 miles

Now, let's subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs:
Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

To find the miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles per day:
Miles the last dog needs to walk = Total miles per day - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles the last dog needs to walk = 12 - 8
Miles the last dog needs to walk = 4

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and then add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters.

"To find the total amount Stephen needs to pay, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

The total amount Stephen needs to pay is the initial $300 plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

To find the amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to find the volume of the jar. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total jelly beans = Volume / 0.8
Total jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Total jelly beans = 675

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to find the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 675 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 202.5

However, the problem states that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans, we subtract the estimated number from the true number.

Difference = True number - Estimated number
Difference = 900 - 202.5

3. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. 
   Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30 people.
   So, the total number of people on the bus now is 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. 
   So, the total number of people on the bus now is 90 * 2 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. 
   To find the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required for each group.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 1 group per grade. Now, we need to find the total number of grades:

There are 4 grades (4-7), and 1 group per grade, so there are 4 groups in total.

Now, we need to find the total time required for all groups to try the escape room. Each group uses 45 minutes, and there are 4 groups:

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

0 = x

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation as follows:

Original amount - x = 1/4 * Original amount

We can rewrite this as:

x - x = 1/4 * x

This equation doesn't make sense, so let's try a different approach.

Let's say Eve gave away 'y' pomelos. Then, the equation becomes:

20 - y = 1/4 * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - y = 5

Now, we can solve for 'y':

y = 20 - 5
y = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of apples Walter ate: 
   2/5 of 60 apples = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples

2. Calculate the remaining number of apples after Walter ate 24 apples:
   60 - 24 = 36 apples

3. Calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister:
   25% of 36 apples = (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples

4. Calculate the remaining number of apples after Walter gave 9 apples to his sister:
   36 - 9 = 27 apples

5. Calculate the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples:
   27 apples * $3/apple = $81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to multiply the number of novels she wrote last year by 4, since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote this year is equal to the number of novels she wrote last year.

Number of novels written last year = 9
Number of quarters = 3
Total number of novels written this year = 9 * 4 = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, we can calculate the total hours traveled as follows:

3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes is 84 + 6 (the grapes eaten by Madeline) = 90 grapes.

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.
The total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week is $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Now, we need to find the total number of hours the custodian works in 5 days:
Total hours worked = 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total time spent cleaning classrooms by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%

The custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms on average."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of books each shelf can hold. 

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelf can hold as 'x'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as the middle shelf, it can hold 2x books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

We know that the total number of books is 110. Since there are 3 shelves, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 110

Combine like terms:

5x - 5 = 110

Add 5 to both sides:

5x = 115

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 23

Now that we know the middle shelf can hold 23 books, we can find the number of books the bottom shelf can hold (2x = 2 * 23 = 46) and the top shelf can hold (2x - 5 = 2 * 23 - 5 = 41).

To find the total number of bookcases needed, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold. Since each bookcase has 3 shelves, we can divide the total number of books by 3:

110 / 3 = 36.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 37 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs
Cost per dozen = $2.40
Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozen
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Number of eggs in 5 dozens = 60 eggs
Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per set = 20 sets
Total revenue = 20 sets * $1 per set = $20

Now, let's find the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats: 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 red hats.

2. Then, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find the remaining hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

3. Next, we find the number of blue hats: 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 off. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the total cost by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 110) + 40
Total questions = (0.7 * 110) + 40
Total questions = 77 + 40
Total questions = 117

Now, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test:

Questions correct on the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct on the first test = (0.6 * 70)
Questions correct on the first test = 42

Since Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can set up an equation:

(42 + x) / 117 = 0.7

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 117:

42 + x = 0.7 * 117
42 + x = 81.9

Now, we can subtract 42 from both sides:

x = 81.9 - 42
x = 39.9

Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 39.9 is closer to 40 than 40 is to 39.9, so we can round down to 40.

Audrey needs to get 40 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent it as 5s - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes should be equal to 116. 

We can write the equation as: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6: s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the equation 5s - 4: 
5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played per year by the number of years and then multiply that by her score per game.

Number of games per year = 40
Number of years = 4
Score per game = 21

Total points = Number of games per year * Number of years * Score per game
Total points = 40 * 4 * 21
Total points = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He then found a bead, which is not a marble, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has, as a bead is not a marble.

Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to find out how many calls it takes to get 1 customer, we divide 25 by 1. This gives us 25 calls per customer.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars, we divide 15 by 1. This gives us 15 customers.

Now, we know that it takes 25 calls to get 1 customer, and we need 15 customers to sell 15 cars. To find out how many calls Jason needs to make, we multiply the number of customers needed by the number of calls per customer. This gives us 15 * 25 = 375 calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 375 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them up.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Number of rooms with small candles = 8 / 2 = 4
Number of rooms with medium candles = 8 / 2 = 4

Total number of small candles = 4 * 4 = 16
Total number of medium candles = 4 * 5 = 20

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36

There is one flashlight for each person, and there are 4 people in the house. So, the total number of flashlights = 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 (candles) + 4 (flashlights) = 40

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 20 * 2
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 footballs, we can find the number of robots, which is half as many as helmets:
Robots = (1/2) * 20
Robots = 10

Now we have the number of robots (10), helmets (20), and footballs (40). To find the total number of items, we add them together:
Total items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total items = 70

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day at work, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which equals 360 minutes per day.

Now, we can divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes per day / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day

Since Tim works for 5 days in a week, we can multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water:
4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

Next, let's calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water:
8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, let's calculate the amount of water for the remaining plants. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining number of plants is 20 - 12 = 8.

Since the remaining 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we can calculate the total amount of water for these plants:
8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the total amount of water needed for all the plants:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water.

Since Phineas needs to cover half the distance on land and half the distance in water, the total distance he needs to cover is 200 yards. 

Half of 200 yards is 100 yards. 

Time taken to hop on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

Time taken to swim in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

Total time taken = Time taken to hop on land + Time taken to swim in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days (5) and add it to the total number of people for the first three days.

Total number of people for the rest of the week = 60 * 5 = 300
Total number of people for the first three days = 50 + 70 + 140 = 260

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 60 seconds is 20 + 60 = 80.

3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   So, in the next 30 seconds, 80 * 30 = 240 kernels pop.

4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds. 
   The previous rate was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   So, in the final 30 seconds, 40 * 30 = 120 kernels pop.

5. The total number of kernels popped in the first 120 seconds is 80 + 240 + 120 = 440.

6. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   In the final 30 seconds, 120 kernels popped, so a quarter of that is 120 / 4 = 30 kernels.

7. The total number of kernels popped is 440 (from the first 120 seconds) + 30 (from the residual heat) = 470 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, 5 gallons will require 5 cups of lemon juice. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 5 cups of juice by multiplying 5 cups by 6 lemons per cup. 

5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice as the other gallons. 

So, for the extra gallon, we need 1/2 cup of lemon juice. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1/2 cup of juice by multiplying 1/2 cup by 6 lemons per cup. 

(1/2) * 6 lemons/cup = 3 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon. 

30 lemons + 3 lemons = 33 lemons

"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Total number of legs = 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since each leg belongs to one animal, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs.
Total number of pairs of legs = 80 / 2 = 40.

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled and then determine the direction he is from his house.

Since Elvis traveled west for 5 hours and then turned around and traveled east for 8 hours, we can calculate the total distance he traveled as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
For the westward journey: Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles
For the eastward journey: Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we can calculate the net distance from his house as follows:

Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles east of his house.

The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know that the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies.

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - (Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189
= 43

The final answer is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 back to find the initial amount: 
21 + 4 = 25

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and we now know Dallas initially had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received:
52 - 25 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets:

The family pays a total of $38."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total length of crepe paper needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find their ages. 

Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart, Emma's age can be calculated by adding 16 to Mia's age. 

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs in total, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs the guests will eat and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is:
15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes

Since she practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, the total time spent on yoga per week is:
60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week:
30 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 330 minutes per week

Since there are 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is:
330 minutes per week * 4 weeks = 1320 minutes

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, we can convert the dozen to a numerical value: 1 dozen = 12, so 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower. 

50% of 36 seeds is 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds. 

Now, we add 18 seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds in the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 (small sunflower) + 54 (large sunflower) = 90 seeds.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert's height is 36"". Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate Anne's height by multiplying Albert's height by 2. 
Anne's height = 2 * 36"" = 72""

We also know that Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne. So, we can calculate Jackie's height by subtracting 2"" from Anne's height.
Jackie's height = 72"" - 2"" = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we can calculate her height before the summer by subtracting 3"" from her current height.
Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3"" = 67""

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes created by the dog during Nate's vacation and then determine how many holes Nate fills per week.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes created is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes per day. 
The net change is 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes net filled per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill the 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes net filled per day.
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks by dividing by 7:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.

We are also told that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. Since we know that Igor gathered 24 items, the number of beakers he gathered is 29 - 24 = 5.

However, Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so Igor must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed would be 'x/2' miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we need to find out how long it took her to run that distance. 

Since speed = distance / time, we can rearrange the formula to find time: time = distance / speed.

For Vanessa, the time taken would be 4 / (x/2) = 8/x minutes.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is 'x' miles per minute, we can find his distance by multiplying his speed by the time: distance = x * 16 = 16x miles.

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, her distance would be 2 * 16x = 32x miles.

Now, we can find Vanessa's time using the formula: time = distance / speed. So, Vanessa's time = 32x / (x/2) = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can calculate the cost price of each watermelon as follows:

Let's assume the cost price of each watermelon is x.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is 50x.

The selling price of each watermelon is 125% of the cost price (100% + 25% profit).

The selling price of each watermelon is 1.25x.

We know that the total selling price of 50 watermelons is $80.

So, we can set up the equation: 
50 * 1.25x = 80

Solving for x, we get:
50 * 1.25x = 80
62.5x = 80
x = 80 / 62.5
x = 1.28

Now that we know the cost price of each watermelon, we can find the selling price:
Selling price = 1.25x
= 1.25 * 1.28
= 1.6

So, the selling price of each watermelon is $1.6.

The final answer is: $1.6"

1. First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. So, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

2. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

3. We know that James is 18 years old now, and he is 9 years older than John's youngest son. So, John's youngest son is 18 - 9 = 9 years old now.

4. To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 9 + 3 = 12 years.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference in the number of oranges they peel.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. 

In 1 hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60/3 = 20 oranges, and Jane will peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the installation. Mark hires a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The cost of the installation is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the installation to get the total cost. 

$320 (radiator) + $150 (installation) = $470.

The final answer is: $470."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation: c + b = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write another equation: 2c + 4b = 70.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2c + 4b = 70
2(c + b) = 2(20)
2c + 2b = 40

Subtracting the two equations:
(2c + 4b) - (2c + 2b) = 70 - 40
2b = 30

Dividing both sides by 2:
b = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'b' into the first equation:
c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and 3 of his friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
