"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first find out how many eggs she has left after eating and baking.

She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

She lays 16 eggs per day, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 x 2 = $18 per day.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to add the blue and white fibers. 

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, let's add them together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after Josh put in the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 x $80,000 = $120,000. 

So, the new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs. 

The profit is the new value minus the cost of repairs: $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

He runs 3 sprints a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. 

3 sprints * 60 meters = 180 meters

So, James runs 180 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to first find out how many cups of feed she has already given to her chickens.

In the morning, she gave 15 cups of feed to 20 chickens. 
In the afternoon, she gave 25 cups of feed to 20 chickens.

So, the total cups of feed she has already given is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since she gives 3 cups of feed to each chicken, we need to divide 40 cups by 3 to find out how many cups of feed each chicken got. 
40 / 3 = 13.33 cups per chicken.

Now, we need to find out how many cups of feed she needs for the final meal. Since there are 20 chickens, we multiply 20 by 3 to find out the total cups of feed needed for the final meal. 
20 * 3 = 60 cups.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass.

The first glass costs $5.

The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 x $5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

The cost of the remaining 14 glasses is 14 x $3 = $42.

Now, we add the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 14 glasses.

$5 + $42 = $47.

Kylar needs to pay $47 for 16 glasses.

"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts.

First, Carla downloads 60% of the file (200 GB * 0.6 = 120 GB) at a speed of 2 GB/minute. So, it takes her 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes to download 60% of the file.

Then, the download is interrupted and the computer restarts. After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file (200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB) at the same speed of 2 GB/minute. So, it takes her 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes to download the remaining 40% of the file.

Now, we add the time it took to download the first 60% of the file and the time it took to download the remaining 40% of the file. 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 100 minutes.

"To find the distance John is from home, we need to break down his journey into parts.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he turns around and drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic. Since he's not moving, the distance remains the same, 180 miles.

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

Finally, he drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

Now, we add up all the distances: 180 + 180 + 15 + 160 = 535 miles.

So, John is 535 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.

For the first 40 hours, Eliza earns $10 per hour. 
40 hours * $10 per hour = $400

For the overtime hours, Eliza earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.
Since she worked 5 overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5), 
5 hours * $12 per hour = $60

Now, let's add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours.
$400 + $60 = $460

The answer is: $460"
"To find the total downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the downloads were three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 x 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts cost 3 x $68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes cost 2 x $80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes cost 6 x $55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the profit each year.

The cost to plant the tree is $90.
Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons and sells them for $1.5 each, so the income is 7 x $1.5 = $10.5.
Each year, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree.

The profit each year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take to start earning money, we need to divide the cost of the tree by the profit each year.

$90 รท $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she has 2/3 of her vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So now, she has 2/3 - 2 = 4/3 vacuum cleaners left.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left. Half of 4/3 is 2/3. So, she sold 2/3 of 4/3, which is 8/9 vacuum cleaners.

Now, she has 4/3 - 8/9 vacuum cleaners left. To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 9. So, we convert 4/3 to 12/9. 

12/9 - 8/9 = 4/9 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up an equation: 4/9 = 5.

To solve for the total number of vacuum cleaners, we can multiply both sides by 9. This gives us 4 = 45.

So, Melanie started with 45 vacuum cleaners."
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance. 
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students.
20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students are enrolled in jazz dance.
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.
16 - 4 = 12 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12. To find the percentage, we divide 12 by the total number of students and multiply by 100.
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the future value of both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial price: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Future value = Initial price + (Initial price * Market increase)
= $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
= $5,000 + $125
= $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial price: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Future value = Initial price + (Initial price * Market increase)
= $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
= $8,000 + $96
= $8,096

Since the future value of the jewelry ($5,125) is less than the future value of the electronic gadgets ($8,096), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Future value of electronic gadgets - Initial price of electronic gadgets
= $8,096 - $8,000
= $96"
"To find the distance covered by each train, we need to add the distance they traveled westward and the distance they traveled northward.

Since they traveled for 80 miles westward, and then 150 miles northward, we can add these two distances together.

Distance covered by each train in the two days = 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The answer is 230."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her income from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher. She works 35 hours a week as a teacher. 
35 hours * $20 per hour = $700 per week

Jill earns $30 per hour as a coach. She works 15 hours a week as a coach. 
15 hours * $30 per hour = $450 per week

Now, let's add her income from teaching and coaching together. 
$700 per week + $450 per week = $1150 per week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply her weekly income by 50. 
$1150 per week * 50 weeks = $57,500 per year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to first find out how many eggs she eats in one week. 

She makes 3 eggs every morning, so in one week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days = 21 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 
21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide 84 eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent on the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

She spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and 1 hour on the next 2 miles. 
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we need to find the total time she should spend to cover 12 miles at that speed. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since she has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 more hour to reach her goal.

Now, we need to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance in 1 hour. 

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so we multiply 10 liters by 2/3 to find the amount of water in the orange drink: 
10 * 2/3 = 20/3 liters

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so we multiply 15 liters by 3/5 to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
15 * 3/5 = 9 liters

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 
20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters

We spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water:
29/3 - 1 = 28/3 liters

Now we have 24 liters of the mixture. To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to convert 28/3 to a decimal and then multiply it by 24/24 (which is 1). 
28/3 = 9.33, and 9.33 * 1 = 9.33 liters

The final answer is 9.33."
"To find the answer, we need to know how old Raymond is. 

Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we need to subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age. 

Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know Raymond's age and his son's age. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we need to subtract Raymond's age from his son's age.

Years ago his son was born = Raymond's son's age - Raymond's age
Years ago his son was born = 23 - 25
Years ago his son was born = -2

Since we can't have a negative number of years, we need to think about this problem differently. We know Raymond's son was born at 23 and Raymond is 25 now. So, we need to find the difference between 23 and 25.

Years ago his son was born = 25 - 23
Years ago his son was born = 2

The answer is 2."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to add up the number of DVDs each customer bought.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs.

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add up all the DVDs: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find out how many centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to know how many hours the candle burns. 

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply 4 hours by 2 centimeters. 

4 * 2 = 8

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the other items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box.

$17 รท $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to add the cost of the shorts, pants, and shoes.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the shorts: 
3 pairs of shorts * $16.50 per pair = $49.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pants: 
3 pairs of pants * $22.50 per pair = $67.50

Now, let's add the cost of the shoes: 
$49.50 + $67.50 + $42 = $159

Mishka spent $159 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

She eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings.

Since each carton has 15 servings, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she will buy:

60 รท 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will buy 4 cartons of ice cream.

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons ร $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days."
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to know the total distance he traveled before the second stop. 

He traveled 20 miles before the first stop. 
Then, he traveled some more miles before the second stop. 
We know that the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. 
So, the total distance of the trip is 60 miles. 
If the second stop was 15 miles before the end, then the distance before the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles. 

Now, we know that he traveled 20 miles before the first stop and 45 miles before the second stop. 
So, the distance between the first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

"To find the price of the boots, we need to first find the price of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 11 = 18. 

We know that the total age of Darrell and Allen now is 162. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(7x + 11x) = 162

Combine like terms:
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age:
Allen's current age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses.

The first guess is 80.
The second guess is 20 more than half of 80, which is 40. So, the second guess is 40 + 20 = 60.
The third guess is 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the total by 3: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7.

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The answer is 35."
"To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to know how many silver coins she has. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, the sum of silver coins and gold coins is 110. 

We can write this as an equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. 

Now, we can find the number of gold coins: x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the points he scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. 
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to do some math.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. 
There are 30 days, so he eats 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.

The yogurts are on sale for 4 yogurts for $5.00. 
To find out how much one yogurt costs, we divide $5 by 4. 
$5 รท 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of one yogurt. 
60 yogurts x $1.25 = $75.

So, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how much money John had, we need to calculate how much he made from selling his lego sets. 

He sold 13 lego sets for $15 each. 
13 x 15 = 195

He spent $20 on 8 video games. 
8 x 20 = 160

He had $5 left. 
195 - 160 = 35

So, John had $35. 

Now, we need to find out how many lego sets he can buy with $35. 
Since each lego set costs $15, 
35 รท 15 = 2 with a remainder of 5.

This means John can buy 2 lego sets with the money he has left."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to first find out how many hours he runs in total. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. 
He runs half as much on the other two days, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each on those days. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we need to find out how many miles he runs per hour. 
We know he runs 60 miles in 6 hours. 
To find the speed, we divide the distance by the time: 
60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much time Dana spends running and walking. 

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running and 2/3 * 6 = 4 hours walking.

Now, let's find out how fast Dana runs. We know that she skips at 3 miles per hour, and she runs four times faster than she skips. So, she runs at 3 * 4 = 12 miles per hour.

Dana runs for 2 hours, so she travels 12 * 2 = 24 miles.

Dana walks for 4 hours, so she travels 3 * 4 = 12 miles.

In total, Dana travels 24 + 12 = 36 miles in 6 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the information given. 

First, we know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 
Then, Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
Lastly, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To find the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to add the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone to the distance the dragon can breathe fire.

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet.
Polly can throw the javelin 3 times farther with the gemstone, so she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Now, we add the distance the dragon can breathe fire to the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone: 
1000 + 1200 = 2200 feet.

So, Polly can stand 2200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

First, we need to find the total number of pieces. Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40.

Now, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still have left for the day. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since a serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight of chips you can eat. 

0.8 * 300 = 240g

So, you can eat 240g of chips."
"To find the net profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total revenue.

Total cost: 
1 pound of beeswax and wicks cost $10.00
Since Charlie makes 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.
So, the total cost is 20 pounds * $10.00/pound = $200.00

Total revenue: 
Charlie sells each candle for $2.00
He sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00

Net profit: 
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00

The net profit is -$160.00, which means Charlie is losing $160.00."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours she spent on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 x 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, so on Wednesday, she wrote 7 x 2 = 14 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 x 4 = 56 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to do some math.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. 

So, the total number of Post-it notes she used is 80 + 220 = 300.

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to add those to the total number of Post-it notes she used. 

300 + 23 = 323

So, the package she purchased had 323 Post-it notes."
"To find out how many blue ties John bought, we need to divide the amount he spent on blue ties by the price of each blue tie. 

$200 รท $40 = 5 blue ties

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 + $40 x 0.5 = $60 each.

The total amount John spent on red ties is 10 x $60 = $600.

The total amount John spent on ties is $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800.

The final answer is: 800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

48 รท 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is 15 x 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 3/4 of 120. 

3/4 of 120 is (3/4) x 120 = 90 units.

So, 90 units are occupied. 

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units. 

120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to first find out how many eggs he sells per week. 

He sells 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week. 

252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Now, we need to convert the eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen. 

1764 eggs per week / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozens per week

Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. 

147 dozens per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled. 

Since he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, that's 3 hours. 

Now, we need to find the distance he traveled. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we know the distance is 30 miles. We can use the same formula to find the time it takes to get back: time = distance / speed.

Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. So, the weight of the toys he needs to remove is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find out how many toys he needs to remove by dividing the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy. 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find out which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
6 truck tires * $60 = $360
4 car tires * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires.
12 car tires * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue is $480 - $520 = -$40. The mechanic earned $40 less on Friday."

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00. 
25% of $40.00 is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00

Now, we add the delivery fees ($3.00) and the 25% fee ($10.00) to the original bill ($40.00). 
$40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

There are 1 bad orange, 20% unripe oranges, and 2 sour oranges. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges. 
20% of 25 oranges = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the bad and sour oranges to the unripe oranges. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges that are not good.

Now, let's subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total oranges) - 8 (not good oranges) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the pension for the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years separately.

For the first 20 years, her pension is $50,000 per year.

For the remaining 10 years, her pension is 5% of the original pension value. 
The original pension value is $50,000. 
5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, her pension for the remaining 10 years is $2,500 per year.

Now, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years. 
$50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 per year.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used to fill it up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) รท 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons (remaining)

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on 3 gallons of gas. We know that she has already traveled 100 miles since the last filling. To find the miles per gallon, we can divide the miles she has traveled by the gallons she used.

100 miles รท 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we can multiply the miles per gallon by the remaining gallons in the tank to find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank.

25 miles per gallon ร 3 gallons = 75 miles

So, Sophia can drive 75 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first year.

In the first 180 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, in 180 days, she will use 180 cups of dog food.

After that, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. There are 365 days in a year, so she will use 2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups of dog food.

Total dog food used in the first year = 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to divide the total amount of dog food used by 110 cups to find out how many bags she will use.

910 cups / 110 cups per bag = 8.27 bags.

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to calculate how much each adult and child will eat.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad. 
Since there are 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad for adults is 20 x 10 = 200 lbs.

A child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for children is 5 x 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know Cindy has 4 pets. 
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 x 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 
Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 6 pets, and Jan has 18 pets. 
4 + 6 + 18 = 28

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Amy must be 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can subtract 2 seconds from Lee's time to find Gerald's original time. 
Gerald's original time = Lee's time - 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 - 2
Gerald's original time = 36 seconds

Now, we know Gerald's original time and the improvement in his speed. We can calculate his new time by adding the improvement to his original time.
Gerald's new time = Gerald's original time + 10% of Gerald's original time
Gerald's new time = 36 + 0.1 * 36
Gerald's new time = 36 + 3.6
Gerald's new time = 39.6 seconds

The final answer is 39.6"
"To find the total number of pets, we need to know the number of dogs and cats. We know there are 60 dogs. 

Since there are two cats for every dog, we multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats. 
60 * 2 = 120 cats

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. We also know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. 
First, we need to find the combined number of dogs and cats. 
60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180

Now, we subtract 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats to find the number of rabbits. 
180 - 12 = 168

Now, we have the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. To find the total number of pets, we add them together. 
60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, that means 3/5 are girls. 
3/5 of 200 is (3/5) * 200 = 120. 
So, there are 120 girls.

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
2/3 of 120 is (2/3) * 120 = 80. 
So, 80 girls are in the girl scout.

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls. 
120 - 80 = 40.

The answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of Harry's hours. 

2/3 of 9 hours is 6 hours. 

Now, we need to find the difference between Harry's hours and James' hours. 

9 hours (Harry) - 6 hours (James) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. 

Since the sauce is 32 ounces and it's half of the tomatoes, we need to multiply 32 by 2 to get the total ounces of tomatoes. 

32 * 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes.

Now, we know that each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces and contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used, we need to divide the total ounces of tomatoes by 16.

64 / 16 = 4

So, Freda used 4 cans of tomatoes. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply 4 by 3.

4 * 3 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

First, let's find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total. 
Total cars = 30
Cars that took an exit = 5
Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 20

Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = Total cars - Cars that took an exit
Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5
Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = 25

Now, we need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. 
Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = Total cars that drove through the traffic jam - Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes
Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 25 - 20
Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 5

The answer is 5."
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first find out how many potted plants she has in total. 

She has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

So, the total number of potted plants she has is: 
18 (new plants) + 2 * 40 (plants on ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

Now, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. 
There are 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had: 
98 - 40 = 58

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left."
"To find the answer, we need to follow the given information step by step.

The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
Since the first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The total number of doorbell rings is the sum of the doorbell rings of all friends. 
So, the total number of doorbell rings is 60 + 70 + 25 = 155.

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 times a day. 
So, 1 glass * 5 days = 5 glasses of water per weekday.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water on Saturday and Sunday, so that's 2 glasses of water per weekend.

Now, let's add the glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends:
5 glasses per weekday * 5 weekdays = 25 glasses
+ 2 glasses per weekend = 27 glasses

So, John drinks 27 glasses of water in a week.

"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the distance it covers in 10 minutes.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. 

42 miles / 3 miles = 14

So, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes to cover the whole city. 

14 x 10 minutes = 140 minutes

The answer is 140."
"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left, we need to follow the steps.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board. A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

So, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

So, the mom places 250 pieces on the board. Now, Poppy has 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

The answer is 500."
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 x 3 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats and the number of cookies Cody eats. 

5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20 cookies.

"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the outer dimensions.

The outer dimensions are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. 
The inner dimensions are 5 - 2 inches by 6 - 2 inches by 4 - 2 inches.

So, the inner dimensions are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

Now, we multiply the inner dimensions to find the volume:
3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the volume by 3:
24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first find out how many hours he watched in total on Wednesday. 

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 

So, the total hours he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Since he watched 7 hours in total, the hours he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1.5 hours is 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. 90 minutes divided by 30 minutes is 3. 

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year.

This year, he wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he will bake 2x cookies.

He realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine the constants: 2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides: 2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2: x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of the gas, we need to multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons.

$3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon. So, we need to multiply the cashback per gallon by the number of gallons.

$0.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback reward from the total cost of the gas.

$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each person.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2:
90 / 2 = 45

They ate 45 fruit roll-ups on average."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to know how many times Julia rowed 20 feet. 

Since the shore is 64 feet away, and Julia rowed 20 feet at a time, we divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2. Since you can't row a fraction of a time, we round down to 3 times. 

So, Julia rowed 3 times. 

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rowed 20 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet. 

We multiply 2 liters by 3 (the number of times Julia rowed 20 feet) to get 6 liters. 

The final answer is 6."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 รท 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many ducks are in the photograph.

300 รท 50 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we need to multiply the number of boards by the cost per board. 

10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we need to multiply the number of boards by the cost per board.

5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, let's add the total cost of both types of boards.

$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to find the new price of each board. 

The original price of a 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10. 
The original price of a 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16.

The new price of a 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15
The new price of a 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24

Now, let's find the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards.

10 boards * $15 per board = $150

Now, let's find the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards.

5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Now, let's add the total revenue from selling both types of boards.

$150 + $120 = $270

To find the profit, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

$270 - $180 = $90

Since the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30, we need to subtract the number of vehicles on the first day to find the number of vehicles on the second day. 

30 - 10 = 20 vehicles

Now, we know that each container has 5 vehicles. To find the number of containers on the second day, we need to divide the number of vehicles on the second day by 5.

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers

So, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then find their current salaries.

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can find Lylah's salary by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.3 (1 + 0.3).

Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. To find his current salary, we multiply his salary four years ago by 1.4 (1 + 0.4).

Adrien's current salary = $40,000 * 1.4 = $56,000

Now, we can find Lylah's current salary by multiplying her salary four years ago by 1.4.

Lylah's current salary = $30,769 * 1.4 = $43,086.6

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we need to multiply Brian's current number of video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times 15 is 45. 
45 - 5 = 40

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. 
   Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we need to divide 27 by 3.
   27 รท 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. 
   Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we need to divide 9 by 3.
   9 รท 3 = 3

So, there are 3 female Scottish unicorns."
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies. 

2 subs for $7.50 each is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips for $1.50 each is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies for $1.00 each is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's add these amounts together: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20. 
$20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip. So, we add $5.00 to the total cost: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we need to multiply the number of questions by the time he spent on it.

Questions completed in the first test = 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we do the same thing.

Questions completed in the second test = 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, let's add the questions completed in both tests.

Total questions completed = 40 + 30 = 70 questions

Since the first test had 75 questions and Mark completed 70, we need to subtract 70 from 75 to find out how many questions he left incomplete.

Questions left incomplete = 75 - 70 = 5 questions

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

First, we multiply 12 (blue gumballs) by 4: 
12 * 4 = 48

Then, we add 22 to 48:
48 + 22 = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

70"
"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The answer is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to know the number of queens first. 

Let's say the number of queens is x. 
Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of babies is 2x. 
Since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2x = 4x.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. So, the sum of worker bees, babies, and queens is 700. 
We can write this as an equation: 4x + 2x + x = 700.

Combine like terms: 7x = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens (x = 100), we can find the number of worker bees: 4x = 4 * 100 = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first find out how many hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, he would work 2 * 7 = 14 hours in a week.

Since he earns $10 an hour, he would earn 14 * 10 = $140 in a week.

The answer is 140."
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of all the items first. 

The total cost of the items is: 
2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to find 10% of 15 dollars. 
10% of 15 dollars is 1.5 dollars. 

Now, we add the tax to the total cost: 
15 + 1.5 = 16.5 dollars

The final answer is 16.5"
"To find the total expenses, we need to calculate the cost of bleach and cloths for all 8 clients. 

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach, so 8 clients will need 8 x 2 = 16 bottles of bleach. 
16 bottles of bleach will cost 16 x $2 = $32.

Each client needs 1 pack of cloths, so 8 clients will need 8 packs of cloths. 
8 packs of cloths will cost 8 x $5 = $40.

Total expenses will be $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income is $92. 
Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so profit will be $92 - $72 = $20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to first find out how many pineapples he can harvest in a month.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John has 10 hectares, so he has 10 x 100 = 1000 pineapples.

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so he can harvest his pineapples 12 / 3 = 4 times in a year.

So, John can harvest 1000 x 4 = 4000 pineapples in a year.

"To find the total number of legos, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box together: 
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

Johnny picks up 2125 legos."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, 1/2 of those bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.

So, after the first 12 hours, there are 30 bees that left initially + 15 bees that returned = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees are left in the hive before the last 6 hours. We already know that 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, and 60 bees left in the next 6 hours. So, the total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 30 + 60 = 90 bees.

Since 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, the number of bees left in the hive before the last 6 hours is 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. So, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 75 bees.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to know how much the tickets cost. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket. 

So, the total cost of the tickets is $12 + $10 = $22.

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, that means she gave the cashier $22 - $8 = $14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find out how many friends James has, we need to know how many friends Dorothy has. 

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can divide 12 by 3 to find out how many friends Dorothy has. 

12 รท 3 = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends. 

Now, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4 to find out how many friends James has. 

4 x 4 = 16

So, James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To find out who wins, we need to calculate how long it takes each person to get home.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, and he bikes at 440 feet per minute. We need to convert miles to feet first. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so 3 miles is 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet.

Now, we can divide the distance by the speed to find the time it takes Steve to get home: 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's distance is 2 miles, and he rides at 264 feet per minute. We need to convert miles to feet first. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so 2 miles is 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Now, we can divide the distance by the speed to find the time it takes Tim to get home: 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve wins the race. 

The time the winner (Steve) will be waiting for the loser (Tim) is the difference between their times: 40 - 36 = 4 minutes."
"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so 20 tires cost 20 x 0.25 = 5 dollars.

The answer is 5."
"To find out how many cookies Carl has, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies in each pack. 

10 packs * 6 cookies = 60 cookies

Now, we need to find out how much Carl spent on the cookies. 

60 cookies * $0.10 = $6

Carl paid with a $10 bill. To find the change, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the $10 bill.

$10 - $6 = $4

Carl receives $4 as change."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, Dave and the seagull ate 14 + 7 = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far is 21 + 9 = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 30) = 0 fries (since 30 - 30 = 0).
7. The ants ate 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Since the raccoon didn't eat any fries, we can ignore that step. Now, we know that 30 fries were eaten, and 5 fries were left. To find the original number of fries, we need to add the fries eaten and the fries left: 30 + 5 = 35.

The answer is: 35"
"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each. 
3 classes * 1 hour/class = 3 hours

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each. 
2 classes * 2 hours/class = 4 hours

Since there are 2 days with 3 hours and 2 days with 4 hours, we need to multiply the hours by the number of days and add them together. 
(3 hours * 3 days) + (4 hours * 2 days) = 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

So, Kimo spends 17 hours attending classes in one semester."
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each item to feet. 
- A roll is 4 inches long, so 300 rolls will be 300 * 4 = 1200 inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 1200 inches is 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.
- A croissant is 6 inches long, so 120 croissants will be 120 * 6 = 720 inches. Converting to feet, 720 inches is 720 / 12 = 60 feet.
- A baguette is 2 feet long, so 60 baguettes will be 60 * 2 = 120 feet.

Now, let's add the lengths together: 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods will be 280 feet."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to add up the bananas needed by all the apes.

The monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly amount by 2.

Monkeys: 200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas
Gorillas: 400 bananas * 2 months = 800 bananas
Baboons: 100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas

Now, let's add them up: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate how far each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Since the football field is 100 yards long, he runs 100 yards each time. So, he runs 15 x 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. So, she runs 100 + 80 = 180 yards. She does this 34 times, so she runs 180 x 34 = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is more than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest. 

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract 1500 from 6120. 6120 - 1500 = 4620.

The answer is 4620."

"Let's break it down step by step:

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's fish: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's fish: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
Total fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

- Increase: 20% of $11817.17 = 0.20 * $11817.17 = $2363.43
- New price: $11817.17 + $2363.43 = $14180.60

The final answer is: 14180.60"
"To find the cost of the action figure, we need to know the cost of one action figure. We know that one red car costs $4 and one action figure costs $5. 

Since one red car costs $4, and one action figure costs $5, we can say that one action figure is $1 more than one red car. 

Now, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. So, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we have the cost of the doll ($15), 5 red cars ($4 each), and 3 action figures ($5 each). 

The total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20. 
The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15. 

The total cost of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself. She'll lose 3 hours of work at $35/hour, so she'll lose 3 x $35 = $105.

Now, let's calculate the money she'll have if she hires the accountant. She'll pay $90 for the accountant's services.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself: $105 - $90 = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to add up the cost of all the accessories she bought.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: โฌ1090
- Scanner: โฌ157
- CD burner: โฌ74
- Printer: โฌ102

Total cost = โฌ1090 + โฌ157 + โฌ74 + โฌ102 = โฌ1423

Elvira started with โฌ1500. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from her initial budget:
โฌ1500 - โฌ1423 = โฌ77

So, Elvira will have โฌ77 left for her clothing.

77"
"To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs she needs by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

She needs 15 flans, and each flan needs 3 eggs. So, she needs 15 x 3 = 45 eggs.

She gets 9 eggs per babysitting job. To find out how many jobs she needs, we divide 45 by 9.

45 รท 9 = 5

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times."
"Let's solve the problem. 

Let Seth's age be x. 
Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Brooke's age will be x/2.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2 and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2.

The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. 
So, we can write the equation: x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

Combine like terms: 3x/2 + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x/2 = 24

Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3: x = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to follow the steps:

1. We know Ethel has $8.
2. Jimmy has 2 more than twice the money Ethel has.
3. Twice the money Ethel has is 2 x 8 = 16.
4. Jimmy has 2 more than that, so 16 + 2 = 18.

Jimmy has $18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles a day. There are 5 weekdays, so he walks 5 x 20 = 100 miles.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles a day. There are 2 days in a weekend, so he walks 2 x 10 = 20 miles.

Now, let's add the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of the uniform, we need to know the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of the uniform.
$25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

Spiders have 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so they have 80 x 8 = 640 legs.
Insects have 90 insects with 6 legs each, so they have 90 x 6 = 540 legs.
Rare mutant invertebrates have 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so they have 3 x 10 = 30 legs.

Now, let's add all the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of the four birds:
8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to first find out how much she pays each month. 

She has three debts: 
- Student loans: $300 (minimum payment) + 50% of $300 = $300 + $150 = $450
- Credit card: $200 (minimum payment) + 50% of $200 = $200 + $100 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 (minimum payment) + 50% of $500 = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up the monthly payments: 
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: 
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: 18000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to add the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, we need to convert the time to peel one potato into seconds. 
1 minute = 60 seconds
1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds

Now, we can add the time to peel and cut one potato:
90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by 60:
95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the total time into minutes:
5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first find out how many gallons they made. 

They sell 20 glasses per gallon and they made $25 in profit. Each glass costs $0.50. 

Let's find out how many glasses they sold: 
$25 / $0.50 = 50 glasses

Since they sell 20 glasses per gallon, we can divide 50 by 20 to find out how many gallons they made: 
50 / 20 = 2.5 gallons

Now, we know they made 2.5 gallons. We also know that it costs $3 for lemons per gallon. 

Let's multiply the number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon: 
2.5 * $3 = $7.50

So, they spent $7.50 on lemons.

7.50"
"To find the number of Chinese people, we need to subtract the number of Japanese people from the total number of people. 

240 (total people) - 80 (Japanese people) = 160 (Chinese people)

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.

160 (Chinese people) - 60 (Chinese boys) = 100 (Chinese girls)

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much Zaid has left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. 
   1/4 of 6000 is 600, so he spends 600 on rent.

2. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. 
   1/3 of 6000 is 2000, so he spends 2000 on car fuel.

3. The total amount spent so far is 600 + 2000 = 2600.

4. The remaining amount is 6000 - 2600 = 3400.

5. He donates half of the remaining amount to charity. 
   Half of 3400 is 1700, so he donates 1700 to charity.

6. The amount left after donation is 3400 - 1700 = 1700.

7. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, so the total amount given away is 200 + 700 = 900$.

8. The amount left after giving to his family is 1700 - 900 = 800$.

So, Zaid will have 800$ left.

800"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. 
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, let's add up the total number of crabs the three have together: 
Bo + Monic + Rani = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned, we need to add the money he earned in the first week and the second week.

Lloyd earned $10 an hour. 
He tutored 5 hours in the first week, so he earned 5 x $10 = $50.
He tutored 8 hours in the second week, so he earned 8 x $10 = $80.

Now, let's add the money he earned in both weeks: $50 + $80 = $130.

Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of 80.

3/4 of 80 is 60.

So, the winner got 60 votes.

To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's say the number of white carnations is x. 

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. So, we can set up the equation 5x = 200.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5. x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. The number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Since Sandra needs the missing red roses to be delivered by 5 pm, we need to find out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm. The answer is 160."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years.
   So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.
3. Since then, Mark is 20 + 2 = 22 years old now.
4. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how long it will take the less well-rounded team to complete the 4x400 meter relay, we need to calculate the time for each runner.

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first runner, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the times for all four runners: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per runner, so we multiply 55 by 4: 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes (2, 4, and 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (6).

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Since both probabilities are the same, the difference between them is 0.

However, to express it as a percentage, we can calculate the difference as a percentage of the smaller probability.

Difference percentage = (0.5 - 0.5) / 0.5 * 100 = 0%

The final answer is 0."

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first find out how many pieces of straw were given to the rats and hamsters. 

We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster got 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

We also know that there are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits. 

So, the total number of straw pieces given to rats and hamsters is 50 + 20 = 70.

We know that the total number of straw pieces distributed is 160. So, the number of straw pieces left for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can divide 90 by 6 to find out how many rats there are. 

90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages, we can divide 15 by 3 to find out how many rats are in each cage.

15 / 3 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of $100, which is 0.02 x $100 = $2. 

Since Mandy paid the money after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. 

The interest for 1 month is $2, so for 3 months it will be $2 x 3 = $6.

Now, we add the interest to the original amount: $100 + $6 = $106.

So, Mandy should give $106 to Benedict.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's say the trader bought x bags of wheat.

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).

The cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).

The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold for $30).

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $30x - $22x = $8x.

We know that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

$8x = $400

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = $400 / 8
x = 50

So, the trader bought 50 bags of wheat.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 x 40g = 1000g.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.

There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 x 20g = 1600g.

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together: 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The bag of candy weighs 2600g."
"Let's break it down step by step:

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought, we add the cakes from each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Half a dozen is 6. 
   The cost of 6 plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   20 dozen is 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 
   So, the cost of 240 cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 240 cups by 240.
   $34800 / 240 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"To find out how much Sara needs for the jacket and shoes, we need to add the cost of the jacket and the cost of 2 pairs of shoes.

Jacket: $30
Shoes: 2 * $20 = $40
Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already had $10 saved. So, she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Sara earns $5 for babysitting and $4 for mowing the lawn. We need to find out how many times she needs to babysit or mow the lawn to get $60.

Let's try babysitting first:
$5 * 12 = $60

Since $5 * 12 is more than $60, Sara can afford the jacket and shoes by babysitting 12 times.

We don't need to check mowing the lawn because Sara can afford the jacket and shoes by babysitting 12 times.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3r + 5w.

Since w = r + 2, we can substitute this into the equation 3r + 5w. This gives us 3r + 5(r + 2).

Now, we can simplify the equation: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42. Combining like terms, we get 8r + 10 = 42.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8r = 32.

Dividing both sides by 8, we get r = 4.

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to find the perimeter of the park first. The perimeter of a rectangle is the distance around it. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. 

Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5) 
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we know that Gary walks 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we need to divide the perimeter by his walking speed.

Time = Perimeter / Speed 
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour 
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to know how many customers she counted on the first day. 

Let's say the number of customers on the first day is x. 

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the third day is 500. We know that the total number of customers on the first two days is the sum of the customers on the first day and the second day. 

So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms: 2x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides: 2x = 450

Divide both sides by 2: x = 225

So, Sloane counted 225 customers on the first day. 

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we add 50 to the number of customers on the second day. 

The number of customers on the second day is 225 + 50 = 275. 

The number of customers on the third day is 275 + 50 = 325.

The final answer is 325."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons in 4 minutes, and the big pool lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons in 4 minutes.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now, and the small pool has x gallons of water now.

We know that the big pool lost 16 gallons, so 4x - 16 = 4x. This means the big pool still has the same amount of water it had 4 minutes ago, which is 2x.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to add the cost of the shoes and the belt together. 

$320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total amount she needs ($352.00) by her hourly wage ($8.00) to find out how many hours she needs to work.

$352.00 รท $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase."
"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, we first need to calculate 10% of the initial amount she borrowed. 

10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200.

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (10% of the initial amount) = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 a month for 12 months, we need to calculate how much she has paid in total.

$165 x 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the amount she has paid from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance.

$2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"

"To find the ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to know Harriet's age. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Now, we know Harriet's age and Zack's age. We also know that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. 
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we have the ages of all three: 
- Harriet's age: 21
- Zack's age: 42
- Adrian's age: 63

To find the average age, we add the ages and divide by 3. 
Average age = (Harriet's age + Zack's age + Adrian's age) / 3
Average age = (21 + 42 + 63) / 3
Average age = 126 / 3
Average age = 42

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age: 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack's age: 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian's age: 63 + 3 = 66

Now, we find the average age in three years:
Average age in three years = (Harriet's age in three years + Zack's age in three years + Adrian's age in three years) / 3
Average age in three years = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age in three years = 135 / 3
Average age in three years = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores. 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points of all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points of the other three students from the total points. 
251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards left.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

Now, the total number of cards is 90 - 8 = 82 (since he lost 8 cards) and 90 + 14 = 104 (since he bought 14 cards), but we will use 90 + 14 = 104 for the calculation.

The chance of picking a water type card is 32 (water type cards) / 104 (total cards) = 0.3077.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.3077 * 100 = 30.77.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 31%.

The final answer is 31."
"To find out how much Chad owes, we need to add up the cost of everything he ordered.

The base burrito is $6.50.
He adds extra meat for $2.00, so now it's $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50.
He adds extra cheese for $1.00, so now it's $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50.
He adds avocado for $1.00, so now it's $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50.
He adds 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so that's $0.50, and now it's $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so now it's $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so he will pay $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Chad owes $9.00."
"To find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to know how many pieces Kalinda's mom can place per minute. 

Since Kalinda's mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The farm started with 120 baby watermelons.
2. 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so Ashlyn took 30% of 120, which is 0.3 x 120 = 36 watermelons.
3. After taking 36 watermelons, there are 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.
4. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. 3/4 of 84 is 0.75 x 84 = 63 watermelons.
5. So, 63 watermelons were harvested, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons that were not ready to be harvested.

The answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we need to do a few steps.

First, we need to find the total cost of the cars. 
12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000

Next, we need to find the tax. 
10% of $240,000 is 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000

Now, we need to add the registration cost. 
$24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (12 cars * $1000) = $36,000

So, the total cost is $240,000 + $36,000 = $276,000

"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week he eats 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we know that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes he eats in a week by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce.

Steve eats 42 tomatoes per week, and one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. So, Steve needs 42 / 3 = 14 vines.

The answer is 14."

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to know how many letters he receives and sends. 

He was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being penpals with 2 of them. So, he is now penpals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each person sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, he also sends 2 letters a week. 

In total, Mike receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters a week and sends 3 * 2 = 6 letters a week.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike receives 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week and sends 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, he can write 30 pages in 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate how many minutes he used for his daily call with his boss.

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

Now, let's add the minutes used for his daily call and the extra minutes: 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Jason's phone plan is 1000 minutes per month. He used 750 minutes. To find out how many minutes he has left, we need to subtract 750 from 1000: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 fries.
4. Now, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
5. Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
6. Since Griffin had 27 fries in the end, Ginger must have given him 27 - 9 - 2 = 16 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

The problem states that this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can write an equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then multiply it by the hourly rate.

She works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, so the total hours worked per week is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 * 5 = 120 hours.

The hourly rate is $250, so the total amount paid is 120 * 250 = $30,000.

However, she gets a 10% discount, so we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 10% of $30,000, which is 0.1 * 30,000 = $3,000.

The final amount paid is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

"Let's break it down step by step:

Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. 
So, her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies in total.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. 
So, Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. 
So, Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies in total.

Now, let's calculate the calories:
Sue ate 46 cookies, and each cookie has 200 calories. 
So, Sue consumed 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 18 cookies, and each cookie has 200 calories. 
So, her sister consumed 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to know the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can find the total number of girls by multiplying 50% by 3. 

50% of 3 classes = 0.5 * 3 = 1.5

Since we can't have half a person, we can round it to 1.5 * 2 = 3 girls in total. 

Now, we know the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls. 

So, the third class has 3 - 27 = -24 girls. But we can't have a negative number of girls. 

Let's recheck the calculation. 

The total number of girls in the school is 3 classes * 50% = 1.5. We can round it to 3 girls. 

The first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls. 

So, the third class has 3 - 27 = -24 girls. 

Let's recheck the total number of girls in the school. 

The first class has 20 students, and 15 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5. 

The second class has 20 students, and 12 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8. 

The total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60 students (3 classes * 20 students per class). 

50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls. 

The total number of girls in the first two classes is 27. 

So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3. 

Now, we know the third class has 3 girls. 

The total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students. 

Since the school is 50% boys, the total number of boys in the school is 50% of 60 students. 

50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys. 

The first class has 20 students, and 5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 5 = 15. 

The second class has 20 students, and 8 of them are boys. So, the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 8 = 12. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 15 + 8 = 23. 

So, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 23 = 7.

20 dimes are worth 10 cents each, so 20 dimes are worth 20 * 10 = 200 cents.
40 dollar bills are worth 1 dollar each, so 40 dollar bills are worth 40 * 1 = 40 dollars.

Now, let's add all the values together:
100 cents + 200 cents + 200 cents + 4000 cents = 2500 cents

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we can convert 2500 cents to dollars by dividing by 100:
2500 / 100 = 25

So, Brady has 25 dollars in his piggy bank.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we need to multiply the number of houses by the number of bedrooms in each house and then multiply by the number of windows in each bedroom.

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house = 6 bedrooms
6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows in the bedrooms

Now, let's add the additional windows in each house. 
4 windows per house * 2 houses = 8 windows

Total windows = 12 windows in the bedrooms + 8 windows in the additional windows
Total windows = 20 windows

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to add the prices of the items together.

Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35
Total cost: $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99 + $1.00 (rounding to the nearest dollar) = $15.99

The total cost is $15.99. 

The mother paid $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

$20 - $15.99 = $4.01

The cashier gives the mother $4.01 in change."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and rosette take.

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. To find out how many stitches the two sleeves take, we subtract the total stitches of the collar and rosette from the total stitches of the sweater: 1800 - 90 - 180 = 1530 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches of the sleeves by 2: 1530 / 2 = 765 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 765."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of packets of each type of seed by its price and then add them together.

For tomato seeds: 20 packets * $40 = $800
For celery seeds: 80 packets * $30 = $2400

Now, let's add them together: $800 + $2400 = $3200

The total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines in each scene and the song.

The song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. But only a third of them are Sean's lines, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of them are Sean's lines, so he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find out how many cards had the letter D, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we find out how many cards had the letter A on them: 2/5 of 80 cards = 2/5 * 80 = 32 cards
2. Now, we subtract the cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48 cards
3. Then, we find out how many cards had the letter B on them: 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = 1/2 * 48 = 24 cards
4. Now, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter C on them: 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = 5/8 * 24 = 15 cards
6. Now, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9 cards

So, the cards with the letter D on them are 9.

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. 

Let's say Mico's age is x and Marco's age is 20 - x. 

We know that the sum of their ages is 20, so we can write an equation: 
x + (20 - x) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:
20 = 20

This means that Mico and Marco are the same age. 

Now, let's find their current ages. Since they are the same age, we can say that x = 10. 

So, Mico's age is 10 and Marco's age is 10.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be 10 + 10 = 20 and Marco's age will be 10 + 10 = 20.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"Let's say Sam's current age is x. 

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is 6x.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be 6x + 9 and Sam's age will be x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. 

So, we can write the equation: 
6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Simplifying the equation:
6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtracting 3x from both sides:
3x + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
x = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the number of spots on the mambas, we need to divide the number of cobras by 2 since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. 

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we know that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas. 

Total number of spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800
Total number of spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100

Total number of spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half of the total number of spots = 4900 / 2 = 2450

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we need to calculate the total number of people. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so 12 + 3 = 15 people. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so 15 * 2 = 30 guests. 

In total, there are 15 + 30 = 45 people. 

Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy needs 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

Maddy needs 15 pizzas. Each pizza costs $15, so Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225."
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to first find out how much space is taken up by the topaz gemstones. 

There are 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long. So, the total space taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

Since the necklace is 25 inches long, we need to subtract the space taken up by the gemstones from the total length to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads. 

25 - 8 = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many beads fit in 17 inches, we need to divide 17 by 1/4.

17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories, we need to add the number of stories each person wrote in the first week and then double it for the second week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add the number of stories they wrote in the second week:
40 (Alani) + 80 (Braylen) + 120 (Margot) = 240 stories

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 240."

"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to first calculate how much money she has in total. 

She has 5 quarters, and each quarter is 25 cents. So, 5 quarters is 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents. So, 2 dimes is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the money she has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we need to subtract 55 cents from 145 cents: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 x 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 stars. 
Now, we add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows: 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 
Since the flag has 76 stars in total, we subtract the stars from the 8-star and 6-star rows: 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 
Now, we divide the remaining stars by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows: 40 รท 5 = 8. 

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, so the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we know the distance covered by the car in the fast lane is 480 miles. To find the time taken, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"Let's break it down step by step:

Ali has 22 medals. 
Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem says they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means they have 1/10 of the total medals given out.

Let's call the total number of medals given out ""x"". We know that 39 is 1/10 of x, so we can set up the equation:

39 = (1/10)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting.

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are there in total, we need to multiply the number of packets by the number of chocolate bars in each packet. 

8 packets * 5 chocolate bars = 40 chocolate bars

Since 4 adults get 6 chocolate bars each, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are given to the adults. 

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars. 

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

There are 16 chocolate bars left to be shared among the children. Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children. 

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child"
"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. 
3 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 180 minutes

She pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes.
180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 minutes by 10.
150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

So, Susan earns $5 * 15 = $75 for the online task.

1. Mike has 21 points.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
3. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 x 21 = 42 points.
4. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
   - Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
   - Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point: 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all three players:
Mike: 22 points

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat twice a day (lunch and dinner). So, each person eats 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

There are 5 people in the household, so the total rice consumption per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total rice consumption per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg = 3 weeks

"To find out how much John pays for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven and the total cost of the miles driven.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per week:
He drives to work and back, so that's 2 trips per day. 
He goes to work 5 days a week, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 trips per week.
Since the work is 30 miles away, he drives 30 x 2 = 60 miles per week.

Now, let's calculate the total miles driven per year:
There are 50 weeks in a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 x 50 = 3000 miles.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
He is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of the miles driven is 3000 x $2 = $6000.

Now, let's add the monthly bonus:
He gets a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 x 12 = $1800.

So, we have 16 pairs of pages. 

Since each pair has two pages, we need 16 * 2 = 32 pages. 

However, we are asked about a 32-page tabloid. 

A 32-page tabloid means we have 32 pages, but we need to consider that the last page is on the right front. 

So, we need 16 pairs of pages, and the last page is on the right front.

6 business suits at $100 each = 6 x $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 x $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 x $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find out how many people came to Martha's party, we need to first find out how many people were invited. 

There were 2 families with 6 people, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
There were 3 families with 4 people, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
In total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
1/4 of 8 is 2, so 2 people had previous commitments. 
So, 8 - 2 = 6 people couldn't come.

Now, we subtract the people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited. 
24 - 6 = 18 people.

The answer is 18."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to do a few steps.

First, we need to find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Solomon bought 20 marbles, so his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8). 20 + 8 = 28 marbles.

The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store is 50 + 28 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by 2 to find the total weight. 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first. 

The formula for volume is length x width x height. 

So, the volume of the pool is 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet.

Since it costs $.1 per cubic foot, the total cost is 120 x $.1 = $12.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to find the number of girls and nongendered children first.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, we multiply 30 by 3 to get the number of girls: 
30 * 3 = 90 girls

Since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, we multiply 30 by 1/10 to get the number of nongendered children:
30 * 1/10 = 3 nongendered children

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to get the total number of children:
30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the number of electric poles, we need to know that the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3. 

Let's say the number of poles is x. 
Since the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, the number of wires will be 3x. 

We are given that the total number of wires is 45. 
So, 3x = 45 
x = 45 / 3 
x = 15 

The number of poles required is x, which is 15."
"To find out how many people left, we need to find the total number of people first. 

There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people is 25 + 15 = 40.

1/4 of the people left, so we need to find 1/4 of 40. 
1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10.

So, 10 people left the party. 

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were 25 men initially, 25 - 22 = 3 men left.

We know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

There were 15 women initially, and 7 left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the information given:

1. The magazine costs half as much as the book. 
   Since the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine. 
   So, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The pen costs $1."
"To find out how many pencils Jam has in total, we need to add the pencils in the boxes and the loose pencils. 

Since we don't know how many pencils are in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

We know that Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2.

We also know that Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is 3x + 2 + 46.

We are told that the total number of pencils is 26. So, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 48 = 26
3x = -22
x = -22 / 3
x = -7.33 (we can't have a fraction of a pencil, so this doesn't make sense)

However, let's recheck the equation. We made a mistake. The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is 3x + 2 + 46, but we are told that the total number of pencils is 26. This means that Meg has 26 - 2 = 24 pencils. 

Now, we know that Meg has 24 pencils and Jam has 2 loose pencils. So, Jam must have 24 - 2 = 22 pencils in the boxes. 

Since Jam has 3 boxes, we can divide 22 by 3 to find out how many pencils are in each box:
22 / 3 = 7.33 (we can't have a fraction of a pencil, so this doesn't make sense)

However, let's recheck the division. We made another mistake. The correct division is:
22 / 3 = 7 with a remainder of 1. This means that 2 boxes have 7 pencils each and 1 box has 1 pencil.

So, Jam has 2 boxes with 7 pencils each and 1 box with 1 pencil.

The total number of boxes Jam has is 2 + 1 = 3 boxes.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how much weaker the coffee is, we need to calculate the total cooling effect and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the cooling effect. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to divide 65 by 13 to find out how many ice cubes were used.

65 รท 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes were used. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so we multiply 5 by 12.

5 x 12 = 60 milliliters

Now, let's add the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The coffee is 60 milliliters weaker, and we add 15 milliliters of cream, so we subtract 15 from 60.

60 - 15 = 45 milliliters

The coffee is 45 milliliters weaker.

45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got. We know that they got 7 new records in total. 

Since they got 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, we can divide 7 by 2 to find out how many old records they traded. 

7 รท 2 = 3.5

Since you can't trade half a record, we can round down to 3. This means they traded 3 sets of 2 old records for 3 new records. 

Now, we need to find out how many old records they brought in. Since they traded 3 sets of 2 old records, we multiply 3 by 2.

3 x 2 = 6

So, the 5 people brought in 6 old records.

"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of 100. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

So, there are 40 junior programmers. 

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the number of senior programmers. 

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 40
Senior programmers = Total employees - Junior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month. 

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer)
Total amount = (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
Total amount = $80000 + $144000
Total amount = $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people at the third stop.

First, let's find out how many people were on the bus at the second stop. We know that 7 people got off and 8 more got in, so the number of people at the second stop is 20 - 7 + 8 = 21.

Now, we know that 5 people got on at the first stop. So, the number of people at the first stop is 21 - 5 = 16.

Now, we know that 5 people got on at the first stop. So, the number of people at the terminal is 16 + 5 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Then, he passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we need to find out how many 3-minute intervals are there in 40% charge.

40% of 100 minutes is 40. So, we divide 40 by 1 (since it recharges 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes) and multiply by 3 to get the total minutes.

40 / 1 * 3 = 120 minutes

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, we divide 120 minutes by 60 to get the total hours.

120 / 60 = 2 hours

The answer is 2."
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to do some simple math.

Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so we need to subtract 3 from 17. 
17 - 3 = 14

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to follow the steps:

1. The customer spent $80 initially.
2. They used their rewards for $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got $80 / 20 = 4 rewards.
3. The rewards are $1 off for every $20, so 4 rewards are $4 off.
4. The customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off.
5. Now, we subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the initial amount: $80 - $4 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To find the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total amount of taxes first. 

The total amount of taxes for Job A is 20% of $15 * 2000 hours = 0.2 * 15 * 2000 = $6000. 

The net pay for Job A is $15 * 2000 - $6000 = $3000.

For Job B, we need to calculate the net income first. The property tax is $6000, and the net income is $42,000 - $6000 = $38,000. 

The total amount of taxes for Job B is 10% of $38,000 = 0.1 * 38,000 = $3800.

The net pay for Job B is $38,000 - $3800 = $32,200.

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $32,200 - $3000 = $29,200.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then the price after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 x $8 = $64.

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. This means the new price is 150% of the original price, or 1.5 times the original price. So, the new price is $8 x 1.5 = $12.

Now, Maria has 8 shares worth $12 each, so the total value is 8 x $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. This means the new price is 75% of the previous price, or 0.75 times the previous price. So, the new price is $12 x 0.75 = $9.

Now, Maria has 8 shares worth $9 each, so the total value is 8 x $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."

"To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's start by calling the number of students in the two equal-sized groups 'x'. 

Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'. 

We know that the total number of students is 200, and there are 3 groups. So, the sum of the students in all three groups is 200. 

We can write this as an equation: 
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of students in the smallest group: 
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how many chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, we know he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's say the number of cows is x. Then the number of chickens is 2x. 

We know that the total number of animals is 60. So, we can write an equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20.

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 2x = 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. 
The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 240 pounds

"To find the difference in the amount of money they make per day, we need to calculate the money they made from tractors and silos.

They made $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made 10 x $100 = $1000 per day from tractors.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make 5 x $220 = $1100 per day from silos.

The total amount of money they make per day now is $1100 + $1000 = $2100.

To find the percentage increase, we need to find the difference between the new amount and the old amount, and divide it by the old amount.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, and each show was 2 hours long, so he spent 3 x 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

Now, let's add up the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent. To find the total time, we need to divide 15 by 30% (or 0.3). 

15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find out how much time he spent sightseeing. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we need to multiply 50 by 40% (or 0.4).

Since each friend will cost $5 (for the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides), we can divide $60 by $5 to find out how many friends she can invite:
$60 รท $5 = 12

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party."
"Marisa gets $5 every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. 25 cents is $0.25. 4 lollipops cost 4 x $0.25 = $1. 

She saves the change, so she saves $5 - $1 = $4. 

She does this for 5 days. $4 x 5 = $20. 

The answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. 
   He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so he spent 40 x 0.05 = $2.

2. Since Billy took half of his change, he must have had $2 left. 
   This means he had $2 initially, so he must have had $4 before buying gumballs.

3. Billy spent $4 on gumballs and $10 on candy, so he must have spent $4 + $10 = $14 in total.

4. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the total amount spent on candy ($14) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find out how many pounds of candy he bought.
   $14 รท $1.5 = 9.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 9.33 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Carver's son is x years old. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Now, let's add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2:

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the distance from the third city to the first city, we need to add the distances from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 75 + 100 = 175 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance of the trip. 
Total distance = 75 + 100 + 175 = 350 miles

The train does this trip 3 times a day. 
Total distance per day = 3 * 350 = 1050 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. 
To find the number of days between services, we need to divide the total distance by the distance between services. 
Number of days between services = 18,000 / 1050 = 17.14

So, the train goes between services approximately 17 days. 

The final answer is 17."
"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs, we need to calculate the amount for each type of bed.

A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds. 
So, the average amount is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 x 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
For 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 x 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing."
"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home.

Distance to his friend's house: 200 miles
Detour: 10 miles
Total distance to his friend's house: 200 + 10 = 210 miles

Distance back home: 240 miles

Total distance traveled: 210 + 240 = 450 miles

To find the time taken for the trip, we need to divide the total distance by the speed.

Time taken to his friend's house: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours
Time taken back home: 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Total time taken: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The trip took 6 hours."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is 3. 

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5, which is 4 * 3 - 5 = 7.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which is 3 * 7 = 21.

We know that the total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up an equation:

3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + x (other reasons) = 50

Combine the known numbers: 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Now, subtract 31 from 50 to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons: 50 - 31 = 19

The final answer is 19."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can multiply Sara's points by 3. 
3 * 8 = 24

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of gift and add them together.

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors need picture frames that cost $20 each. 
   44 x $20 = $880

2. Etching: Each picture frame needs to be etched with a logo for an additional 20% of the cost. 
   20% of $20 is 0.20 x $20 = $4
   So, the total cost for etching is $4 per frame. 
   44 x $4 = $176

3. Pins: 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. 
   2 x $5 = $10

4. Cords: 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. 
   11 x $12 = $132

3 hours (Tuesdays) + 4 hours (Saturdays) = 7 hours.

Hallie had 7 hours of dance practice per week."
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment.

40% of the total number of equipment is faulty, so we need to find 40% of 400000.

40% of 400000 = 0.4 * 400000 = 160000

This means 160000 pieces of equipment are faulty. 

Now, we need to find the number of functioning pieces of equipment. 

Total number of equipment = 400000
Number of faulty equipment = 160000
Number of functioning equipment = Total number of equipment - Number of faulty equipment
= 400000 - 160000
= 240000

Now, we need to find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment. 

Since the total cost of the equipment is $400000 and 40% of the equipment is faulty, the cost of functioning equipment is 60% of the total cost.

60% of 400000 = 0.6 * 400000 = 240000

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240000."

"To find out how much profit Millie will make per hour, we need to first find out how many cups of lemonade she sells in total. 

She buys supplies for 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. So, she has 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. So, she makes 36 x $1 = $36 from selling all the lemonade.

She spends $18 on supplies. To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the total amount she makes. So, her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we need to divide the total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade. Since we don't know how many hours she sells lemonade, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade.

She has 36 cups of lemonade and sells 4 cups per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide 36 by 4. 36 รท 4 = 9 hours.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to find the total amount of land he had before selling 3/5 of it.

Let's say the total amount of land he had is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of it, that means he sold 3/5 * x hectares.

The amount of land he has left is 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * x hectares.

We know that the amount of land he has left is 12.8 hectares. So, we can set up the equation:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * 5/2
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find out how much energy Mel uses in a day, we need to multiply the power of the air conditioner (900 watts) by the number of hours it's used (8 hours).

900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, we can convert 7200 watt-hours to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1000.

7200 watt-hours / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatt-hours

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

The new energy usage per day will be:
900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours
Converting this to kilowatt-hours:
2700 watt-hours / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatt-hours

To find the energy saved per day, we subtract the new energy usage from the old energy usage:
7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours

Now, to find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:
4.5 kilowatt-hours * 30 = 135 kilowatt-hours

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up all the stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

First, let's add up the stripes:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
- A zebra with 36 stripes.
- Another zebra with half of 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add them all up: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 3 zebras. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To find out how many muffaletta sandwiches Tyson needs to make, we need to divide the total number of people (20) by the number of people each sandwich serves (4). 

20 รท 4 = 5

So, Tyson needs to make 5 muffaletta sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Since he needs 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost:
5 x $7.00 = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost:
5 x $3.00 = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50."
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 40 - 40 = 0 corns.

Now, we know Allan has 40 cannolis and 0 corns. To find the total number of cannolis and corns, we add them together: 40 + 0 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he already took from the total steps he wants to take.

Elliott wants to take 10,000 steps.
He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
He also did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
So, he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps so far.

Now, he has 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps left.
He only has 2,000 steps left after his jog.

So, he took 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 2,000"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by the number of words he can read per minute.

The book is 45 pages long and has 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 x 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish the book.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, so he will arrive 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee is paid $15 per hour for 40 hours. So, the total amount paid to the employees in May is:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, 3/4 of the employees stayed. 
3/4 of 40 employees is 30 employees. 
The total amount paid to the employees in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid to the employees in the two months is:
$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

42,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. She bought 2 pounds, but the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, she paid for 2 pounds, but got 1 pound for free. The cost of the taffy is 2 x $3 = $6.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 x $0.25 = $1. So, the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets. $6 + $2.50 = $8.50.

Sally had $10 initially. She spent $8.50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost from the initial amount. $10 - $8.50 = $1.50.

The final answer is: $1.50"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to do the following steps:

1. First, we need to find the cost of the second package of fireworks. It's worth twice as much as the first one, so it's 2 x $400 = $800.

2. Now, we need to add the cost of the first and second packages. $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. Next, we need to find 20% of $1200. 20% of $1200 is 0.2 x $1200 = $240.

4. Now, we need to subtract the 20% discount from the total cost of the first two packages. $1200 - $240 = $960.

5. Finally, we need to add the cost of the finale firework to the total. $960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

She eats 2 cookies a night, so in 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 cookies, we need to divide 60 cookies by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 รท 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days."
"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find 5% of 5% of 50000.

First, find 5% of 50000: 
5% of 50000 = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500

Then, find 5% of 2500 (which is the number of candles that smell like wet dog):
5% of 2500 = 0.05 * 2500 = 125

So, 125 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

The final answer is: 125"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20. Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total regular price is 4 x $20 = $80.

The discount is 30% of the total regular price. To find 30% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.3. 

$80 x 0.3 = $24

Now, we subtract the discount from the total regular price to find the total cost of the discounted blouses.

$80 - $24 = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact amount yet.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

Since they have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

So, Joanne gathered 395 apples from the average trees."
"To find the number of dromedaries, we need to subtract the number of camels from the total number of heads. 

Since camels have 2 humps, we can assume that the number of camels is half of the total number of bumps (because each camel has 2 bumps). 

Number of camels = Total bumps / 2
Number of camels = 304 / 2
Number of camels = 152

Now, we subtract the number of camels from the total number of heads to find the number of dromedaries.

Number of dromedaries = Total heads - Number of camels
Number of dromedaries = 180 - 152
Number of dromedaries = 28

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 200 kilometers/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next 2 days:
Distance = 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers

Now, let's add the distance Tom traveled on the 5th day (which was 0 kilometers) and the distance he traveled during the second week:
Distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + (300 * 7) = 800 + 240 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers

So, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find Timothy's locker size, we need to know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is 40."
"To find the answer, we need to know the elevation of Stanley's comb. We know that Stanley was at 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. So, the elevation of the comb is 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Now, Oliver is at 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet he needs to climb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the elevation of the comb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

The final answer is: 3,000"
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the money he got from the two banks to the money he already had.

He initially had $5000.
The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so that's 2 x $4000 = $8000.
Now, let's add the money he got from the two banks to the money he already had: $5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $14000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $14000 in capital.

"To find out how many cats were left, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and took 5 cats each. So, 4 x 5 = 20 cats were taken away.
2. Now, we have 50 - 20 = 30 cats left.
3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and divide by 5.
   3/5 of 30 = (30 x 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18
4. So, 18 cats ran away, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

The answer is 12."
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the last 20 months.

The first 6 months cost 6 x $8 = $48.
The next 8 months cost 8 x $12 = $96.
The last 20 months cost 20 x $14 = $280.

Now, let's add the costs together: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424.

The final answer is: 424"
"To find the cost of the jogger jeans, we need to first find the total cost of the jeans. 

The total cost of the jeans is the sum of the cost of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation:

Tattered jeans + (Tattered jeans - 6) = Total cost
28 + (28 - 6) = Total cost
28 + 22 = Total cost
50 = Total cost

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up an equation to find the original cost of the jeans:

Original cost of tattered jeans + Original cost of jogger jeans - Total cost = 6
28 + (28 - 6) - 50 = 6
28 + 22 - 50 = 6
0 = 6

This equation doesn't make sense, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that 2/3 of the savings came from the tattered jeans. 

Let's say the original cost of the tattered jeans is x. Then, the original cost of the jogger jeans is x - 6. 

The total savings is $6. We know that 2/3 of the savings came from the tattered jeans, so we can set up an equation:

(2/3) * (x - 6) = 6
(2/3) * x - 4 = 6
(2/3) * x = 10
x = 15

So, the original cost of the tattered jeans is $15. 

The original cost of the jogger jeans is $15 - 6 = $9.

The difference between the original cost of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to add the capacity of all the vehicles.

4 buses can hold 60 employees each, so 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

6 minibusses can hold 30 employees each, so 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

10 minivans can hold 15 employees each, so 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all the vehicles: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to first find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since Lillian bought 3 of them, the total number of birds from these feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. So, they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. Since she made 3 of them, the total number of birds from these feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds from both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find the price of the soup, we need to calculate 25% of the bagel's price. 

25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1. 

So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half of the bagel's price, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Aleksandra needs to pay $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11 for the dinner."
"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to know how much money he had before buying the ticket. 

Kenny had $50 in spending cash and he spent $100 on the ticket. So, he had $100 - $50 = $50 left. 

Since he sells his cards for $1.5 each and he has $50, we can divide $50 by $1.5 to find out how many cards he sold. 

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

Since you can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to 33 cards. 

Now, we know Kenny sold 33 cards. He kept 1/3 of his cards, so he must have had 33 * 3 = 99 cards initially. 

The final answer is 99."
"To find out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared, we need to calculate half of 36, which is 18. Since the caterer prepared 18 hotdogs, and 40 guests showed up, we can see that 40 is more than 18. 

Since everyone wanted a second hotdog, the caterer had to give out 40 hotdogs in total. This means the caterer had 40 - 18 = 22 extra hotdogs. 

Since the caterer prepared 18 hotdogs for the first round, and 40 guests showed up, the caterer gave out 40 hotdogs. This means 40 - 18 = 22 guests got a second hotdog. 

To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the number of guests who got a second hotdog from the total number of guests. 

40 (total guests) - 22 (guests who got a second hotdog) = 18

The answer is 18."
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items first. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00. 
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00. 
The cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20% of $165.00. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The total cost after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother. 

2 + 16 = 18

Dora needs 19 - 18 = 1 more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew, we need to calculate three quarters of 100. 

Three quarters of 100 is 100 * 3/4 = 75.

Now, we know Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. One-fifth of 150 is 150 * 1/5 = 30.

The answer is 30."
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to divide 15 gallons by 5 containers. 

15 รท 5 = 3 gallons

3 ร 8 = 24 pints

So, Josey needed 24 pints of gasoline.

24"
"To find out how much money George spent, we need to subtract the money he had left from the money he started with. 

George started with $5 and had 1% left, which is 0.01 * 5 = $0.05. So, he spent 5 - 0.05 = $4.95.

Since the chips cost 40 cents each, we can divide 4.95 by 0.40 to find out how many bags of chips he bought. 4.95 / 0.40 = 12.375. Since you can't buy a fraction of a bag, we round down to 12 bags of chips.

Now, we need to find out how much money George spent on candy bars. He spent $4.95 and bought 12 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so he spent 12 * 0.40 = $4.80 on chips. 

Now, subtract the money spent on chips from the total money spent. 4.95 - 4.80 = 0.15. This is the money spent on candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide 0.15 by 0.75 to find out how many candy bars he bought. 0.15 / 0.75 = 0.2. Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 0.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many lollipops each friend got, we need to first find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we need to divide 20 by 4.

20 รท 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

5"
"To find out how much the remaining cake weighs, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom ate from the total weight of the cake.

The cake weighs 20 ounces. 
Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces in total. 
2 pieces * 1 ounce per piece = 2 ounces

56 รท 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the onions, we need to multiply the weight of the onions by the price per pound. Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, and they are on sale for $2.00 a pound. 

2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00

Antoine likes to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. 

4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00

Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and they are on sale for $2.00 a box. 

2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00

Now, we need to find the total cost of the ingredients. 

$8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so we need to divide the total cost by 6 to find the cost per serving. 

$12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. 

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it will take Bernadette 4 x 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter, we need to know the length and width of the room. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in 1 yard, so 3 yards is 3 x 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for area: Area = Length x Width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. 

360 = 9 x Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we know the length and width, we can find the perimeter. The formula for perimeter is Perimeter = 2 x (Length + Width). 

Perimeter = 2 x (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 x 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. 
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth.

"To find the final temperature, we need to follow the steps:

1. The house starts at 40 degrees.
2. Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. 
   So, the temperature increases by 3 x 5 = 15 degrees.
   The new temperature is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

3. Then, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. 
   The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. 
   Since 30 minutes is 3 x 10 minutes, the house cools down by 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.
   The new temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to do the swim and the bike ride.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so we need to find 10% of 40 minutes. 
10% of 40 minutes is 4 minutes. 
So, James finishes the swim 4 minutes faster than Jon. 
James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike ride time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike ride time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know Jon won by 10 minutes. This means James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. 
Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 
James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to find James' run time. We know James' swim time and bike time, so we can find James' total time for the swim and bike. 
James' total time for the swim and bike is 36 + 85 = 121 minutes. 
James' run time is 180 - 121 = 59 minutes.

The answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B. 

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

We know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The horse runs at 32 miles per hour and runs for 30 minutes. We need to convert 30 minutes to hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 32 * 0.5
Distance = 16 miles

The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. Since the horse runs 16 miles, it eats 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

A bail of hay costs $3. So, 8 bails of hay will cost 8 * 3 = $24.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is 6 * 5 = $30. 

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the money Michael has. 
Change = 30 - 24
Change = 6

The final answer is 6."

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost, total revenue, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 
So, the total cost is $576.

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each. 
Total revenue from selling 17 sneakers = 17 * $20 = $340.

The rest of the sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers.
He sold these 31 sneakers for $25 each. 
Total revenue from selling 31 sneakers = 31 * $25 = $775.

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $1115 - $576 = $539.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the cost of the super ticket and the extra popcorn and soda.

The super ticket costs $20 and the extra popcorn and soda cost $1. So, the total cost of the super ticket and the extra popcorn and soda is $20 + $1 = $21.

Since you saved $2, the total cost of the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda is $21 - $2 = $19.

You bought a regular ticket for $12, so the cost of the popcorn and soda is $19 - $12 = $7.

Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn is $7 - $3 = $4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the cost of filling 20 balloons after the price increase.

The cost of filling 20 balloons after the price increase is $900. Since the price of each balloon increased by $20, we need to divide $900 by 20 to find the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase.

$900 รท 20 = $45 per balloon

Now, we can multiply the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase by 170 to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons.

$45 per balloon ร 170 balloons = $7650

The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 150 / 3 = 50 mph.

"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we need to calculate the volume of the raised beds. 

The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised beds) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 

So, the volume of one raised bed is 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, he needs 10 x 32 = 320 cubic feet of potting soil.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so he needs 320 / 2 = 160 bags of potting soil.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 x 12 = $1920.

- 42 bales of hay: 42 x 75 pounds = 3150 pounds
- 20 sacks of oats: 20 x 65 pounds = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we'll divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity:

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he'll need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate how much she earns in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can. She drinks 3 cans a week, so she earns 3 x 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans per week.

Grayson earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She drinks 5 bottles a week, so she earns 5 x 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles per week.

"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought. 

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each. 
20 x 45 cents = 900 cents
Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we can convert 900 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. 
900 cents / 100 = 9 dollars

Becky received a $1 discount, so we subtract 1 dollar from 9 dollars. 
9 - 1 = 8 dollars

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid. 
Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. 
20 x 50 cents = 1000 cents
1000 cents / 100 = 10 dollars

Kelly received a 10 percent discount. 
10 percent of 10 dollars is 10 x 0.1 = 1 dollar

2. His dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra.
3. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.
4. According to the rule, Matt can have 0.5x + 2 cookies.
5. Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, we can set up the equation: 0.5x + 2 = 5
6. To solve for x, we need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 0.5x = 3

"To find out how much Paul spent, we need to calculate the total cost of his morning rides and afternoon rides separately.

Morning rides: 
He drives twice a day for 14 days, so that's 2 x 14 = 28 rides.
Each morning ride costs $6, so the total cost of morning rides is 28 x 6 = $168.

Afternoon rides: 
He drives twice a day for 14 days, so that's 2 x 14 = 28 rides.
Each afternoon ride costs $2, so the total cost of afternoon rides is 28 x 2 = $56.

Total cost = cost of morning rides + cost of afternoon rides
Total cost = $168 + $56
Total cost = $224

The final answer is: 224"
"To find out how many oranges they have, we need to add the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

"To find the cost of the first venue, we need to add the flat fee to the cost of the food. The cost of the food is $5 per person, so if there are x guests, the total cost of the food is 5x. The total cost of the first venue is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per person, so the total cost is 25x.

To find when the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x.

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:
200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:
10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of insects each person found. 

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. 
Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. 
Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects they found together is 43. So, we can write the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:
x + x + 7 = 43

Combine x terms:
2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David and Lily found.

David found x/2 = 18/2 = 9 insects.
Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. 

First, we need to find the total amount of yarn used in one skein. 
1 skein = 364 yards
1/4 skein = 364 / 4 = 91 yards
1/2 skein = 364 / 2 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:
91 + 182 = 273 yards

They used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to add the gifts she bought for her friends and the additional 10 random gifts.

For 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts.
For 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts.
Adding these together, we get 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Then, Cherrie bought 10 more random gifts. So, the total number of gifts is 16 + 10 = 26.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to follow the steps:

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so we need to multiply the width of the rug by 2 and add 2. 
   Twice the width of the rug is 8 x 2 = 16 feet.
   The couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The couch is 18 feet long."
"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to know how much she paid in total for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half of that for a pack of green apple gum. Half of $2 is $1. So, she paid $1 for the green apple gum. 

The total amount she paid for the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3. 

Now, we need to subtract the amount she paid for the grape and green apple gum from the total amount she paid. 

$7 (total amount) - $3 (grape and green apple gum) = $4. 

So, the strawberry gum packs cost $4 each.

"To find out how much Janet would save, we need to first find out how much she spends on bus trips in a week.

She takes 2 bus trips a day, 5 days a week. So, she takes 2 x 5 = 10 bus trips a week.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so she spends 10 x $2.20 = $22 a week.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) = 90 cows
10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 30 sheep

Now, let's add the total number of cows and sheep: 
90 + 30 = 120

The farm and zoo have 120 animals combined."

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potatoes."
"To find out how much calorie deficit Andy needs, we need to calculate the number of days he has to lose 30 pounds.

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. 
From December 31st to July 19th, there are 181 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 3500 * 30 = 105,000 calories to lose 30 pounds.

To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide 105,000 calories by 181 days.

105,000 calories / 181 days = approximately 580 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 580 calories to reach his goal."

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to first find her weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.

The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. So, the new daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. The new weekly consumption will be 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour.

The cost of 1 kilowatt per hour is $1.50. So, the weekly consumption before adding the new device is 84 * $1.50 = $126. The weekly consumption after adding the new device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.

"To find out how much Elvis has to save each day in the second half of the month, we need to first find out how much he saves in the first half of the month.

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, and there are 30 days in April, we can divide 1125 by 30 to find out how much he saves each day in the first half of the month.

1125 รท 15 (half of 30) = 75

So, Elvis saves $75 per day in the first half of the month.

Now, we know that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month. To find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we can multiply the amount he saves in the first half by 2.

He works 5 times a week, so the total distance he walks in a week is 6 x 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the alphabet twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so that's 26 x 2 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, Elise has written a total of 65 letters."
"To find out how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to follow the pattern of the phone tree.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 families are notified.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 families are notified.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 families are notified.

The final answer is: 81"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight. 

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so he lost 10 x 3 = 30 pounds. 

His final weight was 70 pounds. 

Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how many toys Jonathan has, we need to first find out how many toys he needs to make a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

James's play set has 80 toys. A set five times larger than James's would have 5 x 80 = 400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than that, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

Since the shop gives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $20.
10% of $20 is 0.1 x $20 = $2

The final cost after the discount is $20 - $2 = $18

The final answer is 18."
"To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the hamburgers, the cost of the potato fries, and the cost of the fruit drinks.

The cost of the hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of the potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of the fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $10.

The total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill.

$50 - $33 = $17.

Carly gets $17 back as change."
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break it down into two parts: 

1. Commission for the first $1000: 
   30% of $1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = $300

2. Commission for the remaining $1500:
   10% of $1500 = 0.1 * 1500 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together: 
$300 + $150 = $450

So, Antonella earned $450.

Final answer: 450"
"To find out how many bottles Bill needs, we first need to find out how many bottles he already has. 

He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he has 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests. So, he needs 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he needs. 

140 - 48 = 92

So, Bill needs 92 more bottles of water.

92"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles, we multiply 16 by 3. 
16 * 3 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. 
First, we find out how long it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day. 
2 * 16 = 32 minutes
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply 34 by 3 to find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day. 
34 * 3 = 102 minutes

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we subtract 48 from 102. 
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The answer is 54."
"To find out how much John earns in a week, we need to multiply the number of hours he works per week by his hourly wage.

He works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, so he works 5 x 4 = 20 hours a week.

He earns $2 per hour, so he earns 20 x 2 = $40 per week.

To find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we need to divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by the amount he earns per week ($40).

$80 รท $40 = 2

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

2"
"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of the foot-long fish sub: $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub: 3 x $40 = $120

So, the total cost for both subs is $40 + $120 = $160."
"To find the total number of holes, we need to do two things: 

First, we need to find out how many buttons had four holes. 
Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 buttons had two holes, we subtract 7 from 21 to find the number of buttons with four holes. 
21 - 7 = 14 buttons had four holes.

Now, we multiply the number of buttons with four holes by 4 to find the total number of holes in those buttons. 
14 * 4 = 56 holes.

Next, we need to find the total number of holes in the 7 buttons with two holes. 
7 * 2 = 14 holes.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with four holes and the buttons with two holes. 
56 + 14 = 70 holes.

The total number of holes in the bag is 70.

70"
"To find Peter's locker size, we need to know the size of Zack's locker first. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Zack's locker size by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Peter's locker size: 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to know how many cups Octavia drinks. 

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, but we can call it x. So, Octavia drinks x/2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) cups.

Juan's doctor asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. So, we need to find out how many cups Juan drinks now and subtract 4 from it.

Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) cups. We can simplify this to 5x cups.

Now, we need to find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce. To do that, we subtract 4 from 5x. 

5x - 4

We don't know the value of x, but we can say that Juan needs to reduce 4 cups from 5x."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters, so 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters.
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs, so 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Now, let's add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 + 15 = 45.

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight, we need to know the total weight of all three friends. 

Mark weighs 150 pounds. 
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, let's add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180.

The average weight of the three friends is 180."
"To find the angle from the ground to the sun, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees) to the angle the sun moves (5 degrees per hour) multiplied by the number of hours it moves (10 hours).

First, we multiply 5 degrees by 10 hours: 
5 * 10 = 50 degrees

Then, we add the result to the initial angle of the pyramid: 
32 + 50 = 82 degrees

The final answer is 82."
"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to know the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide 20 by 5 to find out how many packs James needs. 

20 รท 5 = 4

So, James needs 4 packs of candles. 

4 packs * $3 per pack = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to know how many minutes she read in total. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we need to divide 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70

So, she read 70 pages in the first week.

In the second week, she read 100 pages.

To find out the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we need to add the pages she read in the first week and the second week.

70 + 100 = 170

The final answer is: 170"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to first calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so he ate 1/3 of 12 sandwiches. 
1/3 of 12 is 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so he ate 1/4 of 12 sandwiches. 
1/4 of 12 is 3 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the sandwiches they ate together: 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

They started with 12 sandwiches, and they ate 7, so we need to subtract 7 from 12 to find out how many sandwiches are left.

12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find Shiloh's age in 7 years and then divide it by 3 to find his nephew's age today.

Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Since in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, we can set up the equation:

51 = 3x

To find the nephew's age, we need to divide both sides by 3:

x = 51 / 3
x = 17

So, Shiloh's nephew is 17 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each. So, that's 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. The previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, so half of that is $0.50 per tooth. For two teeth, that's 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the money: 
$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00."
"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to follow the clues given in the question.

Richie scored 80 goals. 
Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals: 80 - 20 = 60. 
So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can find Anna's goals by subtracting 45 from Richie's goals: 80 - 45 = 35. 
So, Anna scored 35 goals.

Now, we know the number of goals each teenager scored: 
- Richie scored 80 goals
- Mark scored 60 goals
- Anna scored 35 goals

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

21 lemonades * $4 per lemonade = $84

Liam made $63. To find out how much more Mitchell made, we need to subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made.

$84 - $63 = $21

Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures.

Peter spent $5 each on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday. There are 3 days, so he spent 3 x $5 = $15 on wooden action figures.

He has $70 initially and spent $15, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. There are 3 days, so he will spend 3 x $2 = $6.

He has $55 left and spent $6, so he has $55 - $6 = $49 left.

Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he can buy $49 / $2 = 24.5. But you can't buy half of an action figure, so he can buy 24 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 24 wooden action figures and 24 plastic action figures.

24 + 24 = 48

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

Spaying the kitten cost $200.
The 3 vaccines cost $20 each, so 3 x $20 = $60.
The 4 vases cost $12 each, so 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to first find out how many roses he supplies in a month. 

There are 4 weeks in a month. 

Ford supplies 40 roses per week. 
So, in a month, he supplies 40 x 4 = 160 roses.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. 
So, in a month, they order 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Ford supplies 160 roses, but the flower shops order 65 roses. 
So, Ford lacks 160 - 65 = 95 roses."
"To find out how much money Katina will have left after 2 years, we need to calculate how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 2 years will have 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from her account every month. So, in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400 from her account.

To find out how much money will be left, we need to subtract the amount she removed from her initial amount. 

$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost of bread: 1 loaf costs $3.00, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is 1 loaf.
- Cost of cheese and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:
- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to know how many crayons she has. 

She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons. So, she has 3 x 64 = 192 crayons.

Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we need to multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the room first. 

The room is 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is 18 x 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the carpet will cost 216 x $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the padding will cost 216 x $2 = $432.

The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so the removal cost will be 216 x $4 = $864.

The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the installation cost will be 216 x $34 = $7344.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The total cost to replace the carpet is $10512."

"To find the correct temperature, we need to find the percentage that the oven is off. 

First, we find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature: 
468 - 450 = 18

Then, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100 to get the percentage:
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the correct temperature. We do the same thing as before, but this time we multiply the percentage by the set temperature:
4% of 520 = (4/100) * 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set her oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees."
"To find the total time, we need to add the time of both movies. 

First, we need to convert the time of the first movie from hours and minutes to just minutes. 
1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. 
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the second movie, which is 2 hours and 5 minutes. 
2 hours is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. 
120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of both movies:

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to know the number of cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will get, we need to first find out how many pairs he can get from 2 boxes. 

Since 1 box has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes, he will have 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Since each pair of contacts is 2 contacts, we divide 180 by 2 to get 90 pairs.

Now, we need to find out the cost of 2 boxes. Each box is $100 and it's 10% off. So, the discount is 10% of $100, which is 0.1 * $100 = $10. 

The cost of 1 box is $100 - $10 = $90. Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is $90 * 2 = $180.

Now, we need to find out the cost of each pair of contacts. We know that Pete has 90 pairs of contacts and the total cost is $180. 

To find the cost of each pair, we divide $180 by 90 pairs. $180 / 90 = $2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their total earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. 
So, Jill's total hours = 2 + 1 = 3 hours
Jill earns $10 per hour, so Jill's total earnings = 3 * 10 = $30

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so John worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so John worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours = 4 + 3 = 7 hours
John earns $10 per hour, so John's total earnings = 7 * 10 = $70

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we need to subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings.
$70 - $30 = $40

The answer is 40."
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. 
So, 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour.
So, 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories. 
So, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.
1600 calories / 200 calories = 8.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. 

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since it's 1% fewer).

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

Red jelly beans = 0.99B
= 0.99 * 1500
= 1485

Now, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

Green jelly beans = 1.01B
= 1.01 * 1500
= 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1509 - 1485 = 24

The answer is 24."

"To find out how many seats Alex needs, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event.

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them invited 2 friends. So, the number of people invited by Alex's friends is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invited 10 of her friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. So, the number of people brought by Alex's friends is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the people invited by Alex and her friends: 100 (Alex) + 200 (her friends) + 18 (her friends' spouses) = 318.

So, Alex needs 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to find the weight of the Papillon first. 

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 x 10 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 x 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost on both Amazon and eBay.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 x $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times the beanstalk needs to double to be taller than Mark's window.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 x 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 x 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 x 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet (Mark's window height), the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

He eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, and each cup has 3 grams of protein. 

200 grams of mushrooms / 100 grams per cup = 2 cups of mushrooms per day

2 cups of mushrooms per day * 3 grams of protein per cup = 6 grams of protein per day

There are 7 days in a week. 

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, let's say Jerry's current age is x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each. Since George needs 2 implants, the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we need to divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$3900 รท $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's call the smallest angle ""x"". 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, that angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, that angle is 3x.

We know that the three angles add up to 180 degrees. So, we can write an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

He has 8 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 8 quarters are worth 8 x 25 = 200 cents.

He has 6 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 6 dimes are worth 6 x 10 = 60 cents.

He has 14 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents. So, 14 nickels are worth 14 x 5 = 70 cents.

He has 15 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 cent. So, 15 pennies are worth 15 x 1 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 รท 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"Let's break it down step by step:

Year 1:
- He gets 5 games for his birthday.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so that's 12 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so he has 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games.

Year 2:
- He already has 22 games from the previous year.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so that's 24 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so he has 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games.

Year 3:
- He already has 51 games from the previous year.
- He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so that's 48 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so he has 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games.

"To find the answer, we need to first find the speed of the plane. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it takes to travel 2000 miles at this speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

The plane already traveled for 3 hours, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Additional time = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional time = 2 hours

To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we need to multiply Ruiz's amount by 3/4. 
3/4 * 120 = 90 pounds. 
So, Marissa makes 90 pounds of chocolates in an hour. 
Now, we need to find out how many pounds Marissa makes in 12 hours. 
90 * 12 = 1080 pounds. 
Ruiz makes 120 * 6 = 720 pounds in 12 hours.

15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
60 cups * $0.50 per cup = $30

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
20 cups * $0.60 per cup = $12

Now, let's add the money he earned in both periods.
$30 + $12 = $42

Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Now, we need to find out how many times the tire will rotate in a year. We know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. 

So, we divide the total miles driven in a year by 2 and multiply by 725.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year
2400 rotations/year * 725 rotations/rotation = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tire to rotate 10,440,000 times. 

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

"To find out how much Joe will have left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items he's buying.

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. So, the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to find 30% of $60. To do this, we multiply $60 by 0.3 (which is 30% in decimal form). 

$60 * 0.3 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost. 

$60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the discounted price. The sales tax is usually 8% of the discounted price. 

$42 * 0.08 = $3.36

Now, we add the sales tax to the discounted price. 

$42 + $3.36 = $45.36

Joe started with $50. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total cost from the amount he started with.

$50 - $45.36 = $4.64

"To find the price of the gold jewel, we need to multiply the price of the diamond by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * 2000
Price of gold jewel = 1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. So, the price of the silver jewel is:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond, gold, and silver. To find the total price, we add them together:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to first find out how much he can spend in total. 

Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the total cost is more than $10 per class. Since there are 10 classes, the total cost should be less than or equal to $100. 

Manny already paid $60 for the classes. So, the remaining amount he can spend is $100 - $60 = $40.

Now, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the total cost exceeds $100. 

Let's say Manny misses x classes. The total cost will be $60 + $10x. We want this to be less than or equal to $100.

$60 + $10x โค $100

Subtract $60 from both sides:
$10x โค $40

Divide both sides by $10:
x โค 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find out how many customers Jewel processes in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. There are 7 days in a week. 
50 customers/day * 7 days = 350 customers per week.

Since Julie processes twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total number of customers processed by Julie in a week is 100 customers/day * 7 days = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two is 350 customers (Jewel) + 700 customers (Julie) = 1050 customers.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately.

First, let's find the cost of 5 apples. 
Since 4 apples cost $5.20, we can divide $5.20 by 4 to find the cost of 1 apple. 
$5.20 รท 4 = $1.30 per apple.

Now, let's find the cost of 5 apples. 
$1.30 per apple ร 5 apples = $6.50

Next, let's find the cost of 5 oranges. 
Since 3 oranges cost $3.30, we can divide $3.30 by 3 to find the cost of 1 orange. 
$3.30 รท 3 = $1.10 per orange.

Now, let's find the cost of 5 oranges. 
$1.10 per orange ร 5 oranges = $5.50

Now, let's add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together. 
$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

The answer is 216."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount, so the price per pomegranate was 30 * 0.9 = $27. The total cost was 20 * 27 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is 540 - 360 = $180."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of green hats. 

Let's say the sales of green hats in the first month is x. 
Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, 
the sales of red hats is x/2. 
We know that the total sales of red hats is $400, so x/2 = 400. 
Solving for x, we get x = 800. 

So, the sales of green hats in the first month is $800. 
The total sales in the first month is 800 + 400 = $1200. 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 * 1200 = $900. 
The total sales in two months is 1200 + 900 = $2100.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs and heads for each animal. 

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head. 
Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's say the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'. 

We know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so s + g = 20.

We also know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so 4s + 2g = 70.

We can solve these two equations to find the number of sheep. 

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40.

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation: 
(4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to 2s = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of adding 20cm and then dividing by 1.5 (since 50% is the same as 1/2, and 1/2 * 2 = 1, so we divide by 1.5).

Let's call the original length of the dress 'x'. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, and we know that this is 1.5 times the original length plus 20cm. 

So, we can write the equation: 
1.5x + 20 = 140

Now, we need to solve for x. 

First, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: 
1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5: 
x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time, we need to add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add half of each time.

Total time = (60 minutes / 2) + (40 minutes / 2)
Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 50 minutes

The answer is 50."
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school, we need to subtract the time they've already spent from the total time they have.

They have 30 minutes. They spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

6 + 13 = 19 minutes

30 - 19 = 11 minutes

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"To find the total amount Catherine paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

Catherine paid $14 in total."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies. 

In total, they baked 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. 

They eat 10 cookies, so they put 90 - 10 = 80 cookies in the box.

The answer is: 80"
"Let's break it down. 

Let's say the age of the younger triplet is x. 
Since there is one twin who is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the twin is x + 7.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. 
So, we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms: 
3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides: 
3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 7.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we can round down to 7. 

So, the younger triplet is 7 years old. 

The twin who is 7 years older than the triplet is 7 + 7 = 14 years old.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to add up the time he has for homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert 3 hours into minutes. 
3 hours = 3 * 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, let's add up the time for homework:
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, let's subtract the time for homework from the total time before dinner:
180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10. 
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know that 4 candies cost $3.20. To find the cost of one candy, we divide $3.20 by 4. 
$3.20 / 4 = $0.80

Now, we multiply the cost of one candy by 10. 
10 candies * $0.80 = $8.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"Rong saves 20 coins every month. 
Neil saves 2/5 more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month.

There are 12 months in a year, so in one year, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins and Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

In ten years, Rong will save 240 * 10 = 2400 coins and Neil will save 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after ten years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

5760"
"To find out how much John leaves with, we need to first calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.

The cost of 2 vaccines is 2 x $20 = $40.
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to find 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 60% of x is 0.6x. We know that the total bill is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check, so we can write the equation: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to subtract 0.6x from both sides of the equation: 0.4x = $40. Then, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find the cost of the heartworm check: 0.6x = 0.6 x $100 = $60.

The total cost is $40 (vaccines) + $60 (heartworm check) = $100.

John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25."
"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of each fruit and then add them together.

One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so one banana costs 2 * 0.5 = $1.
One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs 3 * 1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * 1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * 0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * 3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is 5 + 6 + 21 = $32.

The final answer is 32."

"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to find out how many regular chairs she has. 

Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5. 

8 * 5 = 40

So, Mia has 40 regular chairs. 

Now, we need to add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs. 

8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Since there are 42 adults and 15 babies, we need to add them together. 

42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

Mia needs 57 chairs in total. She already has 48 chairs, so she needs to get 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we need to first find the number of bucks. 

There are 50 deer, and 50 percent of them are bucks. 
50 percent of 50 is 0.5 * 50 = 25. 
So, there are 25 bucks.

Now, 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. 
20 percent of 25 is 0.2 * 25 = 5. 
So, there are 5 8 point bucks."
"To find out how many points the class has, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 x 50 = 15. 
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 x 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all the students: 
Adam + Betty + Tom + Marta = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip. 
So, they are missing 400 - 255 = 145 points."

16 (total pencils) / 2 = 8 pairs

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city and in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city. There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks is:
15 * 20 = 300

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300:
40% of 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She has 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks is:
3 * 5 = 15

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see in the city and the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard:

"To find out how many people are going to the cinema, we need to add Aiden and his 12 friends to the 7 more friends they meet up with. 

Aiden + 12 friends + 7 more friends = 20 people

Each seat can hold 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks. So, for 20 people, we need:

- 20 people * 1 person per seat = 20 seats
- 20 people * 2 drinks per seat = 40 drinks
- 20 people * 3 snacks per seat = 60 snacks

Since drinks and snacks cost $2 each, we need to multiply the number of drinks and snacks by 2.

- 40 drinks * $2 per drink = $80
- 60 snacks * $2 per snack = $120

To find the total amount of money spent, we add the cost of drinks and snacks.

$80 + $120 = $200

The group spent $200 on snacks and drinks."
"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The total amount of gravel the three trucks can carry together is 11,600 pounds.
4. To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the amount of gravel Gissela and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total amount. 
   So, 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to first find out how many dumplings the males ate. 

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings the males ate is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings the females ate is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten is 32 (males) + 18 (females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."

Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many hours they need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount they already raised ($2100) from their goal ($6300).

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, we need to find out how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal.

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, they need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the answer, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 40% of the water is used by the city. Then, 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. 

To find 80% of 40%, we multiply 40% by 0.8 (since 80% is the same as 0.8). 

40% * 0.8 = 0.4

Now, we need to find what percentage 0.4 is of the total 40%. To do that, we divide 0.4 by 40% (or 0.4) and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

(0.4 / 0.4) * 100 = 100%

So, 100% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes. That means 0% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. 

There were 5 people, and each pizza had 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, that's 3 people. 2/3 of 12 slices is 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices. So, 3 people ate 8 slices. 

The total number of slices eaten by 3 people is 8. Now, we need to subtract this from the total number of slices. 60 - 8 = 52 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ยพ of their pizzas. ยพ of 12 slices is ยพ x 12 = 9 slices. 

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by the two remaining friends from the remaining slices. 52 - 9 = 43 slices.

So, there are 43 slices of pizza left."
"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of 30 minutes. 

2/3 of 30 minutes is 20 minutes. 

Now, we have the time the cat takes (30 minutes) and the time the dog takes (20 minutes). 

To find the average time, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, then divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 8 feet is equal to 8 x 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe 'x'. 

So, we can write the equation: 
9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Now, divide both sides by 9:
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

"To find the number of people who voted by 16:00, we need to find out how many people voted by midday and then add the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.

First, let's find out how many people voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 people voted by midday. 

2/5 * 5000 = 2000

So, 2000 people voted by midday.

Now, let's find out how many people were left. 

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Now, 2/3 of the remaining people voted between midday and 16:00. 

2/3 * 3000 = 2000

So, 2000 people voted between midday and 16:00.

Now, let's find out how many people voted by 16:00. 

2000 (voted by midday) + 2000 (voted between midday and 16:00) = 4000

Now, let's find out how many people did not vote by 16:00.

"To find out how many smores the kids want, we multiply the number of kids by 2. 
9 kids * 2 smores = 18 smores

To find out how many smores the adults want, we multiply the number of adults by 1. 
6 adults * 1 smore = 6 smores

Now, we add the smores the kids and adults want. 
18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by 8. 
24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers."
"To find the ages of Dora's parents, we need to follow the given information:

1. Dora is 15 years old.
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
   So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years old.
3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
Dora's age + father's age + mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"To find out how many votes candidate B got, we need to calculate 50% of candidate A's votes. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, so 50% of the votes is 2 x 20% = 40%. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A, so candidate B got 20% + 40% = 60% of the votes.

Now, we know that candidate A got 20% and candidate B got 60% of the votes. The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. 

100% - 20% - 60% = 20%. 

So, candidate C got 20% of the votes. 

To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to calculate 20% of 100. 

20% of 100 is 0.2 x 100 = 20.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we need to first find the total number of students in each class. 

Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes, we divide 80 by 2 to get 40 students in each class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the same as 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16

So, there are 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
She trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

Now she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 large stickers.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
She trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now she has 3 small stickers left and 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers.

She has 3 small stickers and 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she can trade 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Since he drives back home, the time it takes to drive back is the same, which is 2 hours.

Now, we add the time spent at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Time to drive to the museum + Time to drive back + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 2 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need, we need to calculate the total number of wheels for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total wheels needed: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

There will be 276 wheels left."
"To find the discount, I need to calculate 20% of $1000. 

20% of $1000 is 0.20 x $1000 = $200.

Now, I need to subtract the discount from the original price. 

$1000 - $200 = $800.

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the cost, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Mike has 600 movies. A third of them are in series. 
   A third of 600 is 600 / 3 = 200 movies.

2. So, 200 movies are in series. The cost of these series is 200 * $6 = $1200.

3. The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies.

4. 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies. 
   40% of 400 is 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies.

5. The cost of these older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

6. The cost of the remaining movies is 400 - 160 = 240 movies. 
   The cost of these movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

7. The total cost is $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400.

The final answer is: $4400"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

Peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
Plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed of the family when they hiked. 

The family drove at 50 miles per hour. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25. 25 - 5 is 20. So, they hiked at 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time. Distance = speed * time. Distance = 20 * 1.5. Distance = 30 miles.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate their individual scores first.

Let's say Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 + Ava's berries. Since Ava collects 5 points for each berry, Emma collects 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) points.

Emma jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so Emma jumps on Ava's enemies - 8. Since Emma jumps on 10 points for each enemy, Emma gets 10 * (Ava's enemies - 8) points.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Ava, so Emma gets 30 * 4 = 120 points less than Ava.

Now, we can write the equation for Emma's score:
E = 10 * (Ava's enemies - 8) + 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) - 120

We also know that Ava's score is 10 * Ava's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * (Ava's time - 4).

Since we don't know Ava's berries and enemies, let's simplify the equation for Emma's score:
E = 10 * (Ava's enemies - 8) + 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) - 120
E = 10A - 80 + 15 + 5A - 120
E = 15A - 185

Now, we can write the equation for Ava's score:
A = 10A + 5A + 30 * (Ava's time - 4)
A = 15A + 30 * (Ava's time - 4)

Since we don't know Ava's time, let's simplify the equation for Ava's score:
A = 15A + 30A - 120
A = 45A - 120

Now we have two equations:
E = 15A - 185
A = 45A - 120

We can solve for A by subtracting 15A from both sides of the second equation:
A - 15A = 45A - 120 - 15A
-14A = -120
A = 120 / 14
A = 8.57

Now that we know Ava's score, we can find Emma's score:
E = 15A - 185
E = 15 * 8.57 - 185
E = 128.05 - 185
E = -56.95

Since you can't have a negative score, we need to recheck our calculations. Let's recheck the calculations for Ava's score:
A = 45A - 120
A - 45A = -120
-44A = -120
A = 120 / 44
A = 2.73

Now that we know Ava's score, we can find Emma's score:
E = 15A - 185
E = 15 * 2.73 - 185
E = 40.95 - 185
E = -144.05

Since you can't have a negative score, we need to recheck our calculations again. Let's recheck the calculations for Emma's score:
E = 15A - 185
E = 15 * (Ava's enemies - 8) + 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) - 120

We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava jumps on 8 + Emma's enemies enemies. Since Emma jumps on 10 points for each enemy, Ava gets 10 * (8 + Emma's enemies) points.

We also know that Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 + Ava's berries berries. Since Ava collects 5 points for each berry, Emma gets 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) points.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Ava, so Emma gets 30 * 4 = 120 points less than Ava.

Now, we can write the equation for Emma's score:
E = 10 * (8 + Emma's enemies) + 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) - 120

We also know that Ava's score is 10 * Ava's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * (Ava's time - 4).

Since we don't know Ava's berries and enemies, let's simplify the equation for Emma's score:
E = 10 * (8 + Emma's enemies) + 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) - 120
E = 80 + 10 * Emma's enemies + 15 + 5 * Ava's berries - 120
E = 10 * Emma's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries - 25

Now, we can write the equation for Ava's score:
A = 10 * Ava's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * (Ava's time - 4)

Since we don't know Ava's time, let's simplify the equation for Ava's score:
A = 10 * Ava's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 120

Now we have two equations:
E = 10 * Emma's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries - 25
A = 10 * Ava's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 120

We can solve for A by subtracting 5 * Ava's berries from both sides of the first equation:
E - 5 * Ava's berries = 10 * Emma's enemies - 25
5 * Ava's berries = 10 * Emma's enemies - 25 + 5 * Ava's berries
5 * Ava's berries - 5 * Ava's berries = 10 * Emma's enemies - 25
0 = 10 * Emma's enemies - 25
10 * Emma's enemies = 25
Emma's enemies = 25 / 10
Emma's enemies = 2.5

Now that we know Emma's enemies, we can find Ava's enemies:
Ava's enemies = Emma's enemies + 8
Ava's enemies = 2.5 + 8
Ava's enemies = 10.5

We also know that Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 + Ava's berries berries. Since Ava collects 5 points for each berry, Emma gets 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) points.

Now, we can find Ava's berries:
5 * Ava's berries = 5 * (Ava's berries + 3)
5 * Ava's berries = 5 * Ava's berries + 15
5 * Ava's berries - 5 * Ava's berries = 15
0 = 15
This is not possible, so we need to recheck our calculations.

Let's recheck the calculations for Emma's enemies:
E = 10 * Emma's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries - 25
E = 10 * 2.5 + 5 * Ava's berries - 25
E = 25 + 5 * Ava's berries - 25
E = 5 * Ava's berries

Now, we can find Ava's berries:
5 * Ava's berries = E + 25
5 * Ava's berries = 5
Ava's berries = 1

We also know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava jumps on 8 + Emma's enemies enemies. Since Emma jumps on 10 points for each enemy, Ava gets 10 * (8 + Emma's enemies) points.

Now, we can find Ava's enemies:
10 * (8 + Emma's enemies) = A
10 * (8 + 2.5) = A
10 * 10.5 = A
A = 105

Now that we know Ava's enemies, we can find Ava's score:
A = 10 * Ava's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * (Ava's time - 4)
A = 10 * 105 + 5 * 1 + 30 * (Ava's time - 4)
A = 1050 + 5 + 30 * Ava's time - 120
A = 935 + 30 * Ava's time

We also know that Emma's score is 5 * Ava's berries - 25:
E = 5 * Ava's berries - 25
E = 5 * 1 - 25
E = -20

Now that we know Ava's time, we can find Ava's score:
A = 935 + 30 * Ava's time
A = 935 + 30 * (Ava's time - 4 + 4)
A = 935 + 30 * Ava's time - 120 + 120
A = 935 + 30 * Ava's time

Now we have two equations:
E = 5 * Ava's berries - 25
A = 935 + 30 * Ava's time

We can solve for A by substituting 5 * Ava's berries into the first equation:
E = 5 * Ava's berries - 25
E = 5 * 1 - 25
E = -20

Now that we know E, we can find Ava's time:
A = 935 + 30 * Ava's time
-20 = 935 + 30 * Ava's time
-20 - 935 = 30 * Ava's time
-955 = 30 * Ava's time
Ava's time = -955 / 30
Ava's time = -31.83

Since you can't have a negative time, we need to recheck our calculations.

Let's recheck the calculations for Ava's berries:
E = 5 * Ava's berries - 25
E = 5 * Ava's berries - 25
E = 5 * (3 + Ava's berries) - 25
5 * (3 + Ava's berries) = E + 25
5 * 3 + 5 * Ava's berries = E + 25
15 + 5 * Ava's berries = E + 25
5 * Ava's berries = E + 10
Ava's berries = (E + 10) / 5

Now, we can find Ava's berries:
Ava's berries = (E + 10) / 5
Ava's berries = (-20 + 10) / 5
Ava's berries = -10 / 5
Ava's berries = -2

Since you can't have a negative number of berries, we need to recheck our calculations.

Let's recheck the calculations for Emma's enemies:
E = 10 * Emma's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries - 25
E = 10 * Emma's enemies + 5 * (-2) - 25
E = 10 * Emma's enemies - 10 - 25
E = 10 * Emma's enemies - 35

Now, we can find Emma's enemies:
10 * Emma's enemies - 35 = E
10 * Emma's enemies = E + 35
Emma's enemies = (E + 35) / 10

Now, we can find Ava's enemies:
Ava's enemies = Emma's enemies + 8
Ava's enemies = (E + 35) / 10 + 8
Ava's enemies = (E + 35 + 80) / 10
Ava's enemies = (E + 115) / 10

Now we have two equations:
E = 10 * Emma's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries - 25
A = 10 * Ava's enemies + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 120

We can solve for A by substituting (E + 115) / 10 for Ava's enemies:
A = 10 * ((E + 115) / 10) + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 120
A = E + 115 + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 120
A = E + 115 + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 120
A = E + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 5

Now, we can substitute (E + 35) / 10 for Emma's enemies:
A = (E + 35) / 10 + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 5
A = E + 35 / 10 + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 5
A = E + 3.5 + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 5
A = E + 5 * Ava's berries + 30 * Ava's time - 1.5

Now, we can substitute (E + 10) / 5 for Ava's berries:
A = E + 5 * (E + 10) / 5 + 30 * Ava's time - 1.5
A = E + E + 10 + 30 * Ava's time - 1.5
A = 2E + 10 + 30 * Ava's time - 1.5
A = 2E + 8.5 + 30 * Ava's time

Now, we can substitute (E + 35) / 10 for Emma's enemies:
A = 2E + 8.5 + 30 * ((E + 35) / 10) - 1.5
A = 2E + 8.5 + 3E + 105 - 1.5
A = 5E + 112

Now, we can substitute (E + 10) / 5 for Ava's berries:
A = 5E + 112
A = 5E + 112

Now we have two equations:
E = 5E + 112
5E + 112 = E

Now, we can solve for E:
5E - E = 112
4E = 112
E = 112 / 4
E = 28

Now that we know E, we can find Ava's score:
A = 5E + 112
A = 5 * 28 + 112
A = 140 + 112
A = 252

Now that we know both scores, we can find the difference between their scores:
Difference = A - E
Difference = 252 - 28
Difference = 224

The final answer is: 224"
"To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

64 - 30 = 34

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by 2, since the other two pizzas cost the same amount.

34 รท 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. 
3 * 5 = 15

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. 
They ride 2 * 3 = 6 times on those two days.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week. 
15 + 6 = 21

So, they ride their bikes 21 times a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

When the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish became 3 - 17 = -14 (this is not possible, so we will ignore this number). 

However, we can say that the number of white fish became 4 - 17 = -13 (this is also not possible, so we will ignore this number).

Let's try to find the correct number of white fish taken out. 

Let's say the number of white fish taken out is x. Then, the number of orange fish taken out is 17 - x.

Now, Bob has 3 - (17 - x) orange fish and 4 - x white fish. 

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - (17 - x) = 2(4 - x)

Simplifying the equation:

3 - 17 + x = 8 - 2x

Combine like terms:

-14 + x = 8 - 2x

Add 2x to both sides:

-14 + 3x = 8

Add 14 to both sides:

3x = 22

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 22/3

x is not a whole number, but we can round it to the nearest whole number. However, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we will round it to the nearest whole number. 

x = 7.33 (round down to 7, since you can't buy a fraction of a fish)

So, Bob bought 7 white fish at the store.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his car's fuel efficiency.

Since Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day.

In a week, Andy travels 5 days * 10 miles per day = 50 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas he uses in a week. We know his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so we divide the total distance by the fuel efficiency:

50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Now, we need to find out how much money he spends on gas per week. The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so we multiply the gallons used by the price per gallon:

5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount of money she spent.

Carrie was given 10 twenties. She spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is 6. So, she spent 6 twenties.

She also spent all the quarters, which is 140 quarters. Since 1 twenty is 4 quarters, 140 quarters is 140 / 4 = 35 twenties.

Now, let's add the amount of twenties she spent (6) and the amount of twenties she didn't spend (10 - 6 = 4). 
4 twenties is 4 * 20 = 80.

So, Carrie spent 6 twenties and 35 twenties. 
6 + 35 = 41 twenties.

Now, let's convert the twenties to dollars. 41 twenties is 41 * 20 = 820 dollars.

The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is 820 dollars."
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to multiply the number of plants by the number of fruits each plant yields.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes
Eggplants: 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants

Total fruits: 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

The final answer is: 142"
"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we need to first find out how many TVs are not OLED TVs. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, so that's 1/4 * 40 = 10 smart TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, so that's 1/8 * 40 = 5 analog TVs.

Now, we add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs together: 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since there are 40 TVs in total, we subtract the number of non-OLED TVs from the total: 40 - 15 = 25.

So, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs. 

25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first find out how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost, we need to divide the total cost by 2.

$150 - $50 = $100

John is missing $100."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the difference in temperature between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's 12 degrees colder at night, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, he needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs to heat the house up to the desired temperature."
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group had.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The answer is 12."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

The train started with 172 people. 
At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172: 172 - 47 = 125.
Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125: 125 + 13 = 138.
At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138: 138 - 38 = 100.

There are 100 people on the train now.

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day. 
There are 30 days in the month. 
Each bottle cap is worth $.25.

First, multiply the number of bottle caps by the number of days: 
10 * 30 = 300

Then multiply the result by the value of each bottle cap: 
300 * .25 = 75

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her regular pay first. 

She earns $20 per hour and worked 8 hours, so her regular pay is 20 * 8 = $160.

Then, she worked 3 additional hours at a special rate of 150% of her regular rate. 150% of $20 is 1.5 * 20 = $30. So, for the additional 3 hours, she earned 3 * 30 = $90.

Now, we add her regular pay and the pay for the additional hours: 160 + 90 = $250.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to first find the discount on the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40. The jeans are 25% off, so we need to find 25% of $40.

25% of $40 is 0.25 x $40 = $10.

So, the discount is $10. Now, we need to subtract the discount from the original price.

$40 - $10 = $30

Now, Mike will pay $30 for the jeans. He pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we need to subtract the price of the jeans from the $50 bill.

$50 - $30 = $20

So, Mike will have $20 left over."

"To find the total time they will be caroling, we need to add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so it will take 2 x 150 = 300 seconds to sing it twice.

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, so it will take 1 x 240 = 240 seconds to sing it once.

Now, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

They will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. 
After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 
After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much Billy earns in 20 hours: 
$11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 
Sally's wage after 20 hours is $10.50 * 20 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: 
$230 - $210 = $20.

"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels.

3 loaves of bread cost 3 x $2 = $6
2 bagels cost 2 x $1 = $2

Now, let's subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
$6 - $2 = $4

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to first find half of Pierson's score. 

Pierson scored 278 points. Half of that is 278 / 2 = 139 points.

Nikita scored 11 more than that, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

Now, we need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score to find the total. 

278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428 points.

The total points they scored is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the children and the number of trees planted by the teachers.

Number of children: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of trees planted by children: 1000 students * 1 tree per student = 1000 trees

Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers
Number of trees planted by teachers: 120 teachers * 2 trees per teacher = 240 trees

Total number of trees planted: 1000 trees (children) + 240 trees (teachers) = 1240 trees

The total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240."
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to first find out how many stuffed animals she already has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. 
30% of 14 is 0.3 x 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 
So, Bubbles should buy 4 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 30 minutes (half an hour) every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 2 weeks, that's 2 x 7 = 14 days. 
14 days x 30 minutes = 420 minutes. 
420 minutes / 60 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 7 days. 
7 days x 2 hours = 14 hours.

Kris played a total of 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. 
30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The answer is 9."
"To find out how far apart the two cars will be after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 60 x 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 70 x 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance the first car traveled from the distance the second car traveled to find the distance between them. 

140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600.
The cost of the gold is $300.
The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.
$900 x 0.3 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost.
$900 + $270 = $1170.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to first find the number of students who passed in each grade.

Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed, which is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.

Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed, which is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.

Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, it is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.

Now, we need to find the total number of students who passed in all three grades. 
Third-graders: 340
Fourth-graders: 40
Fifth-graders: 2 * 0.8 * 400 = 640

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 640 = 1020

Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate: 
(1020 / 1000) * 100 = 102%

The overall pass rate is 102%."
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with two bags of glass chips.

Since one bag holds 72 chips and it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide 72 by 12 to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag.

72 รท 12 = 6 square inches

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches he can make with one bag by 2.

6 square inches * 2 = 12 square inches

Now, we know that Milo can make 12 square inches of mosaic with two bags of glass chips. Since he wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it will be.

To do this, we divide the total square inches by the height of the mosaic.

12 square inches รท 3 inches = 4 inches

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to first find out how many quarts of tea were left.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts of tea were drunk by the students.

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so 16 x 2 = 32 quarts of tea were drunk by the students.

In total, 6 + 32 = 38 quarts of tea were drunk.

There were 10 quarts of tea left, so the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). 

48 รท 4 = 12 gallons.

The answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first find out how many candies he has now.

Dale started with 100 candies and sold 150, so he has 100 - 150 = -50 candies. This means he has 50 candies left.

Then, he ordered 100 more candies, so now he has 50 + 100 = 150 candies.

Since he wants to sell all of his candies, we need to find out how many he needs to sell. He has 150 candies and wants to sell all of them, so he needs to sell 150 - 150 = 0 candies.

The final answer is 0."
"To find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the end of January, the number of students is 10 * 2 = 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students is 20 * 2 = 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students is 40 * 2 = 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students is 80 * 2 = 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students is 160 * 2 = 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the number of additional students, we subtract 10 from 320.

320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find out how many branches he climbed in total. 

Felix made $105 in a week. There are 7 days in a week. 

Divide the total amount of money Felix made ($105) by the number of days in a week (7) to find the amount of money he made per day: 
$105 รท 7 = $15 per day

Now, we need to find out how many branches he climbed per day. Each branch costs $0.25. 

Divide the amount of money Felix made per day ($15) by the cost of each branch ($0.25) to find the number of branches he climbed per day:
$15 รท $0.25 = 60 branches per day

"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
3 flowers * 5 petals = 15 petals

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
4 flowers * 6 petals = 24 petals

Then, let's calculate the total number of petals for the 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
5 flowers * 4 petals = 20 petals

Lastly, let's calculate the total number of petals for the 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
6 flowers * 7 petals = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower:
15 petals + 24 petals + 20 petals + 42 petals = 101 petals

However, Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, so we need to subtract 1 from the total number of petals for each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: 15 - 1 = 14 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: 24 - 1 = 23 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: 20 - 1 = 19 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: 42 - 1 = 41 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower after subtracting the dropped flowers:
14 petals + 23 petals + 19 petals + 41 petals = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows. 

First, let's find out how many marshmallows were used. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows dropped (3) from the total number of marshmallows (35). 

35 - 3 = 32

So, there are 32 marshmallows left. 

Now, let's divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have. 

32 รท 2 = 16

So, each kid can have 16 S'mores."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. To find out how many quarters he uses in 4 hours, we need to convert 4 hours to minutes. 4 hours is equal to 240 minutes.

2. Jack plays for 240 minutes, so he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

3. One of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. In 240 minutes, they play for 240 / 10 = 24 times.

4. The other friend is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack. So, they play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes. In 240 minutes, they play for 240 / 30 = 8 times.

5. Now, let's add up the total number of quarters used by all three friends. Jack uses 12 quarters, the first friend uses 24 quarters, and the second friend uses 8 quarters. So, the total number of quarters used is 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 quarters.

6. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total amount of money used is 44 * 25 cents = 1100 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 1100 cents is equal to 1100 / 100 = 11 dollars.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Tanya makes a 10-ounce jar.
- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say the amount of zest is x. Then, the amount of salt is also x. Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, the amount of oil is 2x.

The total amount of ingredients should add up to 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation:

x (zest) + x (salt) + 2x (oil) + x (sugar) + x (fragrance) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x = 10

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 2.5

Now that we know the amount of zest, we can find the amount of oil:
Oil = 2x = 2 * 2.5 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cows: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

John spent $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs, we need to add the number of chocolate and toffee cupcakes he already has. 

8 (chocolate cupcakes) + 40 (toffee cupcakes) = 48 cupcakes

Since Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes needed.

63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes he already has) = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 x 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 8 cars. Then, he gives away 16 cars to his mother. So, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount raised. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Now, we need to divide the amount from students by the number of students. 

$125,000 รท 20 students = $6,250 per student.

The answer is 6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked for half of 8 hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we need to convert the hours into minutes. 
1 hour = 60 minutes
8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days: 
480 + 240 = 720 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we add the initial number of cars to the number of cars that arrived during the first break: 
   50 (initial cars) + 20 (cars that arrived during the first break) = 70 cars

2. Then, we find out how many cars left the parking lot during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the total number of cars left, we calculate 1/2 of 70:
   1/2 * 70 = 35 cars

3. Now, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars:
   70 (total cars) - 35 (cars that left) = 35 cars

So, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to do a few things:

1. First, we need to find out how much he makes in a day. 
   He does 30 cycles a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. 
   So, he does 30 x 5 = 150 tasks a day. 
   Each task pays $1.20, so he makes 150 x $1.20 = $180 a day.

2. Now, we need to find out how much he makes in a week. 
   He works 7 days a week, so we multiply his daily earnings by 7.

2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Julie scored 10 points in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many tins of cat food and dog food Kimberly bought, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of tins in each package.

Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins = 88 tins
Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins = 36 tins

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins.

88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say PJ has x cards.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
3. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.
4. The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341
5. Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341
6. Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
7. Divide both sides by 7: x = 47
8. Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Becca's cards: 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Becca has 153 cards.

153"
"To find out how many eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color.

She had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the refund she will get.

First, let's calculate the cost of shipping:
4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Now, let's calculate the refund:
Original price = $32
Refund = 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24

Since Milly has to pay for the shipping, we need to subtract the shipping cost from the refund:
Refund - shipping cost = $24 - $3.00 = $21

Milly will lose $32 - $21 = $11.

11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to do some math.

Mulan starts with $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60. Now she has $140 - $60 = $80.

Then she buys a bag for $20, so now she has $80 - $20 = $60.

The answer is 60."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to know how much he produced in the first three weeks.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the chocolate produced in the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we need to subtract the chocolate produced in the first three weeks from the total: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the total time she spends on TikTok each week and then multiply it by 4.

She records 18 videos per week, so that's 18 * 4 = 72 videos per month.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes per week.

She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week.

Total time spent on TikTok per week is 72 (videos) + 120 (writing songs) + 90 (doing makeup) = 282 minutes per week.

Now, let's multiply the total time per week by 4 to get the total time per month: 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1128 / 60 = 18.8 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain. 

Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Now, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can. Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12. So, Naruto can lift 480 / 12 = 40 feet."
"To find the total distance Mason traveled, we need to add the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroo. 

Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can divide 18 hours by 3 to find the time it would take for 1 kangaroo to travel across the highway. 

18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours for 1 kangaroo

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of a turtle is 1/2 of the speed of a kangaroo. 

Since 1 kangaroo takes 6 hours to travel across the highway, a turtle will take twice as long because it's traveling at half the speed. 

So, 1 turtle will take 6 hours * 2 = 12 hours to travel across the highway.

Now, we have 4 turtles, so we multiply the time it takes for 1 turtle by 4. 

4 turtles * 12 hours = 48 hours

The final answer is: 48"

Now, let's add up the number of dishes each person made: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The answer is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one. 
The original price of the laptop is $600. 
The price will be reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse. Let's call that amount x.

She also got $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. So, the total amount she has is x + $150 + $80 = x + $230.

We know that she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has is equal to the price of the laptop minus $50. 
x + $230 = $400 - $50
x + $230 = $350

Now, let's solve for x. 
x = $350 - $230
x = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of the glue sticks that are used and subtract it from the total length of the glue sticks.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, let's find the length of the glue sticks that are used:
- The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
- The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
- The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 millimeters.

Now, let's subtract the length of the glue sticks that are used from the total length: 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to add the money he already has and the money his brother gave him.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends.
His brother gave him $200.

$5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's subtract the total amount he has from the price of the car and the phone.

The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800.
$10000 + $800 = $10800

$5200 (Gabriel's money) is not enough to buy both the car and the phone. 

$10800 (total cost) - $5200 (Gabriel's money) = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600."
"To find the change, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the amount Thea gave the craftsman.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to first calculate how much he spent.

Craig buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so he spends 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so he spends 3 x $3 = $9.

Craig started with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is $40. He spent $12 + $9 = $21.

So, Craig has $40 - $21 = $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks. So, to find out how many socks Jack has, we divide 60 by 2. 
60 / 2 = 30

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, to find out how many socks Peter has, we multiply 30 by 2.
30 * 2 = 60

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. To find the total number of socks, we add 60 + 30.
60 + 30 = 90

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack. So, to find out how many dishes Peter has, we divide 60 by 2.
60 / 2 = 30

Now, we know that Peter has 30 dishes and Jack has 60 dishes. To find the total number of dishes, we add 30 + 60.
30 + 60 = 90

To find the total number of socks and dishes, we add 90 + 90.
90 + 90 = 180"

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time taken by each group and subtract that from the total time of the concert.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time taken by each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. 

Now, let's subtract the time taken by each group from the total time of the concert: 
120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we need to divide the remaining time by the time taken by each group to find out how many groups can perform:
110 / 10 = 11

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

In the first year, Brenda will earn $225 in interest, so she will have $300 + $225 = $525.

In the second year, she will earn $225 in interest again, so she will have $525 + $225 = $750.

In the third year, she will earn $225 in interest again, so she will have $750 + $225 = $975.

So, Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.

The final answer is: $975"
"To find the answer, we need to know how many white shirts have no collars and how many floral shirts have no buttons.

Half of the white shirts have collars, so half of 40 is 20. That means 20 white shirts have collars. So, 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts have no collars.

We know 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find out how many floral shirts have no buttons, we need to subtract 20 from 50. 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts have no buttons.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars. 30 - 20 = 10.

The answer is 10."
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to first find out how many goats were sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats, so he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's subtract the number of goats sold from each farm:
Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

Now, let's add the number of goats left in each farm:
45 + 25 = 70

So, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

The town will have built 120 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am 3 years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of our ages is 87.

Let's use variables to represent the ages:
- Let my age be A.
- My brother's age be B.
- My sister's age be S.
- My mom's age be M.

From the information given:
- A = B - 3 (I am 3 years younger than my brother)
- A = S + 2 (I am 2 years older than my sister)
- M = 3B - 1 (My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)

The sum of our ages is 87:
A + B + S + M = 87

Substituting the expressions for A, B, and M:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
5B - 8 = 87

Add 8 to both sides:
5B = 95

Divide by 5:
B = 19

Now that we know B, we can find A and S:
A = B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16
S = A - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14

So, I am 16 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. The amount of water passing through the river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.
2. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.
3. On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so we need to add 6000 to the amount from the second day, which is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

Total cost: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156

However, Kelly's budget is $65. Since the total cost of the items in her cart is $156, which is more than her budget, she doesn't have enough money to buy all the items.

To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the total cost from her budget:

$65 - $156 = -$91

Since the result is negative, it means she doesn't have enough money to buy all the items in her cart. She is short $91.

Final answer: $-91"
"To find the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert. 

First, we subtract the encore time from the total runtime: 
65 - 15 = 50 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long her usual concerts are. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we divide the result by 2:
50 / 2 = 25 minutes

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had.

Argo had 200 toys initially.
He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky.

First, let's add the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many, so they make 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add them together: 
125 + 125 + 250 = 500

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find out how many microphones he was able to fit in pairs.

The singer has 50 microphones. If 20% of them can't fit, that means 80% of the microphones can fit. 

80% of 50 is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we need to divide 40 by 2 to find the number of pairs.

40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each part separately.

First, we find 2/3 of 6 birds. 
2/3 of 6 is 4.

Then, we find 3 groups of 8 birds.

"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

Total cookies baked = 55
Cookies eaten = 5

Cookies left = Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten
Cookies left = 55 - 5
Cookies left = 50

Now, we need to divide the cookies left by the number of jars.

Number of jars = 5
Cookies in each jar = Cookies left / Number of jars
Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5
Cookies in each jar = 10

The answer is 10."
"To find out how many petals the daisies have, we need to multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals each daisy has. 
4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals

To find out how many petals the orchids have, we need to multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals each orchid has. 
5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals

Now, we need to subtract the number of petals of the orchids from the number of petals of the daisies to find out how many more petals the daisies have. 
40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to find one-fourth of 100. 
One-fourth of 100 is 25. 
So, there are 25 indoor plants.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining plants. 
Remaining plants = Total plants - Indoor plants
Remaining plants = 100 - 25
Remaining plants = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
Two-thirds of 75 is 50. 
So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

Now, we need to find the number of flowering plants. 
Flowering plants = Remaining plants - Outdoor plants
Flowering plants = 75 - 50
Flowering plants = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we need to divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100
Percentage of flowering plants = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to know the speed of the thingamabob first. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11. 

Speed of whatchamacallit = 121 meters per second
Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now, we know the speed of the thingamabob. Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, we need to know the price of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays $6 for the salad and $3 for the yogurt, which is $6 + $3 = $9. Since she pays $11 in total, the remaining amount she pays for the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to first find out how much he makes per day. 

He works 8 hours a day and his pay is $10 an hour. 
8 hours * $10 per hour = $80 per day

He works 5 days a week. 
$80 per day * 5 days = $400 per week

Now, his pay was raised by $2 per hour. 
$10 + $2 = $12 per hour

We need to find out how much he makes per day with the new pay. 
$12 per hour * 8 hours = $96 per day

Now, we need to find out how much he makes per week with the new pay. 
$96 per day * 5 days = $480 per week

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn x times. 
Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for her work, we can set up an equation: 
6x = total amount from mowing lawns

We know that the total amount from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts from mowing each lawn:
6x = 3x + 5x

Combine like terms:
6x = 8x

Now, we need to find the value of x. To do that, we need to know the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns. We know that she made $80 in total, and she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. So, the amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is $80 - $6 = $74.

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times, we can set up another equation:
3x + 5x = 74

Combine like terms:
8x = 74

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 74 / 8
x = 9.25

Now that we know x, we can find the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 9.25
6x = 55.5

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
$80 - $55.5 = $24.5

The final answer is: 24.5"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the information given:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total amount John gets paid, we need to multiply the number of hours he rents his car per month by the number of times he rents it per month, and then multiply that by the amount he gets paid per hour.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so that's 10 x 3 = 30 hours per month.

He gets paid $25 per hour, so 30 hours x $25 per hour = $750 per month.

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from the total amount he gets paid. $750 - $500 = $250.

So, John makes a profit of $250 per month.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can divide 7 by 3 to find out how many notebooks Joseph had.

7 รท 3 = 2.33 (but since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2)

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks. So, she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

12 - 2 = 10

Joseph has 10 fewer notebooks than Martha."

"Let's break it down step by step:

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 
So, Daniel read 13 - 10 = 3 more pages than Denise yesterday.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. 
So, Denise read 3 + 5 = 8 pages today.

Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, he read 0 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read. 
Denise read 8 pages and Daniel read 0 pages. 
So, Denise read 8 - 0 = 8 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many bowls of soup Calvin has, we need to know how many bowls he has in total. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4 + 8 = 12 bowls.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 adults. 

So, the pot can fill 4 adult bowls. This means Calvin has 12 - 4 = 8 bowls of soup left.

Since there are 2 children, we can divide 8 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup. 

8 รท 2 = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's say Adam's current age is x.
2. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, Duncan's age eight years ago was 2x - 4.
3. Since Duncan's current age is 60, we can set up an equation: 60 = 2x - 4 + 8 (because Duncan's age eight years ago was 8 years less than his current age)
4. Simplify the equation: 60 = 2x + 4
5. Subtract 4 from both sides: 56 = 2x
6. Divide both sides by 2: 28 = x

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, they bought 12 balloons. Each balloon costs $0.5, so 12 balloons cost 12 x $0.5 = $6. 

The total money spent so far is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total money spent on ice cream is 2 x $7 = $14.

The total money spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can divide the total money spent by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them. 

$31 / 2 = $15.5

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. So, we can write the equation:

P + (P + 10) + (P - 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

3P = 100

Now, divide both sides by 3:

P = 100 / 3
P = 33.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also see that 33.33 is not a whole number, but we can try to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation.

Let's try P = 33 and P = 34.

If P = 33:
33 + (33 + 10) + (33 - 10) = 33 + 43 + 23 = 99 (not equal to 100)

If P = 34:
34 + (34 + 10) + (34 - 10) = 34 + 44 + 24 = 102 (not equal to 100)

If P = 33.33 is not a whole number, we can try to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation.

Let's try P = 33 and P = 34.

If P = 33:
33 + (33 + 10) + (33 - 10) = 99 (not equal to 100)

If P = 34:
34 + (34 + 10) + (34 - 10) = 102 (not equal to 100)

"Let's count the balloons. 

Maria had 2 balloons at the start. Her friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons. 

Maria had 2 balloons and her friends had 8 balloons, so that's 2 + 8 = 10 balloons. 

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons. 

Now, we add the balloons Maria and her friends had before and the new balloons her mom gave them. 10 + 15 = 25 balloons. 

The answer is 25."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own.

10 people donated 5 boxes each, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 boxes.
They already own 10 boxes, so in total they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey spat 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so she spat a total of 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spat 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so she spat a total of 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance spat = (400 + 420) / 2
Average total distance spat = 820 / 2
Average total distance spat = 410

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine makes in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it makes 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it makes 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In 30 days, it makes 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate the total money Fern will make from each machine. Each widget sells for $6. 

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 43,200 widgets, so Fern will make 43,200 * 6 = $259,200.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 32,400 widgets, so Fern will make 32,400 * 6 = $194,400.

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the money made from the WidgetMaster 9000: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800.

The final answer is: 64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the additional hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Cameron stays for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark, so he needs to add 70 pesos for each of those hours. 5 hours x 70 pesos per hour = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos. 

Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to calculate the amount of hay for each animal.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. 
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. 
So, each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

There are 15 goats and 12 sheep. 
The total amount of hay for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.
The total amount of hay for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay Nate needs is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to do two things:

1. First, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gave to the students. 
   There are 29 students and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. 
   So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

2. Now, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher had initially. 
   The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. 
   So, the total number of bottles the teacher had initially is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

3. Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher had initially. 
   900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to add the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

The fixed charge is $40.
The labor charge is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. So, the labor charge is $35 x 2.25 = $78.75.
The parts charge is $60.

Now, let's add all the charges together: 
$40 (fixed charge) + $78.75 (labor charge) + $60 (parts charge) = $178.75

The total amount Patty charged is $178.75."
"To find out how much James spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the CDs. 

The CDs cost $15 each, and James bought 10 of them. So, the total cost is 10 x $15 = $150.

However, he got them for 40% off. To find 40% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.4. 0.4 x $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

Then, James sells 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling the CDs is 5 x $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James is left with, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he got from selling the CDs. $200 - $90 = $110.

So, James is left with $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will get from selling each type of root crop.

For yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9

For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add up the total amount: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake. 
60% of 20 miles is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

So, James swims 12 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour. 
Time taken to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed = 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. 
Half of 6 hours is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed. 
Half of 2 miles per hour is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time taken to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour = 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

Total time taken = Swimming time + Resting time + Swimming time for the remaining distance
= 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
= 17 hours.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. 

So, we need to multiply 70 by 7, then subtract 40. 

7 x 70 = 490
490 - 40 = 450

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Jasmine was given 15 stickers initially.
She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so she had 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. 
So, she now has 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

The final answer is 13."
"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper and add them together.

For the New York Times, Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy. 
10% of $5 is 0.1 x $5 = $0.50 per copy.
For 6 copies, the commission will be 6 x $0.50 = $3.

For the Wall Street Journal, Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy. 
8% of $15 is 0.08 x $15 = $1.20 per copy.
For 10 copies, the commission will be 10 x $1.20 = $12.

The total commission is $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find Leo's age, we need to know Deanna's age and the relationship between Marcus and Leo. 

We know Deanna is 26 years old. 

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can say Marcus is half of Leo's age. 

Let's say Leo's age is x. Then Marcus's age is x/2.

We also know Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna. So, we can write an equation: x/2 = 26 - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get x/2 = 21

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 42

So, Leo is 42 years old.

42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to know how many points Dinar scored. 

Let's say Dinar scored x points. 
Since Azibo scored 10 more points than Dinar, Azibo scored x + 10 points. 
Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored (x + 10) + 20 points. 

We know that the total points is 45. So, we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms: 
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides: 
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 5

So, Dinar scored 5 points. 
Azibo scored 5 + 10 = 15 points.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, and each paper is 2 pages thick (one on each side). 

So, we multiply 1.5 inches by 2 pages per inch. 

1.5 * 2 = 3

There are 3 pages in the book."
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports.

He stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes to get 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15.

900 รท 15 = 60

So, Vince stapled 60 sets of 15 minutes. Since each set has 30 reports, we multiply 60 by 30.

60 ร 30 = 1800

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, she woke up at 5:55 p.m. (10 p.m. - 5 minutes).

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 2:15 a.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. 

To find the total time she was asleep, we need to subtract the start time from the end time. 

5:55 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3 hours 40 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 3 hours to minutes by multiplying 3 by 60. 

3 * 60 = 180 minutes

Now, we add the 40 minutes to the 180 minutes. 

180 + 40 = 220 minutes

So, Kim slept for 220 minutes on her bed that day."
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons he had initially. 

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 2 dozen cups, we need to convert 2 dozen to the number of cups. 

1 dozen = 12, so 2 dozen = 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can find the number of measuring spoons: 
2/3 of 24 cups = (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so he is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan initially had 24 cups and 16 measuring spoons. Now he has 24 cups and 10 measuring spoons. 

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 + 10 = 34.

34"
"To find the number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds

So, there are 100 occupied beds.

Now, we need to find the number of unoccupied beds. 

1000 - 100 = 900 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to subtract 50 * 14 (for 2 weeks) from the total number of beds.

50 * 14 = 700

Now, subtract 700 from 900.

900 - 700 = 200

So, there are 200 unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. 
   Total emails sent per day = 16
   Work emails = 7
   Emails not work emails = Total emails - Work emails
   Emails not work emails = 16 - 7
   Emails not work emails = 9

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these emails are to family. 
   Emails to family = 2/3 of the emails not work emails
   Emails to family = 2/3 * 9
   Emails to family = 6

3. Now, we need to find out how many emails are to her boyfriend. 
   Emails to boyfriend = Emails not work emails - Emails to family
   Emails to boyfriend = 9 - 6
   Emails to boyfriend = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age is 3 x 3 = 9 years old.

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, Shawna's father's age is 5 x 9 = 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people, we need to find 20% of 48 and subtract it from 48.

20% of 48 is 0.2 x 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jason carried 2 balls.
2. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.
4. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

The coach brought 7 balls to practice.

7"
"To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day, we add the holes dug each day: 
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we multiply the number of holes by 4: 
31 * 4 = 124 holes.

Now, we subtract the holes dug on the third day (8) and the holes filled in (2) from the total number of holes: 
124 - 8 - 2 = 114 holes.

The pirates dug 114 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each. Since they are sharing the corn chips equally, we can say that the number of corn chips each person gets is 70.

Now, we know that Collins got 15 more corn chips than the number the others got. So, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add the number of corn chips each person got. 

70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225.

225"
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the supplies cost and add it to the supplies cost.

The supplies cost $400. 
50% of $400 is 0.5 x 400 = $200.

The travel cost is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokรฉmon.

Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokรฉmon.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught 4x - 13 + 5 Pokรฉmon.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokรฉmon, so we can write an equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:

x + 4x + 4x - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339

Combine like terms again:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokรฉmon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokรฉmon.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2. 

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = 20 / 2 = 10

Now, we multiply the total episodes by the total minutes per episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200

The answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled.

The bird first flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 10
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 * 2
Distance = 36 miles

The bird then flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 * 5
Distance = 110 miles

To find the total distance, we need to add the distances traveled in each direction.
Total Distance = 300 + 36 + 110
Total Distance = 446 miles

The bird's northern home is 446 miles away from her southern home."
"To find out how many brownies Greta had left, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She made 1 dozen brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies.

At the office party, she got 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies she received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to find the ages of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 8 x 2 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, so we need to find 25% of Nani's age. 
25% of 8 is 0.25 x 8 = 2 years.

So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6).

The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Carlton's team has 13 players.
Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, let's add the number of players in both teams: 13 + 20 = 33

There are 33 players in both teams combined."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. 

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The answer is 100."
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had left, we need to do some math.

She bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box has 20 oranges. So, she had 12 x 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. That's 4 x 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges. 1/4 of 240 is 60 oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges she had left. She had 240 - 80 - 60 = 100 oranges.

She sold the rest, which is 100 oranges.

"To find out how much money Tyler needs, we need to add the prices of the books together. 

$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Tyler has $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we need to divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage. 

$25 รท $5 = 5

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to know how many Richard has. 

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can subtract 10 from 30 to find out how many Richard has. 
30 - 10 = 20

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. 
To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60. 
60 - 50 = 10

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries. 
30 - 10 = 20

Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Emil's current age is 19, and his dad's current age is x, and his brother's current age is y.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write an equation: 
24 = x/2

To find x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 24 * 2
x = 48

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, we can write another equation:
24 = 2y

To find y, we divide both sides by 2:
y = 24 / 2
y = 12

Now that we know the current ages of Emil's dad (48) and brother (12), we can find the sum of their ages:
48 + 12 = 60

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Now, let's calculate the space needed for each plant and the space between them. 

Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there is 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. 
So, the total space needed for each plant and the space between them is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, let's divide the total space by the space needed for each plant and the space between them to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. 

1332 / 30 = 44.4

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so Pat will spend 27 * 6 = $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 1 shrimp.

She can peel 6 shrimp in 10 minutes. So, to peel 1 shrimp, it will take her 10/6 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it will take her to peel 90 shrimp. 
90 shrimp / 6 shrimp = 15 sets of 6 shrimp
Since it takes her 10 minutes to peel 6 shrimp, it will take her 15 x 10 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.
15 x 10 = 150 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it will take her to cook 90 shrimp. She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. So, to cook 1 shrimp, it will take her 10/30 minutes.
10/30 = 1/3 minutes
To cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 x 1/3 minutes.
90 x 1/3 = 30 minutes

So, it will take her 150 minutes to peel 90 shrimp and 30 minutes to cook 90 shrimp. 
To find the total time, we add 150 + 30 = 180 minutes.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, we can find the number of years that have passed since then. 

Let's say the number of years that have passed is x. 
So, x = 75 * number of times the comet has orbited the sun. 
Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, we can say that x = 30. 
Now, we can solve for the number of times the comet has orbited the sun: 
75 * number of times the comet has orbited the sun = 30 
number of times the comet has orbited the sun = 30 / 75 
number of times the comet has orbited the sun = 0.4 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can multiply 0.4 by 75 to find the number of years that have passed: 
number of years that have passed = 0.4 * 75 
number of years that have passed = 30 

Now, we know that 30 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet. 
We also know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his dad's age at that time. 
So, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time = 3 * 30 
Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time = 90 

Now, we need to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 
Since 30 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, we can subtract 30 from Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time: 
Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 90 - 30 
Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 60 

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. He writes 1 check per month for the electric bill and the gas bill, so that's 2 checks per month.
2. He writes 2 checks per month for the church, so that's 2 more checks per month.
3. He writes 1 check per quarter for the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so that's 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks per month: 2 (electric and gas) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month.

Now, multiply the total number of checks per month by 12: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks per year.

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.

The second plane flies 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 trips.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to first find the length of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up the time of all three wolves' howls: 
20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). 
120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first find out how much money Adam's parents gave him.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 x $6 = $12.

Adam's parents gave him $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we need to subtract the money his parents gave him from the price of the trousers.

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.
3. Let's add the ages of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7
4. Since the total age of the children is 20, we subtract the sum of Akbar and Alessandro's ages from the total age: 20 - 7 = 13
5. Now we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's call the average age 'x'. We can write an equation: 2x = 13
6. To find the average age 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 13 / 2 = 6.5
7. Now we know the average age of the group is 6.5. Since there are 4 children, we multiply the average age by 4 to find the total age: 6.5 * 4 = 26
8. However, we already know the total age is 20, so we need to find the age of Wilfred. We subtract the sum of Akbar and Alessandro's ages from the total age: 20 - 7 = 13
9. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can set up an equation: 2x = 13, where x is the average age. We already know the average age is 6.5, so we can find Helene's age: 2 * 6.5 = 13
10. Now we know Helene's age is 13. We subtract Helene's age from the total age to find Wilfred's age: 20 - 13 = 7

The age of Wilfred is 7."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first find out how much money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 
500 + 1500 = 2000

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has collected $2000, his lawyer will contribute 3 * 2000 = 6000.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of 100 guests. 

Half of 100 is 50. Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide 50 by 15 to find out how many people were in the church.

50 รท 15 = 3.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we can round down to 3 people."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the total number of slices. Let's say the total number of slices is x.

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

We know that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Let's say each kid gets a slice of y. Then, each adult gets 2y.

Since there are 2 adults, the total number of slices they get is 2 * 2y = 4y.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: 4y = 6.

To solve for y, we divide both sides by 4: y = 6/4 = 1.5.

So each kid gets a slice of 1.5. Each adult gets 2 * 1.5 = 3 slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices they get by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

Percentage of watermelon each adult gets = (3/6) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his tasks.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on tasks: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the time spent on tasks from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

First, we add the time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Then, we add the time to bake the cake: 20 + 30 = 50 minutes
Next, we add the time to cool the cake: 50 + 120 minutes = 170 minutes
Finally, we add the time to frost the cake: 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract 3 hours from the serving time to find the latest start time. 
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to add the number of boxes Lisa and Peter sold. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

Now, we know they sold 8 boxes together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars in total. 
64 รท 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students.

Cost of renting the studio: $25 per session, 3 days a week, for a month (assuming a month has 4 weeks) is $25 * 3 * 4 = $300.

Cost of the students: 10 students, $1.50 per student per session, 3 days a week, for a month is $1.50 * 10 * 3 * 4 = $180.

Total earnings: $300 (renting) + $180 (students) = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. To do this, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box.

16 (Peter's box) - 8 (Martha's box) = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

3/5 of 50 is 3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. In a year, there are 12 months. 

So, the total number of babies born in a year is 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we need to add the babies to the total population. 

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Length (L) = 25 feet
Width (W) = 14 feet
Depth (D) = 4 feet

Volume = L * W * D = 25 * 14 * 4 = 1400 cubic feet

Now, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in 1 cubic foot. 

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48 = 10480 gallons

The pool company needs to fill the pool with 10480 gallons of water. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = 10480 * 0.10 = $1048

The cost to fill the pool is $1048."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to know the number of blue sticks first. 

There are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so there are 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

Now, let's add up all the sticks: 
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how far Matteo traveled, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

To find out how far Shandy traveled, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between Shandy's distance and Matteo's distance. 

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
= 450 miles - 220 miles
= 230 miles

The answer is 230."
"To find the number of female students, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. 
So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. 
So, the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. 
So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male. 
So, the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old and under 16 years old. 
So, the total number of male students is 375 + 750 = 1125.

Since the total number of students is 3000, the number of female students is 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run.

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts.

First, let's say the initial charge of the power bank was x.

Since the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours, the charge remaining after 5 hours would be:

x - (9% of x) * 5
x - 0.09x * 5
x - 0.45x
0.55x

Now, for the next 3 hours, the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, the charge remaining after 3 hours would be:

0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3
0.55x - 0.07 * 0.55x * 3
0.55x - 0.1025x
0.4475x

The charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4475x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4475:

x = 0.28 / 0.4475
x = 0.628

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 62.8%."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save, we need to calculate 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 x $10,000 = $2,000.

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total hourly income is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide $2,000 by $25.

$2,000 รท $25 = 80 hours.

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we need to divide 80 hours by 40 hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work.

80 hours รท 40 hours = 2 weeks.

The answer is 2."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first find out how much money he has left after buying the fruits he already has.

He bought 3 peaches for $.5 each, so 3 x $.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears for $.5 each, so 4 x $.5 = $2
He bought 2 kiwis for $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples for $.75 each, so 5 x $.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, we get $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Since plums cost $.25 each, we can divide $1 by $.25 to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 รท $.25 = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to first find out how many pieces of sweets Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs, so she gave 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 13 * 60 = 780.

Since she gave the sweets to 10 friends, each friend received 780 / 10 = 78 pieces.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the original price. 
5% of $120 = 0.05 * 120 = $6
New price = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the new price. 
5% of $126 = 0.05 * 126 = $6.30
New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
The price of carrots increases by 5% of the new price. 
5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * 132.30 = $6.615
New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

1. The hotel initially had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the hotel had 100 - 24 = 76 guests left.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the hotel had 76 - 15 = 61 guests left.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.
5. So, the hotel had 61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the hotel now has 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

John picked 4 bananas on Wednesday.
He picked 6 bananas on Thursday.

Now, let's add them together: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas."
"To find out how many easy questions Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate 75% of 40% of 60 questions.

First, we find 40% of 60 questions: 
40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions

Since Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, we multiply 24 by 0.75:
24 * 0.75 = 18 questions

Now, we need to find out how many average and difficult questions there are. Since 40% are easy, the remaining 60% are divided equally between average and difficult questions. 
60% of 60 = 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions

Since these 36 questions are divided equally between average and difficult questions, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 / 2 = 9 questions.

Now, we add the questions Aries is sure to get from easy, average, and difficult questions:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36 questions

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a small stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold 'y' large stuffed animals. Then, she sold 2y small stuffed animals.

The total amount she earned from selling small stuffed animals is 2y * 4 = 8y dollars.

The total amount she earned from selling large stuffed animals is y * 3x dollars.

We know that the total amount she earned is $120. So, we can set up the equation:

8y + 3yx = 120

Since we don't know the price of a large stuffed animal (3x), we need to find a way to get rid of it. We can do this by noticing that the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal. So, we can substitute x = 4 (since each small stuffed animal costs $4).

Now, the equation becomes:

8y + 3y * 12 = 120

Combine like terms:

8y + 36y = 120

Combine like terms again:

44y = 120

Now, divide both sides by 44:

y = 120 / 44
y = 2.73 (round down to 2, since you can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal)

So, Teresa sold 2 large stuffed animals and 2 * 2 = 4 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to add up the number of sandwiches each person eats per day.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches per day is: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

There are 7 days in a week. To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we multiply the number of sandwiches per day by 7.

11 sandwiches per day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she earned 80 x $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she earned 60 x $4 = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings together: $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, let's subtract the money she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the 10 eggs that were not found.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 60 were found by the Smith twins, so 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were left.

We also know that 10 eggs were not found. So, the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To find the answer, we need to calculate how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 
He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 
50% of 24 pounds is 24 * 0.5 = 12 pounds. 
So, one dwarf can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. 
40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days. 
40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day. 
In 30 days, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is 43200."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich first. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package to find the total price: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first find out how much he still owes for the bedroom set after selling his old one.

Tom bought the bedroom set for $3000 and sold his old one for $1000. So, he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Now, he has to pay 10% of $2000 per month. To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.1 (which is 10% in decimal form).

$2000 * 0.1 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

   So, the remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15.

2. Calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released:
   Half of the yellow balloons = 1/2 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons were released.

   So, the remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6.

3. Calculate the number of blue balloons Sally found:
   75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

4. Calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:
   Total balloons = remaining red balloons + remaining yellow balloons + blue balloons = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to find the total probability of the following events: 

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (100% - 40% = 60% chance).
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension (40% chance).
3. The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension (100% - 50% = 50% chance).

Now, we need to find the total probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework. 

The probability of the normal teacher coming in and not giving an extension is 60% * 50% = 30%.
The probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension is 40% * 50% = 20%.
The probability of the substitute teacher coming in and not giving an extension is 50% * 60% = 30%.

Now, we add these probabilities together: 30% + 20% + 30% = 80%.

So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 80% = 20%.

20%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate will get, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 รท 950 = 5

So, each graduate will get 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first find out how many medium beans he can eat. 

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3 to find out how many small beans he can eat. 

150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

50"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour, we need to first find out how much she makes in total and then divide it by the number of hours she works.

Melissa works for 3 days, 6 hours a day. So, she works a total of 3 x 6 = 18 hours.

She is paid $15 per day, so she makes 3 x $15 = $45 in total.

She also pays $3 for parking each day, so she pays 3 x $3 = $9 in total for parking.

Now, we subtract the parking expenses from her total earnings: $45 - $9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour, we divide her total earnings by the number of hours she works: $36 รท 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much Ted spent, we need to add the cost of the books and pencils.

The cost of 3 books is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.

Ted spent 66 dollars in total."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first find out how many bottles he will put along his driveway.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. 

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many seconds it will take Richard to go from one bottle to the next. It takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.

Since there are 8 bottles, and he needs to go from one bottle to the next 7 times, we multiply 5 seconds by 7.

5 seconds * 7 = 35 seconds

So, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. He has 2 boxes of apples, and each box has 40 apples. 

So, the total number of apples is 2 x 40 = 80 apples.

Now, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one pack, which is 8.

80 รท 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 11 x 2 = $22.

Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of mozzarella cheese is 6 x 3 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the amount she started with: $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find out how much money Jim lost while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he lost. 

He had a $25,000 a year job and didn't work for 4 years. So, the total amount of money he lost is $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned from his job after college. His income tripled, so he earned $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year. 

Since he worked for 4 years after college, he earned $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

Now, let's add the money he lost while in school and the money he earned after college. $100,000 + $300,000 = $400,000.

Since Jim got $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of money he needs to pay back is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

To find out how long it will take him to pay back the loans, we need to divide the total amount of money he needs to pay back by the amount of money he earns per year after college. $200,000 / $75,000 = 2.67 years.

So, it will take Jim approximately 2.67 years to pay back the loans.

"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter first. 

The comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the comforter's dimensions are:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we multiply the length and width to find the area:
8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

The final answer is: 160"

"To find out how much Johnny lost on average, we need to first find out how much he won and lost in each race.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. He lost $5, so twice that is $10. He won $1 more than that, so he won $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. He won $11, so 1.5 times that is $16.5. He lost $16.5.

Now, let's add up all the money he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average, we need to divide the total amount he lost by the number of races, which is 3. 

$21.5 รท 3 = $7.17

The average amount he lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the number of people in each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to add the amount they grew to their original heights.

Cole's original height was 50 inches. He grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Xavier's original height was 4 feet, which is 48 inches. He grew 3 inches, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between their new heights. 

52 (Cole's height) - 51 (Xavier's height) = 1 inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find out how much money each person took.

Let's say the first person took x dollars.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + 80 dollars.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours of work, we need to first find the total number of days the painters worked. 

There are 7 days in a week, and they worked for 3 weeks. 
3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

They worked 3/8ths of a day each day. 
3/8 * 21 days = 7.875 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 7.875 days by 24 hours/day. 
7.875 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours

There are 4 painters. To find the hours of work each painter did, we divide the total hours by 4. 
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables. Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x.

In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x/2 balls.

We know that the total number of balls he retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls Rory retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $4200. So, the car is worth $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $3322. So, the car is worth $15800 - $3322 = $12578.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12578, which is $2649.58. So, the car is worth $12578 - $2649.58 = $9888.42.

The price of the car in 2010 is $9888.42."

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The visit is 30 minutes long, so we need to convert it to hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. The cost of the visit is $300/hour, so the total cost of the visit is 0.5 * $300 = $150.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the painkillers. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the total cost of the painkillers is 30 * $4 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the parking. The cost of the parking is $6/hour, and Hannah needs to pay for 2 hours. So, the total cost of the parking is 2 * $6 = $12.

Finally, let's add up the costs of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking. The total cost is $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

x - x/4 = 60
x - x/3 = 60

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 12 (the least common multiple of 4 and 3):

12x - 3x = 720
9x = 720

Now, divide both sides by 9:

x = 80

So, Maggie and Riza initially had $80.

Now, let's find out how much money they have left:

Maggie spent x/4 = 80/4 = 20 dollars.
Riza spent x/3 = 80/3 = 26.67 dollars.

Maggie has 80 - 20 = 60 dollars left.
Riza has 80 - 26.67 = 53.33 dollars left.

The total amount of money they have left is 60 + 53.33 = 113.33 dollars.

The final answer is: 113.33"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to know how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas a day.

The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas a day.

There are 7 days in a week. 
315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day for all three monkeys.

Since the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas a day, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas a day.

The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed in an hour, we need to first find out how many pieces he placed in total. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, so he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. So, in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The answer is 750."
"To find out how much Jenny spent on roses, we need to know how many dozens of roses she bought. 

Since she bought 15 roses, and a dozen is 12, she bought 15 / 12 = 1 dozen and 3 roses. 

A dozen roses cost $15, so 1 dozen roses cost $15. 3 roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. 

So, Jenny spent $15 + $6 = $21 on roses.

Jenny has 5 dollars. To find out how much change she needs, we subtract the cost of roses from the money she has: $5 - $21 = -$16. Since she can't have a negative amount of money, this means she doesn't have enough money to buy the roses. 

However, if we assume she has more money, let's calculate the change. 

The change she needs is $21 - $5 = $16. Since the florist only has quarters, we need to divide $16 by $0.25 (the value of a quarter) to find out how many quarters she needs: $16 / $0.25 = 64 quarters.

So, Jenny needs 64 quarters as change."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the money from each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the money from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33

9 burger platters * $11 = $99

Then, let's calculate the money from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the money from each item together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The total amount of money Terry makes is $162."
"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves the station in 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival. The first train arrives in 10 minutes, and the fourth train arrives in 145 minutes. So, Paul will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves each week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we need to divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves each week (10).

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

80"
"To find the original price, we need to calculate 75% of the original price of the watch. 

75% of 2000 is 0.75 * 2000 = 1500. 

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, he sold it for 1.2 * 1500 = 1800.

The original price of the watch is 2000. The price Mr. Rogers sold it for is 1800. 

The discount is 2000 - 1800 = 200.

To find the percentage discount, we need to divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100. 

(200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours. Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it will create 60 jellyfish (60 seconds in 1 hour). In 4 hours, it will create 60 * 4 = 240 jellyfish.

Now, we have 5 springs working at the same rate. To find out how many jellyfish they create in 4 hours, we multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours by 5. 

So, 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first find twice Binkie's score. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice that is 90 * 2 = 180.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the time it took James to reach the store, we need to first find the total distance he walked. 

He walked 4 miles to the store and then 4 miles back home. So, the total distance is 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, we can divide the total distance by his speed to find the time it took him to walk the total distance.

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

The answer is 2."
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to first find out how much she would have paid if she bought the bananas individually. 

She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she bought 10 x 4 = 40 bananas. 

The price of one banana is $0.80. So, 40 bananas will cost 40 x $0.80 = $32. 

Now, she bought 10 bunches for $3.00 each. So, 10 x $3.00 = $30. 

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually. $32 - $30 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Then, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence. 

Since they have 100 feet of fence in total, we can write an equation: 
x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 
2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 
2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

Now, let's find out how much is left over for Sam: 
100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to multiply the number of years it grows 8 inches in by 3.33 (13 years / 4 years).

"To find out how many bikes of each type were sold, we need to calculate the number of each type.

First, we know that half of the bikes were Trekking bikes. Since there were 300 bikes in total, half of them would be 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

We also know that 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes. To find 15% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.15. 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, we know that the rest of the bikes were MTB. We already know that there were 150 Trekking bikes and 45 BMX bikes. So, the number of MTB bikes is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

Now, we know the number of each type of bike sold. We can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of each type of bike by its price.

The price of a Trekking bike is $450, so 150 * 450 = $67,500.
The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so it's $250. 45 * 250 = $11,250.
The price of an MTB is $500. 105 * 500 = $52,500.

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. So, in one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales and the truck picks up 3 bales. 

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer. 

5 (bales made by farmer) - 3 (bales picked up by truck) = 2 bales left in the field.

Since they work for 6 hours, we need to multiply the number of bales left in the field by 6.

2 * 6 = 12

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

12"
"To find out how many minutes John spends in class, we need to multiply the number of classes by the class duration.

Number of classes = 2 (normal classes) + 2 (extra classes) = 4 classes
Class duration = 40 minutes
Total minutes per week = 4 classes * 40 minutes = 160 minutes

Since John goes to class 5 days a week, we multiply the total minutes by 5.

Total minutes per week = 160 minutes * 5 = 800 minutes

Now, we need to add the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. 
Extra learning time per day = 1/16 * 60 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
Extra learning time per day = 1/16 * 60 = 3.75 minutes
Total extra learning time per week = 3.75 minutes * 2 days = 7.5 minutes

Now, we add the total minutes per week and the extra learning time per week.

Total minutes per week = 800 minutes + 7.5 minutes = 807.5 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Total hours per week = 807.5 minutes / 60 = 13.456 hours

"To find out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat. Since they ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, that means the T-Rex ate half of what was left after the Allosaurus ate.

So, the Allosaurus ate half of what was left, and the T-Rex ate half of what was left. To find the total amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate, we need to multiply the amount the Allosaurus ate by 2.

270 * 2 = 540 kilograms

Now, since the T-Rex ate half of what was left, we need to multiply the amount the T-Rex ate by 2 to find the total amount of meat left before the T-Rex ate.

540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms

So, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

"To find the total area of the room, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each one is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. There are two of them, so the total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each one is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. There are two of them, so the total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the walls together: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The paint costs $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, so there is 1 shaken soda left.

Ellen's friend came along, so there are 3 people left: Ellen, her brother, and her friend.

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas left divided by the number of people left. 

So, the likelihood is 1 (shaken soda left) / 3 (people left) = 1/3 or approximately 33.33%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to find the distance each train travels in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. 
Distance = Speed x Time

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so it's traveling at 30 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 x 3
Distance = 90 miles

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, so we need to find 20% of 31. 

20% of 31 is 0.2 x 31 = 6.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 6 days. 

Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days. 

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 x 3 = 6 people per day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and these are the large jellyfish that change color. So, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Since Lauren lives with 40% of her current salary, she spends $40,000 per year. 

So, she saves $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000 per year. This means she actually spends more than she saves.

However, we are given that she wants to save for 20 years. To find out how much she needs to save, we need to know how much she needs for retirement. 

Let's assume she wants to save x dollars for retirement. Since she saves $20,000 per year, she will need x / 20 years to save that amount.

We know that she will live with 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000 per year. So, she needs to save $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 for retirement.

Now, we can set up an equation: x / 20 = $60,000

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 20: x = $60,000 * 20
x = $1,200,000

Since Lauren saves $20,000 per year, she needs 1,200,000 / 20,000 = 60 years to save $1,200,000.

However, she wants to live with 40% of her current salary for 20 years. So, she will live with $40,000 * 20 = $800,000 in 20 years.

Now, we need to find out how much she needs to save for 20 years to live with $800,000. Since she saves $20,000 per year, she will need $800,000 / 20 = $40,000 per year.

Since she already saves $20,000 per year, she needs to save an additional $40,000 - $20,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to save $20,000, we divide $20,000 by $20,000: 20,000 / 20,000 = 1 year.

So, Lauren needs to work for 1 more year to save enough money to live with $800,000 in 20 years.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had.

Raymond had $21 initially.
He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had $16 initially and $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

She bought 2 books, and they cost the same amount of money. 

To find out the cost of each book, we need to divide the total money spent on the books ($14) by 2. 

$14 รท 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7."
"To find the number of students this year, we need to calculate 20% of 50 and add it to 50.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10.

So, the number of new students is 10. 

Now, we add 10 to the original number of students: 50 + 10 = 60.

There are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year."
"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find out how many times it blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 
So, it blinks 255 / 5 = 51 times per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to blink 459 times. 
We can do this by dividing 459 by 51. 
459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:
Female fishes: 8
Male fishes: 6

To find the difference, subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes:
8 - 6 = 2

The answer is 2."
"To find out how long it took Megan to walk the dog, we need to add 2 hours to Amalia's time. 
Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours
Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours
Megan's time = 6 hours

To find out how long it took Dior to do laundry, we need to add 4 hours to Amalia's time.
Dior's time = Amalia's time + 4 hours
Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours
Dior's time = 8 hours

Now, we need to add up the time for all three people to find the total time.
Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we need to multiply this by 2. 

140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total round trip distance by 2.

280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how far Brian will walk, we need to know how far Sofie will walk. 

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk 10 x 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we need to divide 70 miles by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk. 

70 รท 2 = 35 miles.

Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we need to first find out how many toys the first 4 workers produce in total.

The first 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 x 6 = 12 toys per hour.
The other 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 x 4 = 8 toys per hour.

So, the first 4 workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, and the first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, the fifth worker must produce 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide 20 toys by 10 hours. 

20 รท 10 = 2

The fifth worker produces 2 toys per hour."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs together. 
15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

So, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh 45 pounds altogether."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. This means Luis got half of Seth's stickers. Let's say Seth had x stickers. Then, Luis got x/2 stickers.

Luis used half of the stickers he got, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4 stickers. He gave the rest to Kris, so Kris got x/2 - x/4 = x/4 stickers.

Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. Since Kris got x/4 stickers, we can set up the equation: x/4 = 16.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 16 * 4 = 64.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

64"
"To find out how many M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag. 

3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces

Since each ounce has 30 M&M's, we multiply 30 ounces by 30 M&M's per ounce.

30 ounces * 30 M&M's = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make with 900 M&M's. 

Each small bag has 10 M&M's. 

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the way around the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the way around the earth by the distance Alfie flies each day.

Half the way around the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide 20,000 by 400 (the distance Alfie flies each day):

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half the way around the earth.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.
   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The faster car goes 750 Miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number x.
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we can say Sarah painted x - 12 eggs.
- The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.

We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x - 12) + x + (x - 12) = 56

Combine like terms:

3x - 24 = 56

Add 24 to both sides:

3x = 80

Divide by 3:

x = 26.67

Since we can't paint a fraction of an egg, we'll round down to 26 eggs for Arnold and Madeline.

Camden painted 26 + 12 = 38 eggs.

Camden painted 38 - 26 = 12 more eggs than Arnold.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with crayons. 

Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons. 

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons is 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

Now, we need to convert the weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide 200 ounces by 16.

200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons is 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces. Converting this to pounds, we get 200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 12.5 pounds (crayons) + 12.5 pounds (boxes) = 25 pounds.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet / 4 feet per log = 20 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs * 5 planks per log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2 per plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month. 

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 x $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk. 

First, we know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk compared to the beach. 

So, if 40 minutes is the time it takes her to walk 2 miles on the beach, then it will take her 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. 

Now, we know that she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk and 2 miles on the beach. So, the total time it takes her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 20 minutes (sidewalk) + 40 minutes (beach) = 60 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first find out how much she has saved so far.

She saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 x 8 = $32.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has saved so far from the total amount she wants to save, which is $60.

$60 - $32 = $28

So, she still needs to save $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide $28 by $4 to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save $28.

$28 รท $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

   Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24. So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 
   To find out how many marbles he has now, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 
   60 - 24 = 36

2. Now, we know that Bob has 36 marbles. 
   If he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36. 
   36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's first find out how much water Donny has in the second mug. 

Donny has 2 mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. So, he has 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. 

Since he can drink the water now, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. 

Now, let's find out how much water was in the second mug. We know that the total amount of water is 5 ounces, and 4 ounces came from the 33-degree mug. So, the second mug has 5 - 4 = 1 ounce of water.

Since Donny can drink the water now, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees. 

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens first.

Initially, there were 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melanie's father gets 20 cows per day from Milkie Cows Limited. 
There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are 3 x 7 = 21 days. 
So, he gets 20 cows per day for 21 days, which is 20 x 21 = 420 cows.

Melanie's father gets 10 chickens per day from Broilers Limited. 
So, he gets 10 x 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of cows and chickens to the new ones:
Cows: 50 + 420 = 470
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 + 230 = 700.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00. 

10% of $40.00 is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost. 

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, we need to find the cost of one bagel. 

There are 9 bagels in each pack.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We know that 3 scoops of mashed potatoes take 6 potatoes.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. 
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total eggs eaten in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide 240 eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs.

1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, so that's 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing both purple and bows.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. We know 2 babies are wearing both purple and bows, and 1/3 of the blue wearers also wear bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are wearing blue, that's 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies wearing blue. So, 1/3 * 2 = 2/3 of the blue wearers are wearing bows. 

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (both purple and bows) + 2/3 * 2 (blue and bows) = 2 + 4/3 = 10/3.

Total reports received on all days = 5168

First, let's add the reports received on Monday and Thursday: 
1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, let's subtract the total reports received on Monday and Thursday from the total reports received on all days:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"Abraham started with 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, so he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. He then sold 1/4 of the remaining land for $30, which is 80 - 40 = 40 square meters. 

Now, he has 40 - 40 = 0 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. Since he has no land left, he can't sell any more. 

The total money he earned is $50 + $30 = $80."
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Haley is 26 years old. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. So, we subtract 10 from 13. 
13 - 10 = 3.

Geb is 3 years old.

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in one day. 

He changes his face mask 2 times a day, and he goes out 3 times a day. So, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks in one day.

Now, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days. We can multiply the number of face masks he uses in one day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12, Cole hid 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by all of them: 
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and then multiply it by the amount he gets paid per apartment.

First, let's find out how many apartments are in the last complex. Since it's 60% bigger than the other two combined, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

Now, let's find 60% of 400. 60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240.

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we know that John collects garbage from 3 complexes, and he collects 3 times a week. So, he collects garbage from 3 * 3 = 9 times a week.

The total number of apartments he collects garbage from is 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440.

He gets paid $0.40 per apartment, so he makes 1440 * 0.40 = $576 per week.

The final answer is 576."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

The total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is 52500."
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100.

Jack has $120 now."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the length of the yellow rope is Y.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the blue rope is Y - 7.
3. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7).
4. The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37.
5. Simplify the equation: Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37.
6. Combine like terms: 6Y - 35 = 37.
7. Add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72.
8. Divide both sides by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope: 4 * (Y - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Rissa and Ronnie had initially. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so if Ronnie had $5, Rissa had 3 x 5 = $15.

Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so she had 4/5 of her money left. 4/5 of $15 is 4/5 x 15 = $12.

This means Rissa gave $15 - $12 = $3 to her sister.

Now, we know that Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so Ronnie also gave $3.

Ronnie had $5 initially and gave $3, so she has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how many pints of red paint were used, we need to know that half the mural is yellow. Since there are 4 colors and equal amounts of red, white, and purple, that means each color has 1/3 of the mural. 

If half the mural is yellow, that means 1/2 of the mural is yellow. Since 1/2 is the same as 3/4, we can say 3/4 of the mural is not yellow. 

So, 3/4 of the mural is red, white, and purple. Since there are 3 colors, we can divide 3/4 by 3 to find out how much of the mural each color covers. 

3/4 รท 3 = 1/4

So, each color covers 1/4 of the mural. Since the mural is 1 whole, we can multiply 1/4 by 1 to find out how much of the mural each color covers. 

1/4 * 1 = 1/4

Since 1/4 of the mural is red, we can multiply 1/4 by the total amount of paint used to find out how many pints of red paint were used. 

1/4 * 12 = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, the area of the living room is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 + 1200 + 1000 = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"To find out how many cycles you can run, we need to first find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 
20% of 100 is 0.2 * 100 = 20. 
So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

You can run 1 cycle for every pod. 
So, you can run 120 cycles with the new box.

To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the number of cycles by the cost of the new box. 
The cost of the new box is $12. 
120 cycles / $12 = 10 cycles per dollar.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he has 50 bills initially.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half. Team A scores 1/4 of 8 goals, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals."

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 3 inches of chalk (5 - 2 = 3).

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 3 inches, we need to divide 3 by 0.2.

3 / 0.2 = 15

So, the teacher will have 15 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

There are 12 girls and one-third of them are on varsity. 
One-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4. 
So, 4 girls are on varsity.

In total, 3 + 4 = 7 students are on varsity.

2/5 of 4000 is (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600

So, Mr. Marcellus returned 1600 gallons of milk.

The cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon. To find the total refund, we multiply the number of gallons returned by the cost per gallon.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Wendy's current age is W and Colin's current age is C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This means that Wendy's current age is 5 times Colin's age 7 years from now. 

So, we can write an equation: W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This means that Colin's age 25 years from now is 1/3 of Wendy's current age. 

So, we can write another equation: C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them by substituting the first equation into the second one.

W = 5(C + 7)
W = 5C + 35

Now, substitute W into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

- After another 15 minutes, 2 more snowballs will melt, so we have 46 - 2 = 44 snowballs.
- After another 15 minutes, 2 more snowballs will melt, so we have 44 - 2 = 42 snowballs.
- After another 15 minutes, 2 more snowballs will melt, so we have 42 - 2 = 40 snowballs.
- After another 15 minutes, 2 more snowballs will melt, so we have 40 - 2 = 38 snowballs.
- After another 15 minutes, 2 more snowballs will melt, so we have 38 - 2 = 36 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of bandages they started with is x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered 2 packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, they had x + 84 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides of the equation: x = 78 - 59.

x = 19.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. 
He buys 10 bottles of scotch, so he buys 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 x $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, so he planted 2 x 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.
- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, so he planted 40 + (1/4 x 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:
- White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted: 50 + 90 = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to subtract the amount that was drunk or spilled each day.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were drunk, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were drunk, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Now, 5 gallons of root beer were shared equally among 3 people, so each person got 5 / 3 = 1.67 gallons.

The final answer is 1.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is x.
2. ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" means we need to multiply the number of coffee mugs by 4 and then add 8.
3. So, the equation is: 4x + 8 = 40
4. To solve for x, we need to subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8
5. 4x = 32
6. To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 32 / 4
7. x = 8

There are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to find one-third of 66. 

66 / 3 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the remaining fish. 

66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of 44. 

44 / 11 = 4

So, 4 fish have blue stripes.

The total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 22 + 4 = 26.

The final answer is 26."
"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of colors she had initially and then subtract the colors she used.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 x 4 = 8 colors.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 x 6 = 18 colors.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister stole one palette with 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. So, she used 6 / 2 = 3 colors.

Now, let's subtract the colors she lost and used: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we find the height of the first floor. Since the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, we multiply his height by 3.
   60 inches * 3 = 180 inches

2. Now, we find the height of the house. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, we multiply his height by 7.
   60 inches * 7 = 420 inches

3. To find the height of the roof, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.
   420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches

So, the roof is 240 inches from the second floor's floor."
"To find out how many shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found 280 shells.

700 - 280 = 420

Now, we need to find out how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we need to find out how many shells team Gogetters found. We already know that team Alphas and The finders found 280 + 252 = 532 shells. 

So, team Gogetters found 700 - 532 = 168 shells.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to add up the miles the first three dogs need and then subtract that from the total average miles they need.

The first dog needs 1 mile.
The second dog needs 4 miles.
The third dog needs 3 miles.

1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

The total miles the first three dogs need is 8 miles. 

The average miles they need is 3 miles per day. 

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to subtract the total miles the first three dogs need from the average miles.

3 - 8 = -5

Since we can't have a negative number of miles, we need to recheck our math.

Let's recheck the math:
The first dog needs 1 mile.
The second dog needs 4 miles.
The third dog needs 3 miles.

The total miles the first three dogs need is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

The average miles they need is 3 miles per day.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to subtract the total miles the first three dogs need from the average miles.

3 - 8 = -5

This is still not correct. Let's try again.

The average miles they need is 3 miles per day. 
The total number of dogs is 4. 

To find the total miles they need, we multiply the average miles by the total number of dogs.

3 * 4 = 12 miles

The total miles they need is 12 miles.

The first dog needs 1 mile.
The second dog needs 4 miles.
The third dog needs 3 miles.

The total miles the first three dogs need is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs need from the total miles they need.

12 - 8 = 4

The last dog needs 4 miles."
"To find out how much money John had leftover, we need to follow the steps:

1. Calculate 40% of the house's value: 
40% of $250,000 = 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000

2. Calculate 60% of the loan amount:
60% of $100,000 = 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000

3. Subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount:
$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John had $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.

"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we need to add up the weights of all the tunas he caught.

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
The last tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram.

Total earnings = 128 kilograms * $0.50 = $64

The answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the price she sells the magazines for. 

She bought the magazines for $72 and sells them at 11/8 of that price. 

11/8 of $72 is 11/8 * 72 = 66.

So, Trinity sells the magazines for $66. 

Her profit is the difference between the selling price and the buying price. 

Profit = Selling price - Buying price 
= 66 - 72 
= -6 

The negative sign means she is losing money."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. 
So, in 3 days, it removes 3 * 1 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. 
So, in 3 days, it removes 3 * 2 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. 
So, in 5 days, it removes 5 * 4 = 20 liters.

Now, let's add the water removed at each setting: 
3 (low) + 6 (medium) + 20 (high) = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to find the capacity of one of his classes. 

Since each class in John's school has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we multiply the capacity of Ali's class by 1/8.

Capacity of one class in John's school = 120 * 1/8 = 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15 = 30

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities. 

Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. 
2% of $300 is 0.02 x $300 = $6.

So, the total amount Stephen owes is $300 + $6 = $306.

Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. 
$25 x 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar first. 

The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the length by the width by the height. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total jelly beans = Volume / 0.8
Total jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Total jelly beans = 675

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 675 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 202.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a jelly bean, we round down to 202 red jelly beans.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so Tim's guess was 900 - 202 = 698 jelly beans off."
"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to follow the steps:

1. The bus had 20 people initially.
2. 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, so the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first station entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is 30, so 30 people entered the bus at the second station. 
   The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of people on the bus doubled. 
   The number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20.

"Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. 
She visits for 5 years, so she visits 3 * 5 = 15 times. 
The cost of one visit is $2. So, she spent 15 * 2 = $30 in the first 5 years.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. 
150% of $2 is 2 * 1.5 = $3.50. 
So, the new cost of one visit is $2 + $3.50 = $5.50.

She visits for 3 more years, so she visits 3 * 3 = 9 times. 
She spent 9 * 5.50 = $49.50 in the last 3 years.

In total, Pauline spent $30 + $49.50 = $79.50.

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can represent the length of the shorter piece as x. Then, the longer piece is 4x. 

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly made is x.
2. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies is 3x - 2.
3. Since each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.
4. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure first. 

The manicure costs $35 and the pedicure costs $40. If Karen gets both, the total cost is $35 + $40 = $75.

Since Karen wants to get nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for fingers and 5 for toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail. So, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Now, we need to calculate the 20% discount on the total cost of the manicure and pedicure. 20% of $75 is 0.2 * $75 = $15. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75. After the 20% discount, the cost is $75 - $15 = $60.

Adding the cost of nail art, the total cost is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is 90."

Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and the middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total number of books: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase. 

To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold. 

110 รท 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"To find out how many eggs Rose bought, we need to multiply the number of dozens by 12. 

5 dozens = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs

She bought 60 eggs for $2.40. 

Now, let's find out how much she will sell each egg for. 
She sells 3 eggs for $1. 
So, 1 egg will cost $1 / 3 = $0.33

Now, let's find out how much she will sell 60 eggs for. 
60 eggs * $0.33 = $20

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the selling price. 
Profit = Selling price - Cost 
Profit = $20 - $2.40 
Profit = $17.60

The final answer is: $17.60"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps:

1. Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.
2. The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.
3. 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 3/5 * 50 = 30.
4. The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

The number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost of each stick. 

$15.00 รท 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. 

$0.50 ร 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she got right on the first test.

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. 
She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. 
The total questions are 70 + 40 = 110 questions.
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test to pass.

The final answer is 35."
"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first find the number of strawberry cubes. 

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. 
The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so it is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. 
So, the number of strawberry cubes plus the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 116. 
We can write this as an equation: x + (5x - 4) = 116.

Now, let's solve the equation:
x + 5x - 4 = 116
Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116
Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120
Divide both sides by 6: x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:
Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is 96."
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she played in a year by the number of points she scored in each game, and then multiply that by the number of years.

She played 40 games per year and scored 21 points per game. 

40 games/year * 21 points/game = 840 points/year

She played for 4 years. 

840 points/year * 4 years = 3360 points

Ara has scored 3360 points in the four years."
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left. Then he found 3 more, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. He got rid of 1 bead, which isn't a marble, so he had 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to find out how many customers he needs to get 15, we divide 15 by 1 (since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls). 

15 รท 1 = 15

This means Jason needs 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Next, we know that for every 2 customers, Jason gets 1 car sold. So, to find out how many customers he needs to get 15 cars, we divide 15 by 2.

15 รท 2 = 7.5

Since we can't have half a customer, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't sell half a car, so we need to find the smallest whole number of customers that will give us at least 15 cars. 

To do this, we can multiply 7.5 by 2 to get 15. 

7.5 * 2 = 15

So, Jason needs 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Now, we know that for every 25 calls, Jason gets 1 customer. To find out how many calls he needs to make to get 15 customers, we divide 15 by 1.

15 รท 1 = 15

So, Jason needs 15 * 25 = 375 calls to get 15 customers.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find the total number of flashlights, we need to multiply the number of people by 2. 
There are 4 people, so they have 4 x 2 = 8 flashlights.

To find the total number of candles, we need to know how many rooms have small candles and how many have medium candles. 
There are 8 rooms in total, so half of them will have small candles and the other half will have medium candles. 
Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have small candles and 4 rooms have medium candles.

For the 4 rooms with small candles, there are 4 x 4 = 16 small candles.
For the 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 4 x 5 = 20 medium candles.

Now, we add the total number of small and medium candles together. 
16 + 20 = 36 candles.

So, Brianna's family is using 8 flashlights and 36 candles when the lights go out."
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. 

There are 2 bags of chips with 55 chips in each bag.

110 chips / 5 family members = 22 chips per person.

The answer is 22."
"To find the total time, we need to add up the time it takes to get to each side.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides take twice as long, so each takes 5 x 2 = 10 minutes.
The last two sides take half as long as the first, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 30 minutes."
"To find the total number of items, we need to know the number of robots. 

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, we can find the number of robots by dividing 20 by 2. 

20 / 2 = 10

Now, we know there are 10 robots. 

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, we can find the number of footballs by multiplying 20 by 2. 

20 * 2 = 40

Now we know there are 40 footballs. 

To find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together. 

10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with, we need to first find out how many minutes he works in a week. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and he works 6 hours a day. So, he works 6 * 60 = 360 minutes a day. 

Since he works 5 days a week, he works 360 * 5 = 1800 minutes a week.

It takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. So, the number of calls he deals with in a week is 1800 / 15 = 120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish to dry with the new varnish, we need to first find out how long it would take with the old varnish. 

Since it takes 7 minutes for the old varnish to dry on one painting, it will take 7 minutes for 6 paintings. 
6 x 7 = 42 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings. 
It takes 12 minutes for the new varnish to dry on one painting, so it will take 12 minutes for 6 paintings. 
6 x 12 = 72 minutes

To find out how much longer it will take, we need to subtract the time it takes with the old varnish from the time it takes with the new varnish. 
72 - 42 = 30 minutes

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the water for each group of plants.

4 plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

8 plants need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

The rest of the plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so that's 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add up all the water: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to cover half the distance on land and half the distance in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and half is in water, Phineas will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time on land = Distance / Speed
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance / Speed
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to know the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since there are 4 additional phones and each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 x $20 = $40.

The total cost of the additional phones is 4 x $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $160 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in June, we need to know how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day. Since 1 dozen is 12, Derrick makes 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

In 30 days, Derrick makes 120 x 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. So, he makes 3600 x $2 = $7200 in June."

"To find the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed. 

His original speed is 150 words per minute. 
His new speed is 2.5 times faster than his original speed. 
So, his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 words per minute.

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. 
Each page has 450 words. 
So, 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we can find the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute. 
Time = Total words / Speed 
Time = 4500 / 375 
Time = 12 minutes.

The answer is 12."
"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach.
- On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.
- On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so there were 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, let's calculate the number of people Conor saw on the rest of the week (4 days). Since he saw an average of 60 people each day, the total number of people on those days is 60 * 4 = 240.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw that week:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week) = 400

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 190 kernels.

2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 2-legged animals have 10 x 2 = 20 legs. 
4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 4-legged animals have 15 x 4 = 60 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Since each pair of legs belongs to one animal, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs. 
80 / 2 = 40 pairs of legs.

Distance = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph.
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 18 x 8
Distance = 144 miles

Now, we need to add the distances together to find the total distance Elvis traveled.
Total Distance = 90 + 144
Total Distance = 234 miles

Since Elvis traveled 234 miles in total, and he traveled 90 miles west and 144 miles east, we need to find the distance from his house. 
To do this, we need to subtract the distance he traveled west from the total distance.

Now, let's add them together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to know the age of the older brother. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that's half the age of the older brother, we can find the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now we know the older brother is 24 years old. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of all the siblings. 

The 2 brothers are 12 and 24 years old. 
The 3 sisters are 16 years old each. 

Total age of brothers = 12 + 24 = 36
Total age of sisters = 3 * 16 = 48

Total age of all siblings = 36 + 48 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time Charisma spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time she spent on each activity separately.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 minutes per day. 

She does this for 7 days a week, so that's 30 * 7 = 210 minutes per week.

She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week.

In 4 weeks, she meditates 210 * 4 = 840 minutes and practices yoga 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

So, the total time she spent on meditation and yoga is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric, we need to calculate the area of each type of shirt and add them together.

The area of the small shirts is 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
The area of the medium shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The quilt will be 101 square feet."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to first find out how many seeds are in a small sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 x 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5. 36 x 0.5 = 18.

Now, we add the seeds of the small sunflower and the extra seeds in the large sunflower. 36 + 18 = 54.

So, there are 54 sunflower seeds altogether.

54"
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to follow the information given. 

George has 18 pens. 
Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, so Timothy has 3 x 18 = 54 pens. 
Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so Sarah has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Albert is 36"" tall.
2. Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne is 2 x 36"" = 72"".
3. Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".
4. Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so before summer, Jackie was 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

The final answer is: 67"
"To find out how much money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, we need to multiply this number by 14 (the number of days in two weeks).

5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

The company sells each bar for $2. So, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar:

70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

The company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.

Cost of the first T-shirt: $8
Cost of the second T-shirt: $8 * 0.5 = $4
Total cost of T-shirts: $8 + $4 = $12

For the shoes:
The original price of the shoes is $40. The shoes are 40% off, so Jake pays 60% of the original price.

Cost of the shoes: $40 * 0.6 = $24

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends.

Total amount spent: $12 + $24 = $36

The final answer is: 36"
"Ryan gets $6 each week for doing his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he got 6 * 3 = 18 dollars.

He spent $1.25 on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he spent 1.25 * 4 = 5 dollars.

Now he has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.

The movie tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide 13 by 6.5. 

13 รท 6.5 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find out how much they spent in total, we need to add up the cost of all the things they bought.

Ellen bought leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, Lani spent $30 + $100 + $100 = $230.

Now, let's add up the money they spent. Ellen spent $105 and Lani spent $230. $105 + $230 = $335.

So, they spent $335 in total."
"To find the total cost of making one jar, we need to add the cost of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey. 

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's find the profit for one jar: 
Profit per jar = Selling price - Total cost
Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit for 10 jars: 
Total profit = Profit per jar * Number of jars
Total profit = $6 * 10
Total profit = $60

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total dollar amount, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x 25 = 800 cents.
A dime is worth 10 cents, so 95 dimes are worth 95 x 10 = 950 cents.
A nickel is worth 5 cents, so 120 nickels are worth 120 x 5 = 600 cents.
A penny is worth 1 cent, so 750 pennies are worth 750 x 1 = 750 cents.

Now, let's add all the values together:
800 + 950 + 600 + 750 = 3100 cents

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 3100 cents to dollars by dividing by 100:
3100 รท 100 = 31

The total dollar amount in the jar is 31 dollars."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to add up the money she spent and subtract it from the money her parents gave her.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 for a movie ticket, and $8.50 on a bracelet. 
So, the total money she spent is $3.50 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $19.50.

Janet's parents gave her $40. 
To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the money she spent from the money her parents gave her: $40 - $19.50 = $20.50.

Janet has $20.50 left.

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to first find out how many days he is open in 2 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week. Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). 

In 2 weeks, he will be open 2 x 6 = 12 days.

Josh services 3 cars a day. So, in 12 days, he will service 12 x 3 = 36 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car. So, for 36 cars, he will get 36 x $4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's count the cookies Randy has:

- He started with 9 oatmeal cookies, ate 3, and then 2 more for lunch, so he has 9 - 3 - 2 = 4 oatmeal cookies left.
- He started with 4 chocolate chip cookies, ate 1, so he has 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies left.
- He started with 5 sugar cookies, gave 2 away, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 sugar cookies left.

Then, he baked 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
- 4 oatmeal cookies (he already had 4)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (he already had 3)
- 3 sugar cookies (he already had 3)

In total, Randy now has 4 + 3 + 3 = 10 cookies."
"To find out how much Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the total amount for each half of the collection.

Half of 12 is 6. 

For the first half (6 toys), Matthew would sell them for $5 each. 
6 x $5 = $30

For the second half (6 toys), Matthew would sell them for $7 each. 
6 x $7 = $42

Now, we need to add the amounts from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn. 
$30 + $42 = $72

The final answer is 72."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many holes Nate's dog dug in 14 days. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day, so in 14 days, it will dig 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Then, Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, Nate needs to fill in 9 + 6 = 15 holes a day.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes. We have 84 holes to fill in, and Nate fills in 15 holes a day. 

To find the number of days, we divide 84 by 15. 84 / 15 = 5.6 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, it will take Nate 6 days to fill in all the holes.

Now, we need to convert the days into weeks. There are 7 days in a week. 

6 days / 7 days per week = 0.86 weeks.

Since we can't have a fraction of a week, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, it will take Nate 1 week to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 1"
"To find the difference in enrollment, we need to first find the number of students at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we multiply 4000 by 3/4. 

3/4 * 4000 = 3000

Now, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School to find the difference.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

First, let's subtract the rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:
7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

The final answer is: 2325"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. 

Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

He gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

He gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7.

Now, let's add up the items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 16 Petri dishes = 31 items.

However, the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29. This means he lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to first find out how many screws he will use. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for 4 tables is 4 x 4 = 16.

James has 40 screws. He will use 16 screws. 

To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract 16 from 40. 

40 - 16 = 24

James will have 24 screws left over."
"To find the answer, we need to know how many eggs are in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

10 eggs in the first basket * 2 = 20 eggs in the second basket

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets together.

10 eggs + 20 eggs = 30 eggs

The answer is 30."
"To find the total amount of money they raised, we need to add up the money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add up the money they raised:
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, we need to find out how long it would take Aaron to run 2 miles (half of 4 miles) to compare their times.

We know Aaron completed 2 miles in 16 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to run 1 mile, we divide 16 by 2, which is 8 minutes.

Now, since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, it will take her twice as long to run 2 miles. So, we multiply 8 minutes by 2, which is 16 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs, we need to multiply the number of feet of dock by 3.

The caretaker has 200 feet of dock and wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. 

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

He already has 6 feet of line. 

600 - 6 = 594

So, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount they make in a day and then multiply it by 2.

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation has 2 meals and a bottle of wine. 

The cost of 2 meals is 2 x $5 = $10. 
Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total amount they make in a night is 6 x $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total amount they make in a week is 2 x $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons. 

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we need to find 25% of the total cost. 

25% of $80 is 0.25 x $80 = $20. 

So, the total selling price of all the watermelons is $80 + $20 = $100. 

To find the price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons. 

$100 รท 50 = $2. 

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old James is now and then find out how old John's youngest son is.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so now she is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. So, John is 18 - 19 = -1 years old now. But that can't be true, so we need to go back to the beginning. John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. So, John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to know how many oranges each person peels per minute. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so she peels 1/3 orange per minute. 
Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so she peels 1/4 orange per minute.

In 1 hour, there are 60 minutes. 
Ana peels 1/3 * 60 = 20 oranges in 1 hour. 
Jane peels 1/4 * 60 = 15 oranges in 1 hour.

Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane in 1 hour."
"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price. 

80% of $400 is 0.8 x $400 = $320. 

So, Mark paid $320 for the radiator.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the installation. 

The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours. 

$50 x 3 = $150.

So, the total cost is $320 (radiator) + $150 (installation) = $470.

The final answer is 470."
"To solve this problem, we need to know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. So, we can write an equation:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.
