"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she has left after eating and baking.

She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh initially put in $50,000 for repairs. 

The profit is the new value minus the initial investment: $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs per week is 180."
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to add the feed given in the morning and afternoon.

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups
Total feed so far: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed, we can multiply the total feed by the number of chickens to find the total amount of feed needed for the day.

Total feed needed: 40 cups * 20 chickens = 800 cups

Since Wendi already gave 40 cups of feed, she needs to give the remaining amount in the final meal.

Final meal feed: 800 cups - 40 cups = 760 cups

The final answer is: 760"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * 0.6 * $5 = $13.50.
The total cost is $5 + $13.50 = $18.50.

The final answer is: $18.50"
"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 40% of the file, which is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. This takes 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Then, the download is interrupted and restarted. The second download also takes 40 minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes + 40 minutes = 80 minutes.

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to break it down into three parts:

1. The first 3 hours at 60 mph: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. The 2 hours in standstill traffic: 
Since he didn't move, the distance is 0 miles.

3. The half-hour at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. The remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

Now, we add up the distances:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

So, John is 355 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings are:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

Month 1: 60 downloads
Month 2: 3 times the downloads of Month 1 = 3 * 60 = 180 downloads
Month 3: 30% of Month 2 downloads = 0.3 * 180 = 54 downloads
Month 3 downloads reduced by 30% from Month 2, so we subtract 30% of Month 2 from Month 2 downloads: 
Month 3 downloads = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Now, we add the downloads for all three months:
Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads

366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even (cover the initial cost), we need to find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90.

$90 / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - x/3 - 2 - (2x - x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/3 + x/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms again:

x - 2x/3 - 3 = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3x - 2x - 9 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 9 = 15

Add 9 to both sides:

x = 24

So Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.
25% of the remaining students (16 students) = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

Total students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance = 4 + 4 = 8 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = Total students - students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance = 20 - 8 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles on the first day. 

On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since they traveled the same distance, each train covered 150 miles northward.

The total distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 + 150 = 230 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, let's multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4 to find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert 84 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to complete the 12-mile trail.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to complete the remaining 8 miles.

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the remaining time.

Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
Required speed = 8 miles / 1 hour
Required speed = 8 miles per hour

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 49/3 - 1 = 48/3 = 16 liters.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's age when his son was born. 

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know Raymond's age when his son was born (23 years old) and his current age (25 years old). To find the difference between his current age and the age when his son was born, we subtract 23 from 25:

25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75% = 0.75).

Original price = Discounted price / 0.75
Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162
Combine like terms: 18x = 162
Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages:
Darrell's age: 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age: 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now: 99 + 10 = 109

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add the guesses and divide by 3: 
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x is the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is 70."

"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 = $35.

Since he spent $35 on video games, he must have had $35 + $5 = $40 initially.

Now, we know he had $40 initially and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, we know he had 13 Lego sets initially. The question asks how many Lego sets he still has, but the information given doesn't provide any information about the number of Lego sets he has left."
"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
- He runs 3 hours on the first day, so the distance covered is 60 miles.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per day.
- Total distance covered on the other two days is 30 * 2 = 60 miles.
- Total distance covered in a week is 60 + 60 = 120 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends running:
- He runs 3 hours on the first day.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.
- Total time spent running on the other two days is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours.
- Total time spent running in a week is 3 + 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate his running speed:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 120 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 20 miles per hour.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
Number of candles made = 20
Price per candle = $2.00
Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
Number of pounds of beeswax and wicks needed = 20 candles / 10 candles per pound
Number of pounds of beeswax and wicks needed = 2 pounds
Cost per pound = $10.00
Total cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes an average of 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

= 277

The final answer is: 277"
"To find out how many blue ties John bought, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties ($200) by the cost of each blue tie ($40). 

200 / 40 = 5 blue ties

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, which means it's 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie. 

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * $40 = $60

Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

Total amount spent on ties = $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800

The final answer is: 800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he is sailing from 1 to 4 PM, that's 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds from the toys.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find out how many toys he needs to remove by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total earnings for Thursday and Friday separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The total revenue for truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360.
The total revenue for car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue for Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The total revenue for car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue for Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue for each day. 
$520 (Thursday) is greater than $480 (Friday), so Thursday has higher revenue.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue of Friday from the revenue of Thursday.
$520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

Remaining money: $42 - $14 = $28

Now, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a ticket to find out how many times he can go to the movies:
$28 ÷ $7 = 4

So, Peter can go to the movies 4 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the tip of $4.00 to the total fees, making it $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Finally, we add the original bill of $40.00 to the total fees, resulting in a final total of $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000. 

5% of $50,000 is 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500.

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $2,500.

To find the total annual pension, we add the two amounts: $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount she paid for the first half is:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so the amount she paid for the second half is:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the second half is:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first half and the second half to get the total amount she paid for the year:

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used for the last fill-up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used for the last fill-up (4 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we can multiply the miles per gallon by the remaining gallons in the tank (3 gallons) to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank.

25 miles per gallon × 3 gallons = 75 miles

So, Sophia can drive 75 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs it in 38 seconds, we can set up an equation to find Gerald's original time. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as x. Then, we can write the equation as: 
x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:
x = 36

Now that we know Gerald's original time, we can calculate his improved time. Since his speed improved by 10%, we can multiply his original time by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement):
Gerald's improved time = 1.1 * 36
Gerald's improved time = 39.6

The final answer is 39.6."
"To find the total number of pets, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 
Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference.

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, we can multiply 32 by 2 to get the total volume of the tomatoes. 

32 * 2 = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide 64 by 16 to find out how many cans of tomatoes she used.

64 / 16 = 4

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply 4 by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

4 * 3 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

First, let's find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total. We know that 5 cars took an exit, and there were originally 30 cars. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to calculate the total number of plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she will give away.

Mary initially has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 
So, the total number of plants she has is: 
18 (new plants) + (2 * 40) (plants on the ledges) = 18 + 80 = 98

She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. 
So, the number of plants she will have left is: 
98 - 40 = 58

Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total number of pages:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Since Solo has 4 more days to complete the reading, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). 
So, the total number of glasses of water on weekdays is 5 * 1 = 5.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks 1 glass of water per day, so the total number of glasses of water on weekends is 2 * 1 = 2.

Now, we add the total number of glasses of water on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week.
Total glasses of water in a week = 5 (weekdays) + 2 (weekends) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 
Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find out how many pieces Poppy has placed, we first need to find out how many pieces she started with. Since she placed a quarter of the 1000 pieces, we calculate that as 1000 * 0.25 = 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. The remaining pieces after Poppy's initial placement would be 1000 - 250 = 750.

A third of 750 is 750 * 0.33 = 247.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a piece, we'll round down to 247 pieces.

Now, we subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces: 750 - 247 = 503.

The answer is 503."
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

"To find the inner volume of the boxes, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the outer dimensions.

The outer dimensions are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting the wall thickness of 1 inch from each dimension, we get:

Inner length: 5 - 1 = 4 inches
Inner width: 6 - 1 = 5 inches
Inner height: 4 - 1 = 3 inches

Now, we multiply the inner dimensions to find the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume = length * width * height = 4 * 5 * 3 = 60 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 60 * 3 = 180 cubic inches

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he watched on other days and subtract that from the total time he watched.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, we subtract the time watched on other days from the total time: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can divide 1.5 hours by 0.5 to find the number of episodes: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average.

Average number of roll-ups eaten: 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. 

Since Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can find the rate of feet per second: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Now, we can find the total number of sets of 10 feet Julia rowed: 64 feet / 10 feet per set = 6.4 sets.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we multiply the number of sets by 2: 6.4 sets * 2 liters per set = 12.8 liters.

The final answer is: 12.8"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

"To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to divide the total number of photographs his phone can hold by 6, since his phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.

First, we need to find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we divide 1800 by 6 to get the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. To find the number of ducks, we divide the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by 50.

300 / 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, add the total costs of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Now, calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
10 boards * $15 per board = $150

Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 
5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Add the total revenue from both types of boards: 
$150 + $120 = $270

The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by 7 to find the value of one part: 
120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts of sugar in the ratio: 
17.14 * 7 = 120.98 

Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
Katy used approximately 120 teaspoons of sugar."

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day.

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary. 

30% of $40000 is 0.3 * 40000 = $12000. 
Adrien's current salary is $40000 + $12000 = $52000.

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation: 
Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary. 
40% of $30769.23 is 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary is $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

"To find the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters were stamped. 

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate the number of letters stamped as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters stamped = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. To find the initial number of letters in the pile, we can subtract the number of letters stamped from the current number of letters in the pile:

Initial number of letters in the pile = Current number of letters in the pile - Number of letters stamped

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, we add the questions completed in both tests: 
40 questions + 30 questions = 70 questions

Since the total number of questions in the first test was 75, we subtract the questions completed from the total to find the questions left incomplete: 
75 questions - 70 questions = 5 questions

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs by 4 and then add 22.

Number of blue gumballs = 12
Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22

= 70

The number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To find the number of worker bees, we need to first find the number of queens and then the number of baby bees. 

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. The sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is equal to 700. 

So, we can write the equation: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would work 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, his total earnings in a week would be 14 * $10 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the tax on non-food items first. The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. 

The total cost of non-food items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.
The tax on non-food items is 10 * 0.10 = 1 dollar.

Now, let's add the cost of food items (milk and eggs) to the total cost of non-food items and the tax.
The total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.
The total cost of everything is 10 + 1 + 5 = 16 dollars.

"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need. He has 3 clients, and each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. So, he will need 3 * 2 = 6 bottles of bleach and 3 packs of cloths.

The total cost of bleach will be 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of cloths will be 3 * $5 = $15.

The total expenses will be $12 + $15 = $27.

Since Kim's total income is $92, his profit will be $92 - $27 = $65.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field and then divide it by the number of harvests he can make in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples in the field:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

"To find the total number of legos, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the total number of pieces: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the first 30 leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
5. Since 30 bees had already left, the total number of bees that leave in the next 6 hours is 60 - 30 = 30 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 45 bees had already returned, 30 bees (60 - 30) return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, Debra sees 30 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets first. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets minus the change. 

$22 (total cost) - $8 (change) = $14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of friends James has, we need to first find out how many friends Dorothy has. 

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can divide 12 by 3 to find out how many friends Dorothy has: 
12 / 3 = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can multiply this number by 4 to find out how many friends James has: 
4 * 4 = 16

James has 16 friends on Facebook."
"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The seagull ate 7 fries, so the remaining fries are 14 - 7 = 7.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total.
5. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are 7 - 9 = -2. However, since we can't have negative fries, we need to re-evaluate the previous steps.
   Let's re-evaluate step 3. The seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 9 fries, but the problem states that the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, and the pigeons ate 3 fries each. So, the correct calculation for the pigeons eating 3 fries each is 3 * 3 = 9 fries, but this is not the correct amount of fries the pigeons ate. Since the seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 3 fries each, the correct amount of fries the pigeons ate is 3 * 3 = 9 fries, but this is not the correct amount of fries the pigeons ate.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In a week, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours attending classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 17 * 16 = 272 hours attending classes in a semester.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12: 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.
Converting the total length of the croissants to feet: 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, let's add the total lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet.

"To determine the winner, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs 15 times back and forth on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, he covers the entire 100 yards twice for each run. So, the total distance Blake runs is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Since she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 40 yards twice for each run. So, the total distance Kelly runs is 34 * 2 * 40 = 2720 yards.

Since 3000 yards is greater than 2720 yards, Blake wins the contest. 

The difference in distance between the winner and the loser is 3000 - 2720 = 280 yards.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. 
To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3, which is (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Price after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Price after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

Increase after 28 months = 20% of $213.96 = 0.20 * $213.96 = $42.79
Price after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 = $256.75

Increase after 30 months = 20% of $256.75 = 0.20 * $256.75 = $51.55
Price after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.55 = $308.30

Increase after 32 months = 20% of $308.30 = 0.20 * $308.30 = $61.66
Price after 32 months = $308.30 + $61.66 = $369.96

Increase after 34 months = 20% of $369.96 = 0.20 * $369.96 = $73.99
Price after 34 months = $369.96 + $73.99 = $443.95

Increase after 36 months = 20% of $443.95 = 0.20 * $443.95 = $88.79
Price after 36 months = $443.95 + $88.79 = $532.74

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $532.74."
"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others. 

Since one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can calculate the cost of an action figure as follows:
3 action figures = 1 doll = $4
1 action figure = $4 / 3
1 action figure = $1.33

Now, we know the cost of an action figure. We also know the cost of a red car, which is $4.

The total cost of all toys is the sum of the costs of each item:
5 red cars = 5 * $4 = $20
3 action figures = 3 * $1.33 = $4
1 doll = $4

Total cost = $20 + $4 + $4 = $28

The final answer is: 28"
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Sandra needs to babysit 5 times."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. 

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2, respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B: S = 2 * 8 = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, let's add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

The total cost of each uniform is $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: 
- Sally Four: 8 years old
- Sally Two: 19 years old
- Granny Red: 16 years old
- Sally Thirty-two: 8 years old

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 51 years."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, and the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Then, the number of red roses is 4x, and the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of red roses by multiplying x by 4: 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Sandra needs 160 red roses to be delivered by 5 pm to keep her business."

We know Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal.

For the sandwiches, he ate 2 slices per day for 7 days, so 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

For the omelets, he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich, so he used 3 slices per omelet. He ate 3 omelets for 3 days, so 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

For the macaroni and cheese, he used 8 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each type of bag and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of pens in the blue bags:
6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of pens in the red bags:
2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add the number of pens Janet already had to the number of pens in the blue and red bags:
22 green pens + 54 blue pens + 10 yellow pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the average of the six tests, we need to first find the total score of the first five tests. 

Total score of the first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

Total score of the first five tests without the lowest score = 438 - 71 = 367

To get an average of 93, the total score of the six tests should be 93 * 6 = 558.

So, the score Brinley needs on the sixth test = 558 - 367 = 191.

The final answer is 191."
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

The final answer is: 76"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups.
   Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $5, which is 12 sessions.

To find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $4, which is 15 sessions.

Since she can earn $60 in 12 babysitting sessions, she can afford the jacket and shoes in 12 sessions. However, she needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn the same amount."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs collected is 3r + 5w.

We are given that the total number of eggs collected is 42. So, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can calculate the time Gary spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool has lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water in the last 4 minutes. The big pool has also lost 16 gallons of water in the last 4 minutes.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay, we first need to calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, which is 10% of $2000. 

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since she will be paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months:

$165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

Janeth's remaining balance will be $220."

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is 40 - 8 = 32.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, the total number of cards is 90 - 8 + 14 = 96.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final answer is 33."
"To find the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The base burrito is $6.50.
Extra meat is $2.00.
Extra cheese is $1.00.
Avocado is $1.00.
2 sauces are $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The upgrade is $3.00.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $0.50 = $10.00
$10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:
$13.00 - $5.00 = $8.00

Chad still owes $8.00."
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide 360 by 6 to find the total minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

60 / 60 = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially, we need to calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready. To find out how many watermelons were remaining, we need to subtract the initial number of harvested watermelons from the total.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested, we subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000

The tax: 10% of $240,000 = 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000

The registration fees: 12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000

The total cost: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to know that there are half as many bugs as ants. Since there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of ants and bugs. 
Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to first calculate how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jump in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

So, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins leave the sunbathing area.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

12"
"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide 42 by 3 to get the number of vines needed.

42 / 3 = 14

So, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens.

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A:
   1000 - 300 = 700 students

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
   3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:
   700 - 420 = 280 students

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has. 

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find Robert's candies. 
Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can add 6 to Robert's candies to find James' candies.
James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we can find out how many more candies John has than James by subtracting James' candies from John's candies.
John's candies - James' candies = 54 - 33
John's candies - James' candies = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to add the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read 2 + 2 = 4 books in total.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read 1 + 1 = 2 books in total.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he sends and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, and he sends 6 letters per week. So, he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to convert the total number of pages to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can divide the total number of pages by 60 to get the total number of minutes.

30 pages / 60 minutes per page = 0.5 hours per week.

The final answer is: 0.5"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for these calls would be:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used would be:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left for the month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Total hours worked per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total cost without discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Discount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as follows:

Total number of students = 1.5 classes * 20 students/class
= 30 students

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in these two classes is:

15 + 12 = 27 girls

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:

30 - 27 = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. We know that the first and second classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls, so the number of boys in these two classes is:

30 - 27 = 3 boys

Since there are 3 classes, the number of boys in the third class is:

3 boys / 2 classes = 1.5 boys

Since we can't have a fraction of a boy, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that the 1.5 boys could be 1 boy and 1.5 students who are not boys (but this is not possible since the school is 50% boys). Therefore, we can conclude that the third class has 1 boy."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals Rick killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to find the total weight:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of the total weight:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.
The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song.

The song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4 / 5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 = (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards
2. Calculate the remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter A: 80 - 32 = 48 cards
3. Calculate the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. Calculate the remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter B: 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Calculate the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards
6. Calculate the number of cards with the letter D: 24 - 15 = 9 cards

The number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. However, the problem doesn't provide that information. 

Let's assume their current ages are x and y. We know that x + y = 20. 

In 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 20 + 20 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately.

The cost of the popsicles: 20 popsicles * $0.25 = $5
The cost of the ice cream bars: 4 ice cream bars * $0.50 = $2

Now, let's add the costs together: $5 + $2 = $7

So, Peter paid a total of $7."
"To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 15 * 2 = 30. 

The total number of people attending the soccer game is 15 (team members and coaches) + 30 (guests) = 45.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, Maddy will need 45 / 3 = 15 pizzas.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so Maddy will spend 15 * 15 = $225.

225"
"To find the total length of the space between the gemstones, we need to subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace. 

There are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, so the total length of the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length of the gemstones from the total length, we get 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to divide the remaining space by 0.25 to find the number of beads. 

17 / 0.25 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in the second week: 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we need to add the stories from the first and second week: 20 + 40 + 60 + 80 + 120 = 280 stories.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 
Ann's brother's current age = 9 * 2 = 18 years.

Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The cost of the pop is 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 
To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 8. 

The answer is 8."
"To find the total weight of 80 flagstones, we need to multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone.

Total weight = 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
= 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds
= 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have in total. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. 

So, 39 = 10 * x / 10. 

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 10. 

39 * 10 = 10 * x 
390 = 10x 

Now, divide both sides by 10. 

390 / 10 = x 
x = 39 

The final answer is 39."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so there are 4 + 8 = 12 people in total. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16. These are to be shared equally among the children. 

There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she worked.

She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she worked for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she paused for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she worked. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the points of each player, we need to calculate their points before the extra points.

Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check if they have over 20 points to get the extra point in the fourth round.
- Mike has 21 points, so yes.
- Jim has 18 points, so no.
- Tony has 42 points, so yes.

Since they all get an extra point, their new points are:
- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim: 18 + 0 = 18 points
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add up their points to find the total.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The rice will last for 3 weeks."

"To find the total distance driven per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year. 

Since John goes to work and back each day, the total distance driven per day is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. 

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles. 

Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving. He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Additionally, he gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500. Adding $700 to that makes the flight ticket cost $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can calculate Noah's age six years ago as follows:
   Noah's age six years ago = Cera's age six years ago
   Since Cera is 46 years old now, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old six years ago.
   Noah's age six years ago = 40

2. Now, we can calculate Noah's current age:
   Noah's current age = Noah's age six years ago + 6
   Noah's current age = 40 + 6
   Noah's current age = 46

3. Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can calculate the population of Chile six years ago:
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 40
   Population of Chile six years ago = 120000

4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, we can calculate the current population of Chile:
   Population of Chile now = 2 * Population of Chile six years ago
   Population of Chile now = 2 * 120000
   Population of Chile now = 240000

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."

Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the beginning, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information:

1. The magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4. 
   So, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine.
   So, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, but we don't know how many pencils are in each box. Let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. 

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46. 

We know that the total number of pencils is 26. 

So, we can set up the equation: 3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Combine the constants: 3x + 48 = 26

Subtract 48 from both sides: 3x = -22

Divide both sides by 3: x = -22/3

Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, this doesn't make sense. However, let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and the total number of pencils is 26. 

So, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 26 - 2 = 24. 

Since there are 3 boxes, we can divide 24 by 3 to find the number of pencils in each box: 24/3 = 8.

Now, we know that each box has 8 pencils. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 8 + 2 = 26.

Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 26 + 46 = 72.

Now, we need to find the number of boxes needed to store 72 pencils. 

Since each box has 8 pencils, we can divide 72 by 8 to find the number of boxes: 72/8 = 9.

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To find the total weakening of the coffee, we need to calculate the weakening caused by the cooling and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

The added cream makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got in total. Since they left with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for each new one, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in.

Since they got 7 new records, and each new record was obtained by trading 2 old records, we multiply the number of new records by 2.

7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of 100. 

2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to find the salary of a senior programmer. 

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we need to find the total number of senior programmers. Since there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total number of programmers is 100. 
The total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80000
The total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144000

The total amount paid to all the programmers per month = $80000 + $144000 = $184000."
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's find the total number of people who got on the bus at the first and second stops. 
5 people got on at the first stop and 8 people got on at the second stop. 
So, 5 + 8 = 13 people got on the bus at the first and second stops.

Now, we subtract the people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 
20 people were heading to the third stop, and 7 people got off at the second stop. 
20 - 7 = 13

Since we already know that 13 people got on at the first and second stops, we can conclude that 13 people got on the bus at the terminal."
"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, let's break down the events:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

Oscar has 31 lollipops."
"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes = 40 / 1 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so now Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since $80 is 4 times $20, they got 4 rewards. 

The rewards are $1 off for every $20, so 4 rewards would be 4 * $1 = $4 off.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off.

Now, we subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the total amount spent: $80 - $4 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To calculate the net pay for Job A, we need to first calculate the total income and then subtract the taxes.

Total income for Job A: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
Total tax for Job A: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

To calculate the net pay for Job B, we need to first calculate the net income after property tax, then apply the tax rate.

Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Net pay for Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B has a higher net pay rate.

To find the difference in net pay, subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: 8400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220 and then divide that by 2.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
New value of each share after the first year: $8 + $4 = $12

Decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New value of each share after the second year: $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is: 8 * $9 = $72

Final value of all Maria's shares: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to calculate the amount Thomas ate first. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Then, John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the amount Luke ate from the amount John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. 

Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students. 

We are given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. So, we can set up the equation:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

So, the smallest group has 105 students.

105"
"To find the number of chickens and cows, we know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as 'x'. Then the number of chickens will be 2x.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. 

The total number of legs is (2 * 40) + (4 * 20) = 80 + 80 = 160.

7 - 1 = 6 balls."
"To find the weight of the yellow snake, we know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and the pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. 

So, the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

The container weighs 20 pounds. 

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.

The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

She also wants to buy $5 in arcade tokens.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget.

$90 (budget) - $30 (total cost) = $60

Since each friend will cost $0 (assuming she doesn't charge her friends for the activities), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend.

$60 / $0 = $60

Since you can't invite a fraction of a friend, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

Morgan can invite 60 friends."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4

Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

"To find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs, we need to calculate the total cost of the gumballs. 

Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is half of the initial $10. So, he had $10 / 2 = $5 left.

Now, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs and had $5 left. This means he spent $5 + $2 = $7 in total.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the total amount spent ($7) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find out how many pounds of candy he bought. 

$7 / $1.5 = 4.67 pounds.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled per day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it travels per day by the distance it travels between services. 

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more logical to consider the train's service interval in terms of the number of days it travels before needing service, so we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

So, the train goes between services approximately 38 days."

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home.

Distance to friend's house: 200 miles
Detour: 10 miles
Total distance to friend's house: 200 + 10 = 210 miles

Distance back home: 240 miles

Total distance traveled: 210 + 240 = 450 miles

To find the time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

Time taken to reach friend's house: Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours
Time taken for detour: 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours
Time taken to return home: 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken: 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

The trip took approximately 5 hours and 59 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   This means 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   This means 3 * 7 = 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. The total number of people kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence over goods on sale is 7 + 21 = 28.
5. Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 28 = 22.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin had 3x points before. 
We know Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 
To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3 = 4.67. 

So Sara had 4.67 points before. 
Since Erin had 3 times more points than Sara, Erin had 3 * 4.67 = 14 points before."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts.

1. Picture frames: 
   Each frame costs $20, and 20% of that is $4. 
   So, the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Etching the logo: 
   Since 20% of the picture frames need to be etched, that's 20% of 44, which is 0.20 * 44 = 8.8. 
   Since you can't have a fraction of a frame, we'll round down to 8 frames. 
   The cost for etching the logo is 8 * $4 = $32.

3. Pins: 
   2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. 
   The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

4. Cords for officers: 
   1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 * 0.25 = 11. 
   The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
$1056 (picture frames) + $32 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1210.

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1210."

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares. 

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

We can set up the equation as follows: 
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find out how much Tim saves, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but since he's bundling them, he gets a 20% discount. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

So, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable subscription and getting streaming services."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

"To find out how many slices Jenny has initially, we need to add the fractions 1/3 and 1/4. 

First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 3 and 4, which is 12. 

Now, we convert both fractions to have the same denominator:
1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, we can convert this to a decimal or find the whole number equivalent. 

7/12 is approximately 0.583, or 5 whole slices and 7/12 of a slice.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract 2 from 5 whole slices:
5 - 2 = 3

Now, we need to add the remaining 7/12 to 3. To do this, we convert 3 to a fraction with the same denominator (12):
3 = 36/12

Now, we add the fractions:
36/12 + 7/12 = 43/12

To convert 43/12 to a whole number, we divide 43 by 12:
43 ÷ 12 = 3.583

So, there are approximately 3.583 slices left."

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used in 30 days at the original usage rate.

Original energy usage per day: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)
Total energy usage in 30 days: 7200 Wh * 30 = 216,000 Wh

Now, let's calculate the new energy usage per day after reducing the time by 5 hours:
New energy usage per day: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

Total energy usage in 30 days at the new rate: 2700 Wh * 30 = 81,000 Wh

To find the energy saved, subtract the new total from the original total:
Energy saved in 30 days: 216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh), divide by 1000:
135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh

"To find the total number of stripes, we need to add the number of stripes on each zebra. 

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 x 17 = 34 stripes. 
Adding the zebra with 36 stripes, we have 34 + 36 = 70 stripes. 
The last zebra has half the number of stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes. 
Now, we add the stripes of all zebras: 70 + 18 = 88 stripes.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras. There are 4 zebras. 
88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22.

"To determine the total amount of meat and cheese needed, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches required. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we divide 20 by 4 to get 5 sandwiches.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
The cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of taffy at $3 per pound is 2 x $3 = $6. Since the second pound is 1/2 off, the cost of the second pound is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So the total cost of the taffy is $6 + $1.50 = $7.50.

The cost of the mixed bag of seashells is $1.50. The cost of the 4 magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $10.

Sally started with $10 and spent $10, so she has $0 left.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks first.

The first package costs $400.
The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.
The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packages. 
20% of $1200 is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.
The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, calculate 5% of 50,000 candles:
5% of 50,000 = 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles

Then, calculate 1% of the defective candles:
1% of 2,500 = 0.01 * 2,500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
Discount = 30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
Discounted price = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
Total cost = 4 * $14 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60) = 440 - 3x.

However, we know that Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister does. Since her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, Joanne must gather at least 1 apple from the average trees. 

So, 440 - 3x ≥ 1. 

Solving for x, we get 3x ≤ 439, x ≤ 146.33.

Since x must be a whole number, the maximum value of x is 146.

Now, we can find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees: 440 - 3 * 146 = 440 - 438 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the number of dromedaries, we need to first find the number of camels. 

Since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can set up an equation based on the number of bumps (humps). 

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that:

2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, and there are 304 bumps in total)

We also know that the total number of heads is 180. Since each camel has 1 head and each dromedary has 1 head, we can set up another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have two equations:

2C + D = 304
C + D = 180

We can solve these equations by subtracting the second equation from the first:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into one of the original equations:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can set up the equation:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to add the elevation of Stanley and the distance the comb fell. 

Stanley's elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation of Stanley's comb: 10,000 + 4,000 = 14,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation to determine how many feet Oliver must climb.

Elevation of Stanley's comb: 14,000 feet
Elevation of Oliver: 3,000 feet
Difference: 14,000 - 3,000 = 11,000 feet

Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount of capital he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000
Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

2. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse.
   3/5 * 30 = 18 cats ran after the mouse
   Remaining cats = 30 - 18 = 12

There were 12 cats left on the rock.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $256."
"To find the cost of the jogger jeans, we need to first find the total cost of the jeans. Since Cole saved $6 in total and 1/3 of the savings came from the jogger jeans, the cost of the jogger jeans can be found by dividing the total savings by 3. 

$6 / 3 = $2

Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can set up an equation to find the cost of the tattered jeans:

Jogger jeans + $6 = Tattered jeans
$6 + $2 = $8

So, the tattered jeans cost $8.

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans:

$8 - $6 = $2

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian bought 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She built 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first calculate how much money he has after selling the cards. 

Since he has $50 in spending cash and he keeps 1/3 of the cards, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the cards are sold. 

Let's say he started with x cards. Then, he sold 2/3 * x cards. 

Since he sold each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he made from selling the cards is 2/3 * x * 1.5. 

We know that this amount, plus the $50 he already had, equals the cost of the amusement park ticket, which is $100. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2/3 * x * 1.5 + 50 = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 1 * x + 50 = 100.

Subtracting 50 from both sides, we get: x = 50.

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items first. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.

The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost.
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how much money George spent on chips, we need to calculate the total cost of the chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can assume that 1% of $5 is $0.05. This means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars ($4.95) by the cost of each candy bar (75 cents). 

$4.95 / 0.75 = 6.6

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to 6 candy bars.

The total cost of the ingredients: $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Since Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. 
The cost of the onions: 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00

The total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 + $8.00 = $16.00

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

For the bike ride, James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

For the run, we know Jon's run time is 50 minutes. We also know that James won by 10 minutes, so James' run time must be 10 minutes less than Jon's. 
James' run time is 50 - 10 = 40 minutes.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, we multiply the distance by 0.5:
16 miles * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay

A bail of hay costs $3, so we multiply the number of bails by the cost:
8 bails * $3 = $24

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, which is a total of:

- The super ticket costs $20 and includes a popcorn and a soda.
- The regular ticket costs $12 and you buy a popcorn and a soda separately.
- You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

Since you saved $2, the difference between the super ticket and the regular ticket is $2. The difference between the super ticket and the regular ticket is $20 - $12 = $8.

This $8 is the cost of the popcorn and the soda. We know the soda costs $3, so the cost of the popcorn is $8 - $3 = $5.

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to multiply the width, length, and height of each bed.

Volume of one bed = width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet

Since each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total volume / 2 = 320 / 2 = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be:
Total cost = Number of bags * cost per bag = 160 * 12 = $1920

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips:
3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Total earnings per week is 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings in a month is 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = 9 dollars. She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = 10 dollars. She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 dollars, or 1 dollar. So, she paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = 1 dollar.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total."
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. 

To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100: (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

The remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x. 

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x. We are given that this number is 20.

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for 5 days. 
40 pounds per day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. 

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.

Now that we know David found 12 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips in a week.

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. 
Total bus trips per week = 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

Cost of each bus trip = $2.20
Total cost of bus trips per week = 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00

Cost of weekly bus pass = $20

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of bus trips per week:
Savings = Total cost of bus trips per week - Cost of weekly bus pass
Savings = $22.00 - $20.00
Savings = $2.00

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep in each location.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add the total number of animals in both locations:
Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals in both locations is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To find the number of days Andy has to lose weight, we need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. 

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories over 211 days. 

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 
3500 calories / 211 days ≈ 16.6 calories per day

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 16.6 calories per day to reach his goal."

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Then, the cost of the house is 3x.

We know that the total cost is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3x

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills. 

Ali has 4 * $10 = $40 from the $10 bills and 6 * $20 = $120 from the $20 bills. 
Total money = $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
Remaining money = $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 = (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. 

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of chairs Ophelia has is x. 
Then, the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2. 
Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation: 
x - 2 = 20 
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 22 

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has. 
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs. 

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have. 
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 66 chairs. 
The total number of sofas and chairs is 20 + 22 + 66 = 108."

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation:
x + 10 = 2x + 5 - 5
x + 10 = 2x
10 = x

Now that we know Jame's current age is 10, we can find the age of his cousin. 
In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 10 + 8 = 18 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. 

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, and there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 2 to find the amount he needs to save in the first half of the month. 

$1125 / 2 = $562.50

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we can multiply the amount he saves in the first half by 2.

$562.50 * 2 = $1125

However, this is the total amount he needs to save in the second half, and there are 15 days in the second half of April. To find out how much he needs to save each day, we can divide the total amount by 15.

"To find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we need to calculate the time it takes on a hot day and a cold day separately.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3: 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time for 1 mile on a hot day: 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes. To find the time for 3 miles, we multiply the time for 1 mile by 3: 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time for 3 miles on a cold day from the time for 3 miles on a hot day: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The difference in time is 54 minutes.

"To find out how much John earns per week, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week. 

He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, so he earns:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we need to divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40) to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3. 

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40 = $120

Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost.

Total cost = $40 (foot-long fish sub) + $120 (six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There were 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons had four holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total, the number of buttons with four holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

The total number of holes in the buttons with four holes is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes: 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, there were 70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size: 12 * 1/4 = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. 

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks 0.5 cups. 
Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups. 
To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract 4 from 5: 5 - 4 = 1.

The answer is 1."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

Number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters
Number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

Final answer: 180"
"To find the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the pyramid.

The initial angle is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. 

In 10 hours, the sun will move 10 * 5 = 50 degrees.

So, the new angle will be 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

The final answer is 82."
"To find out how many candles James needs, we need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since James has two sons, he needs 2 * 5 = 10 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, the total cost of the candles will be 10 / 5 * 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first and second week: 
70 + 100 = 170

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many goals each teenager scored, we need to follow the information given:

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by all three teenagers: 
Richie's goals: 80
Mark's goals: 60
Anna's goals: 35
Total goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell: 21
Price of each lemonade: $4
Total amount Mitchell made: 21 * 4 = $84

Now, let's compare the amount Mitchell made to the amount Liam made. 

Liam made: $63
Mitchell made: $84

To find the difference, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made: 
$84 - $63 = $21

Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

"To find out how much Peter spent on wooden action figures, we need to calculate the total amount spent on them. Since he spent an equal amount each day from Sunday to Wednesday, and he has $70, he spent $70 / 4 = $17.50 per day on wooden action figures.

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he bought is $17.50 / $5 = 3.5. However, since you can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 3 wooden action figures.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount of money Peter has: $70 - $17.50 = $52.50.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is $52.50 / $2 = 26.25. Again, we'll round down to 26 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures + 26 plastic action figures = 29 action figures by the end of the week."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.

Spaying the kitten: $200
Vaccines: 3 vaccines * $20 each = $60

Total cost: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308

The kitten has cost $308 so far."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses he supplies per week by 4.

40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses the shops order in a month:

20 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 80 roses/month
15 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 60 roses/month
30 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 120 roses/month

Total roses ordered in a month = 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses/month

Now, let's subtract the total roses supplied from the total roses ordered to find out how many roses Ford lacks:

260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600.

Final answer: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 10 / 10 = 1 loaf
Cost of bread = $3.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Since the cost is given per 10 sandwiches, we need to calculate the cost for 10 sandwiches:
Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
Cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The net profit of the food truck is $37.00."
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. 

She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons. 
3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffins she can make.
192 / 8 = 24 muffins

Now, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.
24 * $1.50 = $36

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total area of the room and then add the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removal is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installation is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature and multiply by 100.

Difference = Actual temperature - Set temperature
= 468 - 450
= 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the new set temperature that is 4% higher than the actual temperature.

New set temperature = Actual temperature + (Actual temperature * Percentage off)
= 468 + (468 * 0.04)
= 468 + 18.72

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. 
10% of $100.00 is $10.00, so the discounted price of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Since 90 single-use contacts last 45 days, and Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total number of contacts he will get is 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.
Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

Number of times = total calories burned / 200
Number of times = 1600 / 200
Number of times = 8

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml of water.

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the value of B, we can find the values of R and G:

R = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485

G = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1509 - 1485 = 24

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the amount of mushrooms he eats per day by the amount of protein per cup:

200 grams (mushrooms) * 3 grams (protein per cup) = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7:

600 grams (protein per day) * 7 days = 4200 grams of protein per week

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.
The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents.

Adding all the values together, we get 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 / 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight he initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Total games after 3 years: 17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games

"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent.

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and add them together.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

"To find the total number of rotations, we need to multiply the number of miles driven by the number of rotations per mile.

First, we need to find the number of rotations per mile. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we divide 725 by 2 to get the rotations per mile.

725 / 2 = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we multiply the number of rotations per mile by the number of miles driven per month.

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per tire to find the number of tires.

145,000 rotations/month / 10,440 rotations/tire = 14.02 tires/month

Since we can't have a fraction of a tire, we round down to 14 tires.

Now, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per tire to find the number of months.

10,440,000 rotations / 14 tires = 750,000 months

There are 12 months in a year, so we divide the total number of months by 12 to find the number of years.

750,000 months / 12 months/year = 62,500 years

The tire needs to be replaced in 62,500 years."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Now, we need to convert the cost from dollars to cents. 
$12.00 = 1200 cents

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the total cost. However, the problem doesn't specify the sales tax rate. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (which is common in many places), 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20
Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he will be short $6.70 after the purchase."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. 
4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we multiply 28 dozen by 1/4 pound:
28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days.

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost of repaving Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194 per meter
Cost of repaving Lewis' street = $94,860

To find the difference in cost, we need to subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Difference in cost = Cost of repaving Lewis' street - Cost of repaving Monica's street
Difference in cost = $94,860 - $29,100

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,437,625

Now, we add the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $2,437,625 = $2,937,625

The total cost of John's research is $2,937,625."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so 8 ounces of meat.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces.

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he uses 2 * 20 gallons = 40 gallons per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total gallons of water used per year is 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons/year.

Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the cost per class from it.

Total cost of classes = $60
Cost per class = $10

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to find out how many classes he can afford to miss before the total cost exceeds $100.

Let's assume Manny can miss x classes. The total cost of the classes he attends will be 10 - x. The cost of the classes he misses will be x * $10.

The total cost of the classes he attends and misses should be less than or equal to $100. So, we can set up the inequality:

10 - x + 10x ≤ 100

Combine like terms:

9x ≤ 90

Divide both sides by 9:

x ≤ 10

Since Manny can't miss more than 10 classes, the answer is 10.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500

"To find the total number of articles published, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website in February and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day. In February, there are 28 days, so the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. In February, there are 28 days, so the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. 
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
She got $2 off, so the final price is $400 - $2 = $398

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. 
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60
The final price is $600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of green hats. 

Let's denote the sales of green hats as G. Since the sales of red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5G
G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, the sales of green hats were $800 in the first month.

Now, let's calculate the total sales for the first month:
Total sales in the first month = Sales of red hats + Sales of green hats
Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

Now, let's calculate the total sales for two months:
Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
Total sales in two months = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the number of whole eggs needed.

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 whole eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens needed.

24 whole eggs / 12 = 2 dozen eggs

Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the total cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. 
The monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (monthly cost for 12 months) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To find the cooking time for beans, we need to first find the cooking time for pork. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took 30 minutes to cook rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as:
4s + 2g = 70

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is:
s + g = 20

We can solve these equations to find the number of sheep. 

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' in both equations the same:
2s + 2g = 40

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate 'g':
(2s + 2g) - (4s + 2g) = 40 - 70
This simplifies to:
-2s = -30
Dividing both sides by -2 gives us:
s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the cost of the coffee, we need to calculate the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week. Since he uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds for a week.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5.

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1
The more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Since Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee, the total cost of the more expensive brand is 7 * $6 = $42

Adding the cost of the donut, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James initially had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys.
4. However, when James came back, he found that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 12 - 3 = 9 toys.
5. Since James initially had 4 toys, he needs to buy 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

In total, James needs 12 (initially needed) + 5 (additional needed) = 17 toys.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the other twin would be x + 7.

For the triplets, let's denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. Since there is one set of triplets, the ages of the other two triplets would be y + 1 and y + 2.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 2y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 2y = 34

Divide both sides by 2:

x + y = 17

Now, we need to find the age of one of the twins. Since the twin is 7 years older than the other twin, we can write:

x + 7 = one of the twins' age

We don't know the exact age of the other twin, but we can express it as x.

Since x + y = 17, we can substitute y = 17 - x into the equation x + 7:

x + 7 = one of the twins' age
x + 7 = x
7 = one of the twins' age

So, one of the twins is 7 years old.

So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Neil saves 28 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Since we want to know the total number of coins Neil has saved after 10 years, we multiply the number of coins he saves per year by 10. 
336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

Now, we add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved after 10 years. 
2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as x. 
0.6x = 60

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.6.
x = 60 / 0.6
x = 100

The total bill is $100. The cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100. 

Since the total bill is $100 and John brought $125, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought.
$125 - $100 = $25

John leaves with $25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and one apple costs $0.5. 
So, the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points: 
Adam + Betty + Tom + Marta = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

"To find the total number of people, we need to add Aiden and his 12 friends to the 7 more friends they meet at the cinema. 

Total number of people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends
Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7
Total number of people = 20

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed as follows:

Total number of drinks = 2 * Total number of people
Total number of drinks = 2 * 20
Total number of drinks = 40

Total number of snacks = 3 * Total number of people
Total number of snacks = 3 * 20
Total number of snacks = 60

Since each drink and snack costs $2, we can calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks as follows:

Total cost of drinks = Total number of drinks * $2
Total cost of drinks = 40 * $2
Total cost of drinks = $80

Total cost of snacks = Total number of snacks * $2
Total cost of snacks = 60 * $2
Total cost of snacks = $120

Total cost of drinks and snacks = Total cost of drinks + Total cost of snacks

"To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first find out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry and then subtract that from the total amount the three trucks can carry.

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The total amount the three trucks can carry is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the amount Gissela and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total: 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 40%. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If 80% of the 40% is used for industrial purposes, we need to find the percentage of the total water that 40% represents.

Let's assume the total water is 100%. Then, 40% of 100% is 40%. Since 80% of 40% is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage of the total water used for industrial purposes by multiplying 40% by 80%:

40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, we can find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes by subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%:

100% - 32% = 68%

So, the city uses 68% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each flavor and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, and she gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she buys, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

- 2 scoops cost 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 1 scoop is free, so the total cost is $3.00

Since Erin has $6.00, she can afford 4 scoops (2 scoops x 2 sets of 2 scoops each). 

4 scoops would cost 4 x $1.50 = $6.00, which is the amount Erin has.

"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 of them, they ate 2 * (2/3) = 4/3 of the total pizza. 

The remaining 3 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 3 of them, they ate 3 * (3/4) = 9/4 of the total pizza.

The total fraction of pizza eaten is 4/3 + 9/4. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. 

(4/3) * (4/4) = 16/12
(9/4) * (3/3) = 27/12

Now, we can add them together: 16/12 + 27/12 = 43/12.

Since they ate 43/12 of the pizza, the remaining fraction of the pizza is 1 - 43/12 = 69/12.

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 69 ÷ 12 = 5.75.

Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices left is 5.75 * 12 = 68."

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches first. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches: 
8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Now, we add the 4 inches to get the total length of Topher's shoe: 
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 
So, we can write the equation: 
9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 
9x = 100 - 10 
9x = 90 
x = 90 / 9 
x = 10 

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long."

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we need to subtract Beck's new amount from Boris's new amount. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
So, Beck has 90 - 87 = 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube.

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how many ounces he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

32 - 30 = 2 ounces

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to first find the number of students who like to play music. 

Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, and 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of students in the class is 50. We know that 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - (10 + 5) = 35.

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 / 2 = 40 students in each class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.

"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Mark received 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

There are 30 cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark received is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: 
$6500 - $5400 = $1100

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have.

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 
Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can find out how many marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4. 
Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their marbles together. 
Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles = 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find the number of students per group. 
54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 5 students per group.

Now, we need to find the total number of groups needed. 
54 students / 5 students per group = 10.8 groups.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 11 groups.

To find the number of groups needed, we subtract the number of groups already formed from the total number of groups required. 
12 groups - 10 groups = 2 groups.

Therefore, 2 more groups are needed to form."
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

Weekdays: 
There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20.
Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 20 * 60 = 1200.

Weekends: 
There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8.
Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 8 * 100 = 800.

Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to first determine the number of votes against it. 

Let's assume the number of votes against the new regulation is x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor: 2x = 2(11) = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students for each size.

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size to find the total number of shirts ordered:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
   1/3 * 600 = 200 movies in series.

2. The cost of these series is 6 times the cost of a normal movie, which is 6 * $10 = $60.

3. Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract that from the total:
   600 - 200 = 400 movies remaining.

4. Now, we need to find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
   40/100 * 400 = 160 older movies.

5. The cost of these older movies is $5 each, so we multiply the number of older movies by the cost:
   160 * $5 = $800.

6. The cost of the normal movies is the number of normal movies multiplied by the cost of a normal movie:
   400 * $10 = $4000.

7. Finally, we add the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies to get the total cost:

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 times.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 15 + 6 = 21 times.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish (this is not possible, so we will ignore this result). However, we can assume that the 17 fish taken out were not all orange. 

Let's say the number of orange fish taken out is x. Then, the number of white fish taken out is 17 - x.

Now, Bob has 3 - x orange fish and 4 - (17 - x) = 4 - 17 + x = -13 + x white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2(-13 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = -26 + 2x

Combine like terms:

3 + 26 = 2x + x

29 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 29/3

x is not a whole number, but since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we will round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can solve for x by setting up an equation with the given information.

Let's try to find the number of white fish taken out. We know that the number of white fish taken out is 17 - x. Since the number of white fish after the addition is 4 - (17 - x), we can set up the equation:

(4 - (17 - x)) / (3 - x) = 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(4 - 17 + x) / (3 - x) = 2

(-13 + x) / (3 - x) = 2

Multiply both sides by (3 - x):

-13 + x = 2(3 - x)

-13 + x = 6 - 2x

Combine like terms:

x + 2x = 6 + 13

3x = 19

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 19/3

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of gas consumed per week = $15

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants 30% of her stuffed animals to be goats, we can set up an equation to find the number of goats she needs:

Let x be the number of goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We want 30% of this total to be goats, so we can set up the equation:

0.30(14 + x) = x

To solve for x, we can start by distributing the 0.30:

4.2 + 0.30x = x

Now, we can subtract 0.30x from both sides:

4.2 = 0.70x

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.70:

6 = x

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them.

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. 

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900. 
The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the diamond and gold, and the premium. 
Total cost = $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed, which is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.
Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed, which is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
Fifth-graders: Since the pass rate for fifth graders is twice that of fourth graders, it is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
Third-graders: 340
Fourth-graders: 40
Fifth-graders: 2 * 80 = 160
Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 160 = 540

Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (540 / 1000) * 100 = 54%

The school's overall pass rate is 54%."
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make, we need to multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag and then divide by the number of chips per square inch.

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we multiply the number of square inches by the height: 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Dale started with 100 candies and sold 150, so he has 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, he then ordered 100 more, so now he has 100 - 50 = 50 candies left.

Since he wants to sell all the candies, we need to subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered. 

100 (total candies) - 50 (candies he has) = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles from 10 to 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles from 20 to 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles from 40 to 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles from 80 to 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles from 160 to 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract 10 from 320.

320 - 10 = 310

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total branches = Total money / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we can divide the total branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

For the 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
For the 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
For the 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
For the 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, so we need to subtract 1 for each type: 
- 1 * 5 = 5 petals
- 1 * 6 = 6 petals
- 1 * 4 = 4 petals
- 1 * 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals: 101 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows used and the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Marshmallows dropped = 3

Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Total marshmallows left = 35 - 18 = 17

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores that can be made with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores that can be made by 2 (since there are 2 kids).

Number of S'mores per kid = 17 / 2 = 8.5

Since you can't have half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores per kid.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he needs 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person also needs 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The friend who is significantly better plays for 1.5 times as long, so they play for 180 minutes. This person needs 180 / 20 = 9 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 + 6 + 9 = 27 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is 27 * $0.25 = $6.75.

The final answer is: 6.75"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, and the amount of citrus zest as Z.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + F + O + Z + sugar = 10.

Since F = Z and S = sugar, we can rewrite the equation as:
S + S + O + S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
3S + O = 10

We also know that O = 2S, so we can substitute O with 2S:
3S + 2S = 10
Combine like terms:
5S = 10

Divide both sides by 5:
S = 2

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2 * 2
O = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

The total amount of money John spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Now, Joe has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations ($50,000) from the total amount raised ($175,000). 

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we divide the remaining amount by 20 to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

The answer is 6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first. 

She walked 8 hours on the first day. 
She walked half as many hours on the second day, so she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

Now, we add the time she walked on both days: 
8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week.

Since John does 30 cycles a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks he completes in a week is:
150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a week is:
1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 
88 - 36 = 52.

The difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food is 52."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. 

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has: 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

"To find the height Naruto can lift, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the distance, we can use the information that 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours. We can set up a proportion to find the distance.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108 hours

Now we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 108 hours / 3 turtles
Time = 36 hours

However, we need to find the time for four turtles, so we need to multiply the time by 4.

Time = 36 hours * 4
Time = 144 hours

Therefore, it will take four turtles 144 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80. So, the total amount she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation to find out how much she has in her purse:

$400 (new price) - $50 (remaining amount needed) = $350 (total amount she has)

So, Erika has $350 in her purse."

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of the glue sticks that are used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. 
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is used. 
The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

Year 1: Interest = $225, Total = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = $225, Total = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Interest = $225, Total = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to know that half of the 40 white shirts have collars. 

Half of 40 is 20, so 20 white shirts have collars. 
The remaining 20 white shirts have no collars.

Now, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. 
There are 50 floral shirts in total, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars. 
30 (floral shirts with no buttons) - 20 (white shirts with no collars) = 10.

"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

Total amount spent per year: $2640
Number of pairs bought per year: 2

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

The average cost per pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, first, calculate the cost of the green food: 
3 baskets of green food * $25 per basket = $75

Next, calculate the cost of the red food with the discount:
3 baskets of red food * $18 per basket = $54
Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, subtract $6 from the total cost of the red food:
$54 - $6 = $48

Now, add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 is 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply 45 rooms by 20 minutes per room:

45 * 20 = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 / 60 = 15 hours

The answer is 15."
"To find the total number of homes built, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S.

2. I am three years younger than my brother, so A = B - 3.

3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so A = S + 2.

4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so M = 3B - 1.

5. The sum of our ages is 87, so A + B + S + M = 87.

Now, we can substitute the expressions for A, B, and M in terms of S into the equation A + B + S + M = 87.

Substituting A = S + 2 and M = 3B - 1 into the equation, we get:
(S + 2) + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:
2S + 4B - 1 = 87

Now, we need to express B in terms of S. From A = S + 2, we can express B as B = A - 3 = (S + 2) - 3 = S - 1.

Substitute B = S - 1 into the equation 2S + 4B - 1 = 87:
2S + 4(S - 1) - 1 = 87

Expand and simplify:
2S + 4S - 4 - 1 = 87
6S - 5 = 87

Add 5 to both sides:
6S = 92

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 15.33

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber earns twice as many badges as Claire, so she earns 2 * 12 = 24 badges in a year.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, she bakes 2 * 8 = 16 slices per hour. 

In 5 hours, she bakes 16 * 5 = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for 50 cents, we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 50 cents is 0.5 dollars. 

To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) 
Total coins = 110

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weighed 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weighed 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will have: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs. We can do this by dividing the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 = $3500

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends per month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to get the weekly cost. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. 
2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total number of pieces.
60 - 24 = 36 pieces remaining.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. 
36 - 10 = 26 pieces remaining.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. 
7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since you can't eat a fraction of a piece).

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day.
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

The final answer is 48."

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly.
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly.
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly.
Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens. 

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he wants to make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much he paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to make ($11000) by the number of chickens (180):

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's glasses from Julie's glasses.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

"To find Melanie's present age, we need to subtract 10 years from her age in 10 years. 

Melanie's age in 10 years = 18
Melanie's present age = 18 - 10 = 8

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Let's assume her age in x years will be 3 times her present age. 

3 * 8 = 24
x = 24

Since x is the number of years from now, we need to subtract 8 (her present age) from 24 to get the number of years from now.

x - 8 = 24 - 8
x - 8 = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the equation: 
whatchamacallit speed = 11 * thingamabob speed

We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:
121 = 11 * thingamabob speed

To find the thingamabob speed, we divide both sides by 11:
thingamabob speed = 121 / 11
thingamabob speed = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the thingamabob speed, we can find the whirligig speed:
whirligig speed = 5 * thingamabob speed
whirligig speed = 5 * 11
whirligig speed = 55 meters per second

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find the cost of the yogurt, we need to know its price. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 for her daily goods. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost to find the cost of the carrots. $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day.

"To find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns, we need to first determine how many times she mowed each lawn.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn x times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is 6x + 80 = 6(1) + 80 = 86.

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33

So Joseph had 2.33 notebooks. However, since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, and Calvin is an adult, we can assume that the pot can fill 4 bowls. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 + 2 = 6 people. 

Since the pot can fill 4 bowls, and there are 6 people, there will be 2 bowls of soup left over. 

Now, we need to divide the leftover soup by the number of child's bowls the pot can fill, which is 8. 

2 bowls / 8 bowls = 0.25 

Since you can't have a fraction of a bowl, we can round down to 0. However, in this context, it's more logical to say that each child can have 1 bowl of soup for lunch, and the remaining 2 bowls can be saved for another meal or used for something else."

For large masks:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards
So, 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards are needed for large masks, which is 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation: 
   Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * (Adam's age 4 years ago)
   60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
   52 = 2x - 8

2. Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
   52 + 8 = 2x
   60 = 2x

3. Divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':
   x = 60 / 2
   x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

4. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Total amount spent is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each girl received.

$31 / 2 = $15.5.

Their mother gave each of them $15.5."
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing sports is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we add the total number of students playing sports: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The total number of students is 56.

56"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold, the total cost of the lollipops, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 * 10
Total number of lollipops sold = 300

Total revenue = Total number of lollipops sold * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Total cost = Total number of lollipops bought * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of mint tea. 

Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide 8 hours by 4 hours to get 2 trips. 

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 trips. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips. 

So, we divide 24 berries by 2 trips to get 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the amount of water in the tank initially, we need to calculate half of the pool's water. 
Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, after 6 days, the tank will be emptied by 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

So, the remaining water in the tank will be 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since we don't know the exact number of days left in the month, we'll assume it's a 30-day month for simplicity. 

There are 5 Fridays and 5 Saturdays, so Colby has already seen 10 movies. There are 15 days left in the month (30 - 10 - 5 = 15). 

Colby can see 15 / 10 = 1.5 movies on the remaining days. Since you can't see half a movie, we'll round down to 1 movie.

Colby can see 1 more movie on the remaining days.

The final answer is 1."
"To find the total calories of the mini pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked:

200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total. 
Average Junebugs removed per day = 300 / 5 = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys she already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Toys she already had: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the value of A from equation 2 into equation 3: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute the value of P from equation 3 into equation 1:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substitute A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Now that we know Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total, including Maria, the total number of additional balloons is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons (10) to the additional balloons (15) to get the total number of balloons: 10 + 15 = 25.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

"To find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance spat by Zoey, multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat: 
40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet

To find the total distance spat by Sydney, multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat: 
35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the total distance spat by both, add the distances spat by Zoey and Sydney: 
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, divide the total distance by the total number of seeds (since each seed was spat once): 
(820 feet + 35 seeds) / 75 seeds = 820 feet / 75 seeds = 10.93 feet per seed

The average total distance spat is 10.93 feet."

"To find out how much Cameron would pay, we first need to calculate the number of hours he stays at the hotel. 

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. So, he stays for 18 hours.

Since he chooses the 12-hour option for the first 12 hours, he pays 1000 pesos. 

For the remaining 6 hours, he adds 70 pesos for each hour. So, he pays 6 * 70 = 420 pesos.

The total amount Cameron pays is 1000 + 420 = 1420 pesos.

The 24-hour option would cost 1600 pesos. 

Cameron saves 1600 - 1420 = 180 pesos.

The final answer is 180."
"To find the amount of hay each sheep needs, we need to calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds. 

Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep. 

15 goats * 5 pounds = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his earnings first. 

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left.

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. 

Now, he has 250 - 50 = 200 dollars left.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs. 

The original price of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the price James paid for the CDs is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for the CDs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find out how far James swims. Since he swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, we calculate 60% of 20 miles:
   60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

2. Now, we need to find out how long it takes James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
   Time = 6 hours

3. After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for:
   Rest time = 6 hours / 2
   Rest time = 3 hours

4. Now, we need to find out how far James has to swim after resting. Since he has already swum 12 miles, the remaining distance is:
   Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
   Remaining distance = 8 miles

5. James swims the remaining 8 miles at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour:
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
   Time = 8 hours

6. Now, we add up the swimming time, rest time, and the time spent swimming the remaining distance:
   Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
   Total time = 17 hours

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points. 

We also know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 0 = 45.

Subtract 0 from both sides: 3x = 45.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15.

So, Dinar scored 15 points. 

Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 = (15 + 10) - 20 = 5 points.

The final answer is 5."

"To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day, we add the holes dug each day: 
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we multiply the number of holes by 4: 
31 * 4 = 124 holes.

Now, we subtract the holes dug on the first three days (31) from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day (124) to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day:
124 - 31 = 93 holes.

The final answer is: 93"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins got. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we add the corn chips of all three: 
Amora + Lainey + Collins = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'A', the number caught by Stan as 'S', and the number caught by Alex as 'X'. 

We know that:
1. X = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13
3. X + S + A = 339

We can substitute the value of X from equation 1 into equation 3:
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 2 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is traveling south for the first and third legs, we need to subtract the distance covered in the second leg from the sum of the first and third legs to find the total distance between the northern and southern homes:
300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at her office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home.

She made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself.
She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies at her office party.
Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home.

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members: 
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

Time for synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

Now, we can add the number of players in both teams to find the total:

Total number of players = Number of players in Zeke's team + Number of players in Carlton's team
= 20 + 13
= 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Given length = 15 feet and width = 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box.

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 4 boxes in total.

240 oranges - 4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 - 80 = 160 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and gave away from the total to find out how many she sold.

240 - 60 (kept) - 80 (given away) = 100 oranges

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in India and the USA.

The number of states in India is not explicitly given, but we know that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. 

Let's assume the number of states in the USA is x. Then, the number of states in India is x + 4.

We know that the total number of states in the USA is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) = 50

Combine like terms:
2x + 4 = 50

Subtract 4 from both sides:
2x = 46

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 23

Now that we know the number of states in the USA (x = 23), we can find the number of states in India:
x + 4 = 23 + 4 = 27

The total number of states in both countries is 50 (USA) + 27 (India) = 77.

"To find out how much Tyler needs to earn, we need to add up the cost of the books and subtract the amount he already has.

Cost of books = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work.

Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard has. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation: 
Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries from Robert's and Richard's combined:
Total cherries = 60
Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries = 30 + 20 = 50
Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to determine the number of boxes sold on Sunday first.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Since he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Sunday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday. Since he sold 4 boxes of apple pie on Saturday, he sold 4 - 4 = 0 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
Apple pie: 4 boxes * $15 = $60
Total earnings for Saturday: $60 + $60 = $120
Total earnings for Sunday: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
Total earnings for two days: $120 + $90 = $210

The final answer is: $210"
"To find out how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total number of hours she'll be outside.

She'll be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total number of hours is:

The price of the blue car is $100.
The price of the red car is $60.

The final answer is: $100, $60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne had, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Now, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we need to find the average of 5 (Sophie's size) and 25 (Charlie's size). 

Average = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

The length of the bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.
The width of each plant and the space between them is 1.5 feet, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

Now, we can divide the length of the bed by the width of each plant and the space between them: 
1332 / 18 = 74.67

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 74 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we multiply 18 by 1/2 to get 9 pretzels per day for Edgar's brother.

Now, we need to multiply 9 pretzels per day by 7 days in a week to get the total number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. 

9 pretzels per day * 7 days = 63 pretzels per week.

The answer is 63."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

Cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
Cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many shoes she can buy.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, it will take her 30 / 6 = 5 minutes to peel 30 shrimp.

Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, it will take her 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp.

So, it will take her 5 minutes to peel and 10 minutes to cook, for a total of 5 + 10 = 15 minutes to peel and cook 30 shrimp.

To find out how long it will take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply 15 minutes by 3, which is 15 * 3 = 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The total cooling effect is the sum of the cooling effects on low and high:
6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room will warm up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the final temperature:
Initial temperature - (cooling effect - warming effect) = final temperature
Initial temperature - (18 degrees - 4 degrees) = final temperature
Initial temperature - 14 degrees = final temperature

However, we don't know the initial temperature. We can represent the final temperature as a number of degrees lower than the starting temperature. Let's call the initial temperature 'x'. Then, the final temperature is x - 14 degrees.

Since we want to find the difference between the final temperature and the starting temperature, we can represent the difference as:
x - (x - 14) = 14 degrees

"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to set up an equation. 

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the equation:

x = 3 * 30
x = 90

So, Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 flights.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22.

"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total amount he spent: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now we know Helene's age is 10.
7. We can now write the equation for the total age: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on the total amount Walter has collected.

However, the problem states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount Walter has collected so far.

Since Walter's friend is going to give him $200, we can add this amount to the total amount Walter has collected so far: $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, we can calculate the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates, and Walter has collected $2200, we can divide $2200 by 4 (including Walter himself) to find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute: $2200 / 4 = $550.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate 1/2 of 100 guests multiplied by 15 cookies per guest.

1/2 of 100 guests = 50 guests
50 guests * 15 cookies = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The answer is 50."
"To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to first determine the total number of slices. 

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's assume the total number of slices is x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is 2. 

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices each adult gets and the slices each kid gets. Since each kid gets 1 slice, the total number of slices is 2 (adults) + 4 (kids) = 6.

So, x = 6.

Now, to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

Percentage of watermelon each adult gets = (2 / 6) * 100 = 33.33%

The final answer is 33.33."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the total cost of the students' lessons per week is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The total cost of the students' lessons per week is $15 * 3 = $45.

The total cost of the students' lessons per month is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the sum of the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons, which is $300 + $180 = $480.

"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines: 50 + 1440 = 1490.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10480 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total gallons needed.

10480 gallons * 5.9 = 61916 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = 61916 gallons * $0.10/gallon
Cost = $6191.60

The final answer is: $6191.60"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks first.

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks.
Total number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow)
Total number of sticks = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 
55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 
45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. 
1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 are male. 
1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

To find the number of female students over 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16. 
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16. 
1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 years old to find the total number of female students. 
1125 + 750 = 1875 female students.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons were pumped.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons were pumped.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
Initial charge - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
Initial charge - 45% - 21% = 28%
Initial charge - 66% = 28%
Initial charge = 28% + 66% = 94%

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 left. However, this is not possible since he can't have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: 139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

"To find the total time James spent reading, we need to calculate the time it took him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he read (18 pages). 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spent 60 minutes reading.

"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to calculate the total number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who checked in during the afternoon is 2 * 15 = 30.

7 more guests checked in after dinner, so the total number of guests who checked in is 30 + 7 = 37.

The total number of guests now is 76 (remaining guests) + 37 (new guests) = 113.

The hotel now has 113 guests.

"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide 60 by 2 to find the number of each type of question.
60 / 2 = 30

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 30 * 0.5 = 15.

So, Aries is sure to get 18 + 15 = 33 points."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a small stuffed animal is x/3.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so we can set up the equation:

x/3 = 4

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:

x = 12

Now that we know the price of a large stuffed animal is $12, we can find the total revenue from large stuffed animals. Let's say Teresa sold L large stuffed animals. The total revenue from large stuffed animals is 12L.

We also know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals is 2L.

The total revenue from small stuffed animals is 2L * (x/3) = 2L * (12/3) = 8L.

We know that the total revenue from both large and small stuffed animals is $120, so we can set up the equation:

12L + 8L = 120

Combine like terms:

20L = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

L = 6

Since L represents the number of large stuffed animals, we know that Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2L = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"

Now, multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

The friends found 60 eggs."
"To find the amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to calculate the amount of ore mined per day and then multiply it by 30.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf can mine twice as much, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

With a steel pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

Now, we multiply this by 30 days to get the total amount of ore mined in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Money from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates and faculty = 950 + 300 = 1250

Remaining seats for graduates = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium beans.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3 to find out how many small beans he can eat. 

150 / 3 = 50

So, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years in school by the annual income Jim had before college.

Total money lost = 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new income is 3 * $25,000 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how much he earns per year after college, we need to add the money he earns from his job and the money he earns from his degree.

New income per year = $75,000 (from the degree) + $25,000 (from his job) = $100,000 per year

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take for Jim to pay off the loans. 

Total amount to pay off = $100,000 (lost) + $50,000 (loans) = $150,000

Number of years to pay off the loans = Total amount to pay off / New income per year
= $150,000 / $100,000
= 1.5 years

Since Jim didn't work during the 4 years he was in school, we need to add those 4 years to the 1.5 years it takes to pay off the loans.

Total years to earn back the money = 4 years (lost) + 1.5 years (to pay off loans)

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

The net loss in the second race is $10 - $5 = $5.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
He won $10 in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $10 = $15 in the third race.

The total amount lost is $5 (first race) + $5 (second race) + $15 (third race) = $25.

To find the average loss, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races: $25 / 3 = $8.33.

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches = 4.33 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 52 inches = 4.33 feet)

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet

To convert the difference to inches, we multiply by 12:
0.08 feet * 12 inches/foot = 0.96 inches

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 0.96 inches."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 420

So, the first person took $420.

"To find the total hours worked, we need to calculate the total hours in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find 3/8ths of 21 days. 

3/8 * 21 = 7.875 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 7.875 days by 24 hours.

7.875 * 24 = 189 hours

Now, we need to divide the total hours by the number of painters (4) to find the hours each painter worked.

189 / 4 = 47.25 hours

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of non-Spanish books. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 
50 - 25 - 5 = 20

There are 20 Spanish books."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

Final answer: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide 240 by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 / 16 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. 

Since each tile is 1ft in length and the floor area is 200 SqFt, we can fit 200 tiles in the floor. 

Now, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile: 
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12.

$192 * 12 = $2304

James pays $2304 a year."
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched in a weekend = 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to calculate the stickers he collected each year and add them together.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
Now, we add the stickers from each year: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's slices: 
10 - 3 = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2 to find Silvia's slices:
7 * 2 = 14

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by each person:
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

The total number of slices eaten is 31.

"To find the time Betsy's part took, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

The visit costs $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, the visit costs $300/2 = $150.

The cast costs $200.

The painkillers cost $4/pill, and Hannah needs 30 painkillers. So, the painkillers cost 30 * $4 = $120.

The parking costs $6/hour for 2 hours, so the parking costs 2 * $6 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150 (visit) + $200 (cast) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney was left with 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.
3. Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so now he has 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total pounds of butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds he can buy, we divide the total pounds of butter he needs (6) by 2. 6 / 2 = 3 sets.

Since each set costs $4.00, and he gets one half off, the cost of each set will be $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be 3 sets * $2.00 per set = $6.00."

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, so she has a total of 5 * 5 = $25.

To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the cost of roses from the total amount she has: $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we multiply $6.25 by 4: 6.25 * 4 = 25 quarters.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, and the fourth train departs at 145 minutes. So, Paul will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

"To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we multiply 2000 by 0.75 to get the sale price: 
2000 * 0.75 = 1500

Now, we need to find the original price. Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, we can set up the equation: 
Original price * 0.75 = 1500
Original price = 1500 / 0.75
Original price = 2000

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 
120% of 1500 is 1500 * 1.2 = 1800

The original price was 2000, and Mr. Rogers sold it to his friend for 1800. To find the discount percentage, we subtract the sale price from the original price and divide by the original price:
Discount = (2000 - 1800) / 2000
Discount = 200 / 2000
Discount = 0.1
Discount percentage = 0.1 * 100

"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and then back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk to the store is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since he walked back home, the total distance he covered is 4 miles (to the store) + 4 miles (back home) = 8 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
Since the rest of the bikes were MTB, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Now, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is: 17.6875"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the total number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, and the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the velociraptors ate 270 kilograms, which is half of the amount left after the T-Rex ate.

Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of it, we can say that 270 kilograms is half of 'x'. 

We can write this as an equation: 270 = x/2

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 2: 
x = 270 * 2
x = 540 kilograms

This is the amount left after the T-Rex ate. Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, we can say that the initial amount is twice the amount left after the T-Rex ate.

So, the initial amount is 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to first determine the total number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. Ellen's friend can get sprayed with soda from this shaken can. 

The total number of sodas left is 1 (shaken) + 2 (unshaken) = 3 sodas.

The likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, expressed as a percentage.

Likelihood = (1 shaken soda / 3 total sodas) * 100
Likelihood = (1/3) * 100
Likelihood = 33.33%

The final answer is 33.33."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to work and the number of people he can help per day.

Billy is available to work for 31 days in March, but he takes 20% of the days off. 
20% of 31 days is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to work for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. 
So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of people he can help per day by the number of days he is available to work: 
6 people/day * 25 days = 150 people.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, we need to find the total time for 5 days:
1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. 
We can subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total to find the distance run by Ahito. 
52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

1. The item that was returned is $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

2. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

3. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we add the cost of the items after the discounts to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the other jellyfish are not large, they are the ones that do not change color. The number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are large and change color. We know that the number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15, so we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be a mistake in the question. Assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income and spends 40% of her income, we can proceed.

20% of $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

40% of $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Lauren saves $20,000 per year and spends $40,000 per year. This means she is in a deficit of $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save for a 20-year retirement period, we need to calculate how much she needs to save in total.

Total savings needed for 20 years = $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can divide the total savings needed by her annual savings to find out how many years she needs to work.

Number of years = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $400,000 / $20,000
= 20 years.

However, this is the number of years she needs to work to save for the retirement period, not considering the deficit. Since she is in a deficit of $20,000 per year, she needs to work more years to cover this deficit.

Total years worked = Total savings needed / Annual savings
= $400,000 / $20,000
= 20 years.

Since she is in a deficit, we need to add the deficit years to the total years worked.

Total years worked = 20 years (to save) + 20 years (to cover the deficit)
= 40 years.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of heels, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so she actually had $12 - $2 = $10 left. But this is not possible since she has $2 left. This means the initial $4 she spent was not spent on the books. 

Let's recalculate: Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. She then spent $2 on the books, so she had $12 - $2 = $10 left. Since she has $2 left, it means the $10 she had after buying the books is the amount she had before buying the books. 

Now, let's find out how much each book cost. Anna bought 2 books, and she had $10 before buying the books. So, the cost of each book is $10 / 2 = $5.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Since Vince's age 2 years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know that:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box and then multiply by the weight of each box.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Crayons per box
= 200 / 8

Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons, since each box weighs 8 ounces. So, the total weight of the boxes is also 12.5 pounds.

Total weight of crayons and boxes = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk and then add it to the time spent on the beach.

First, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, we can assume she walks twice as far in the same amount of time. 

Let's denote the time spent on the sidewalk as 'x' minutes. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, she walks 2 miles on the beach in the same amount of time. We know that 40 minutes is spent on the beach, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 20

So, Grandma spends 20 minutes on the sidewalk.

Now, we can find the total time spent on the walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total time = 40 minutes (beach) + 20 minutes (sidewalk) = 60 minutes

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 * 8 = $32.

To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has saved from the total amount she wants to save: 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take: 28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

"To find out how many marbles Bob originally had, we need to first calculate the total number of marbles he has after receiving 2 dozen more. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, after receiving 2 dozen more marbles, Bob will have 60 marbles. 

To find out how many marbles he originally had, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of water Donny has after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug.

Donny starts with 2 mugs of water. After pouring, he has 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug. 

Since he can drink the water, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. 

Now, let's assume the unknown temperature mug contains x ounces of water. 

We know that the total amount of water is 5 ounces, so we can set up the equation:

x + 1 = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4

This means the unknown temperature mug contains 4 ounces of water.

Since the temperature of the water is directly proportional to its volume, we can set up a proportion to find the temperature of the unknown mug:

(33 degrees) / 33 ounces = (x degrees) / 4 ounces

Solving for x, we get:

x = (33 * 4) / 33
x = 4

However, this is the volume of the unknown mug, not the temperature. We need to find the temperature. 

Since the temperature is directly proportional to the volume, we can set up a proportion using the initial temperatures:

(33 degrees) / 33 ounces = (x degrees) / 4 ounces

We know that the total amount of water is 5 ounces, and 4 ounces came from the 33-degree mug. The remaining 1 ounce came from the unknown temperature mug. 

So, the ratio of the temperatures is the same as the ratio of the volumes:

(33 degrees) / 33 ounces = (x degrees) / 1 ounce

Solving for x, we get:

x = (33 * 1) / 33
x = 1

However, this is the temperature of the 1-ounce portion of the unknown mug. We need to find the temperature of the entire mug.

Since the 1-ounce portion is 1/4 of the total volume, we can multiply the temperature by 4:

x = 1 * 4
x = 4

However, this is the temperature of the 4-ounce portion of the unknown mug. We need to find the temperature of the entire mug.

Since the 4-ounce portion is 1/4 of the total volume, we can multiply the temperature by 4:

x = 4 * 4
x = 16

So, the temperature of the unknown mug is at least 16 degrees.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, three weeks will have 21 days (3 * 7).

Total number of cows added in 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added in 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he has a total of 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans. 

60 (total) - 17 (green) - 34 (red) = 9

There are 9 blue jellybeans."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

"To find the number of women on the bus, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14.

We can then divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 84 / 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part: 9 * 6 = 54.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

The number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 × 3 = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 × 12 = 252 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:
Adam invests $100, and each rock costs $5, so the total number of rocks he can buy is:
$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory:
60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks
Each rock is sold for $7, so the total revenue is:
12 rocks * $7 = $84

Now, let's calculate the total cost and the loss:
Total cost = 20 rocks * $5 = $100
Total revenue = $84
Loss = Total cost - Total revenue = $100 - $84 = $16

Adam loses $16."

"To find the probability of both tickets being winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected.

Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find out how many Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27.

Now, we know that Carlos collected 22 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, we can divide 22 by 2 to find out how many Carrey collected.
22 / 2 = 11

Now that we know how many seashells each person initially collected, we can add them up to find the total number of seashells.
27 + 22 + 11 = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally between themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, and there are 8 babies in total, 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple. 

1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, so 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows, and 2 babies wearing purple also wear bows, we can assume that the remaining 2/3 of the purple wearers do not wear bows. 

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (babies wearing purple and bows) + 2/3 * 6 (babies wearing purple but not bows) = 2 + 4 = 6.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The probability is the number of babies wearing purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, which is 2/6 or 1/3 or approximately 33.33%."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on all days = 5168

Total reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on all days - (Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Total reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from selling his land.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. He received $50 for this sale.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. He received $30 for this sale.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he received 20 * $3 = $60.

Abraham received $50 + $30 + $60 = $140 in total.

The final answer is 140."
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
6 * 2 = 12

"To find the total number of eggs found, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person found and add them together.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs found by each person:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

Since there were initially 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value: 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, subtract the number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs:
36 (initial eggs) - 27 (eggs found) = 9 eggs

The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, he collects garbage 3 * 1440 = 4320 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so he makes 4320 * 0.40 = $1728 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so R = 4B.

Since the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, we can write the equation: Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so she was left with 15 - x, where x is the amount she gave away. We know that she was left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

To solve for x, we can multiply 4/5 by 15:

15 - x = 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So Rissa gave away $3. 

Now, we know that Rissa was left with 12 dollars. Since she gave away $3, she had 15 - 3 = 12 dollars initially. 

Since Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave away $3. 

Ronnie was given $5 initially, so she has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half must be the remaining three colors (red, white, and purple). 

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the total amount of paint used by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

12 pints / 3 = 4 pints per color

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of the remaining three colors. 

4 pints * 2 = 8 pints of yellow paint

Now, we need to find the amount of red paint. We already know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and 8 pints are yellow. 

12 pints - 8 pints = 4 pints of red paint

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

On Thursday, she counted 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counted 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the total number of clouds:

"To find the number of cycles, we first need to find the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20% of 100)
= 100 + (0.20 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Now, we can divide the budget of $1 by the cost of one pod to find the number of cycles:

Number of cycles = $1 / $0.10 (since the cost of one pod is $0.10)
= 10 cycles

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

2.25 = 0.20 * x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.20.

x = 2.25 / 0.20
x = 11.25

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The teacher will have 11 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk."

James drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more, so he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total. 

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500) to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Now, we can divide the total number of sets by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 sets / 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out the total number of books per school.

18 sets per school * 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend ate and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend ate 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices. 
6 cheese pizza slices + 4 pepperoni pizza slices = 10 slices per friend.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 slices per friend * 6 friends = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. 
To find out how many of each pizza Kate needs, we divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 5 cheese pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 60 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 7.5 pepperoni pizzas

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices for her friends."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

So, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. 
Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To find out how much Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount for each task and then add them together.

- Dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00
- Laundry: 1 time * $3.00 = $3.00
- Cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50
- Taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50

Jason earned $8.00 in a two-week period."
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we need to first find out how much blood a shark has. 

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we multiply 40 by 3 to get the amount of blood a shark has: 
40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we multiply the amount of blood a shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood ten sharks have:
120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Number of red pens: 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 red pens

"To find the total cost, we first need to find the number of bottles of cognac John bought. Since he bought twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he bought 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since the cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: 1.67"
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 'x'. 

The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. According to the problem, this expression equals 40. 

So, we can set up the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is 5/11 * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the first floor and then the height of the roof.

The height of the house is 7 times Mattison's height, which is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the height of the house is 420 inches, and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the house and the height of the second floor, which is 420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left. 

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group to finish. Since they can't try the escape room until the next group is done, the total time required will be the time for the 3 full groups plus the waiting time for the remaining 6 students.

The waiting time for the remaining 6 students is 45 minutes (since they can't try the escape room until the next group is done). 

So, the total time required is:
135 minutes (for 3 full groups) + 45 minutes (waiting time for the remaining 6 students) = 180 minutes

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The final answer is: 250"
"To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each shelf can hold: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total number of books: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the total number of books each bookcase can hold. 

Each bookcase can hold 45 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide 110 by 45. 

110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs
Cost per dozen = $2.40
Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozens
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Total revenue = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per sale = 20 sales
Total revenue = 20 * $1 = $20

Now, let's find the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats: 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 red hats.
2. Then, we subtract the number of red hats from the total: 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.
3. Next, we find the number of blue hats: 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test.

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct to pass, we need to find 70% of the total questions (70 + 40 = 110 questions).
70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right.
77 - 42 = 35 questions.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To find the number of blueberry cubes, we need to first determine the number of strawberry cubes. Let's call the number of strawberry cubes 'x'. 

Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can write an equation:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Since the total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, we can write another equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, let's break down the events:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make, we need to break down the process into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to get 15 customers, he would need to make 15 * 25 = 375 telephone calls.

However, for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason would need 15 * 2 = 30 customers.

Since Jason gets 1 customer for every 25 calls, to get 30 customers, he would need 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides take twice as long, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The last two sides take half as long as the first, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.
- The total time for the first 5 sides is 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.

Since the last side takes the same amount of time as the first side, the total time for the Rubik's cube is 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.

"To find the total number of items, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 20 * 2
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 footballs, we can find the number of robots:
Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation: 
20 = (1/2) * y, where y is the number of robots.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2:
y = 20 * 2
y = 40

Now that we know there are 40 robots, we can find the total number of items:
Total items = 20 (helmets) + 40 (robots) + 40 (footballs)
Total items = 100

The total number of items Dominick saw is 100."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total minutes he spends on calls per day. 

6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day

Since there are 5 days in a work week, we multiply the daily minutes by 5:

360 minutes/day * 5 days = 1800 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes):

1800 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

The new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the total amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

4 plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.
8 plants need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
The rest of the plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.
Since these plants need a quarter of a cup of water, that's 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the total amount of water needed: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time spent on land and the time spent in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Time spent on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time spent on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time spent on land = 5 minutes

Time spent in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time spent in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time spent in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on land + Time spent in water

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop, so 60 kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 170 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need twice the amount of lemon juice, so we multiply the number of lemons by 2:
30 lemons * 2 = 60 lemons

So, Tim will need a total of 30 + 60 = 90 lemons.

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Now, we know the ages of all the siblings: 
- 2 brothers: 12 and 24 years
- 3 sisters: 16 years each

Total age of the siblings = 12 + 24 + (3 * 16) 
= 12 + 24 + 48
= 84 years

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is 15 * 2 = 30 minutes.

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks is 30 * 28 (since there are 28 days in 4 weeks) = 840 minutes.

The total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric used, we need to calculate the total area of each type of shirt and add them together.

For small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
For medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
For large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total area of each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The quilt will be 101 square feet."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds for the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small and large sunflowers: 36 (small) + 54 (large) = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we multiply 18 by 3.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 2 * 36"" = 72"" tall.

Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, Jackie is 72"" - 2"" = 70"" tall.

We know Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so to find her height before the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height. 

Jackie's height before the summer = 70"" - 3"" = 67"""
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
- Original price of each T-shirt: $8
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16
- Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.
- The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4
- The price of the second T-shirt after the discount is $8 - $4 = $4
- The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12

For the shoes:
- Original price of the shoes: $40
- Jake buys the shoes at 40% off, so the discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16
- The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week and did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: $13 / $6.50 = 2.

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

"To find the cost of the ingredients for one jar, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients.

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of ingredients for one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's calculate the profit for one jar:
Profit per jar = Selling price per jar - Total cost per jar
Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit for 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
Total profit = Profit per jar * 10
Total profit = $6 * 10
Total profit = $60

"To find the total dollar amount, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

- 32 quarters = 32 * $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 * $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 for each of the two movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. 
Total amount spent = $3.50 + $7.50 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $28

Janet's parents gave her $40. 
Amount left = $40 - $28 = $12

Janet has $12 left."
"To find out how many days Josh is open in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks, excluding Sunday and Wednesday.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are 14 days. Excluding Sunday and Wednesday, Josh is open 14 - 2 = 12 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, he services 3 * 12 = 36 cars in 2 weeks.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so he earns 36 * 4 = $144 in 2 weeks.

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, let's break down the events:

- Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
- He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies, 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies.
- He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.
- He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies.
- He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies.

Randy now has 6 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, beakers as B, and Petri dishes as P.

We know that:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
- Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
- Igor had the correct number of beakers, so B = 7.

The total number of items on the lab bench is 29, so we can write the equation:
T + B + P = 29
8 + 7 + 16 = 31

However, we know that the total number of items is 29, not 31. This means that Igor lost some beakers. To find out how many, we need to subtract the total number of items he gathered from the total number of items Dr. Grumpus requested.

The total number of items Dr. Grumpus requested is 16 + 7 + 14 = 37. Since Igor gathered 31 items, he lost 37 - 31 = 6 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's assume Aaron's speed is x miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is x/2 miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is x/2 miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = (x/2) * time

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is x miles per minute, we can set up the equation:

4 = x * 16

Now we can solve for x:

x = 4 / 16
x = 1/4 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's time:

Vanessa's speed = x/2 = (1/4) / 2 = 1/8 miles per minute

Time = distance / speed
Time = 4 / (1/8)
Time = 4 * 8
Time = 32 minutes

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Selling price = $80 + $20
Selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.
