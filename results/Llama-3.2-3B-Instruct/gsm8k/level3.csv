"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins per day, but we don't know how many eggs are in each muffin. However, we can assume that each muffin is made with 1 egg. So, she bakes 4 eggs per day.

Now, subtract the eggs she bakes from the remaining eggs: 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. So, she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to add the number of blue bolts and white bolts.

Blue bolts: 2
White bolts: 2 * 0.5 = 1

Total bolts: 2 + 1 = 3"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

The total amount Josh invested is $80,000 (initial price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

The profit is the new value minus the total amount invested: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance per sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs per week is 180."
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to add the feed given in the morning and afternoon.

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups

Total feed so far: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed, we need to divide the total feed by 3 to find out how much feed each chicken needs.

40 cups / 3 chickens = 13.33 cups per chicken

Since we can't give a fraction of a cup, we'll round down to 13 cups per chicken.

Now, we multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken needs:

20 chickens * 13 cups = 260 cups

So, Wendi needs 260 cups of feed for her chickens in the final meal of the day.

Final answer: 260"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass, then add them together.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first 15 glasses (which are full price) and the cost of the 16th glass (which is 60% of the price).

Cost of the first 15 glasses: 15 * $5 = $75
Cost of the 16th glass: 0.6 * $5 = $3

Total cost = $75 + $3 = $78

The final answer is: $78"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep each city has.

Seattle has 20 sheep.

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep each city has: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To calculate the total download time, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial download and the restart.

1. Initial download: 
   - Total size of the file: 200 GB
   - Download speed: 2 GB/minute
   - Time taken for the initial download: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

2. Restart and initial download:
   - Time taken for the restart: 20 minutes
   - Remaining size of the file after the restart: 200 GB - (2 GB/minute * 20 minutes) = 200 GB - 40 GB = 160 GB
   - Time taken for the second download: 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes

Total time taken: 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 80 minutes = 200 minutes

The total time taken to download the file is 200 minutes."
"To calculate the total distance traveled, we need to break it down into three segments:

1. The first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

2. The 2 hours of standstill traffic:
Since he didn't move, the distance is 0 miles.

3. The 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes) at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

4. The remaining 2.5 hours (4 hours - 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 2.5 hours = 200 miles

Now, we add up the distances:
Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 200 miles = 395 miles

So, John is 395 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, we need to calculate her overtime rate first:
Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour

Then, we calculate the overtime hours worked:
Overtime hours = Total hours worked - 40 hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Now, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:
Overtime earnings = Overtime hours * Overtime rate = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

Month 1: 60 downloads
Month 2: 3 times the downloads of Month 1 = 3 * 60 = 180 downloads
Month 3: 30% of Month 2 downloads = 30% of 180 = 0.3 * 180 = 54 downloads

Now, let's add the downloads for all three months:
60 + 180 + 54 = 294 downloads

The total downloads over the three months is 294."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together:
$204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the annual profit.

Annual profit = Revenue - (Cost of tree + Cost of maintenance)
Annual profit = (7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon) - ($90 + $3)
Annual profit = $10.50 - $93
Annual profit = -$82.50

Since the annual profit is negative, it means that for the first year, Carlos will incur a loss. 

However, we can calculate the break-even point, which is the point at which the annual profit becomes zero.

Break-even point = Total cost / Annual profit
Break-even point = $90 / $82.50
Break-even point = 1.1 years

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take 2 years for Carlos to break even.

However, the question asks when he starts earning money. Since the annual profit is negative for the first year, Carlos will start earning money in the second year.

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she had 2 times the number of vacuum cleaners at the orange house. So, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

At the orange house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners than at the green house. Since she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, let's say she had x vacuum cleaners at the green house. Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left at the green house.

We know that the total number of vacuum cleaners at the green house plus the ones she sold at the orange house is equal to the total number of vacuum cleaners she had initially. We also know that she had 10 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = initial number of vacuum cleaners

We also know that she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. Since she had 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left at the green house, we can set up another equation:

2x/3 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 5 * 3/2
x = 7.5

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of vacuum cleaners:

initial number of vacuum cleaners = x + 10
= 7.5 + 10
= 17.5

The final answer is: 17.5"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 
   20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after subtracting those enrolled in contemporary dance:
   20 - 4 = 16 students

3. Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in jazz dance:
   25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

4. Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   16 - 4 = 12 students

5. Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60%"
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the distances covered by both trains: 80 + 80 = 160 miles.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Again, we add the distances covered by both trains: 150 + 150 = 300 miles.

Now, we add the distances covered in both parts to find the total distance covered by each train: 160 + 300 = 460 miles.

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 460 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week = $700 per week
$700 per week * 50 weeks per year = $35,000 per year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
$30 per hour * 15 hours per week = $450 per week
$450 per week * 50 weeks per year = $22,500 per year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching:
$35,000 per year + $22,500 per year = $57,500 per year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs per day, we multiply the number of eggs per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks have 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Total eggs in 4 weeks = 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

Total dozens of eggs = 84 eggs / 12 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can set up an equation to find the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average speed.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to achieve her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is:
10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
15 * (3/5) = 9 liters

Now, we add the amount of water in both drinks:
20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = (27 + 20)/3 = 47/3 liters

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water:
47/3 - 1 = 44/3 liters

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 44 by 3:
44/3 = 14.67 liters

The final answer is 14.67."
"To find the answer, we need to know the age of Raymond. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Samantha's age - Raymond's age = 31 - (31 - 6) 
= 31 - 25
= 6

So, Raymond is 6 years old.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age of the son, we subtract 23 from Raymond's age:

Raymond's age - son's age = 6 - 23
= -17

Since we can't have a negative age, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's re-examine the information given. We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31. This means Raymond is 25 years old (31 - 6). 

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age of the son, we subtract 23 from Raymond's age:

Raymond's age - son's age = 25 - 23
= 2

So, Raymond's son is 2 years old.

To find how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from the current year. However, we don't know the current year. We can assume the current year is 2024 (since we are using the knowledge cutoff date of December 2023). 

2024 - son's age = 2024 - 2
= 2022

Therefore, Raymond's son was born in 2022.

The final answer is: 2022"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

- The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
- The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
- The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by (1 - discount percentage). 

Discount percentage is 25%, which is 0.25 in decimal form. 

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - discount percentage)
= $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $25.80

The original price of the book was $25.80."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes she ordered is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and then multiply that by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 
60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance he traveled before the first stop from the distance he traveled before the second stop.

He traveled 20 miles before the first stop.
He traveled 60 - 20 = 40 miles before the second stop.

Now, we need to find the distance between the first and second stops. Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we can subtract 15 miles from the distance he traveled before the second stop.

40 - 15 = 25

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the cost of the second pair of heels is 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. This can be written as:

33 + 66 = B - 5

Combine the costs of the heels:
99 = B - 5

Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate B:
99 + 5 = B
104 = B

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's and Allen's current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a constant.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average, we need to first calculate the actual number of jelly beans each person guessed.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person said 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60.

The third person said 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. So, 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we have the actual numbers: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3: 
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use the information given. Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30:

x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as S, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Raymond has as R.

We are given that:
1. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron: S = A - 2
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels: A = (R/2) + 5
3. Raymond has 40 jewels: R = 40

We can substitute the value of R into equation 2 to find A:
A = (40/2) + 5
A = 20 + 5
A = 25

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = A - 2
S = 25 - 2
S = 23

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

23"
"To find the total points scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points.

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, let's add the points scored in both parts:
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of 1 yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John has after selling the Lego sets:
   13 Lego sets * $15 each = $195

2. Calculate the total amount of money John spent on video games:
   8 video games * $20 each = $160

3. Calculate the total amount of money John has left:
   $195 - $160 = $35

4. Since John has $5 left, we can subtract this from the total amount of money he had after selling the Lego sets to find out how much he spent on the Lego sets:
   $195 - $5 = $190

5. Now, we can divide the amount he spent on the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set to find out how many Lego sets he sold:
   $190 / $15 = 12.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a Lego set, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we need to consider that John had 13 Lego sets initially and sold 12 of them. Therefore, he still has 1 Lego set left.

The final answer is 1."
"To find John's average speed, we need to first find the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance = 60 miles/week
Time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours/week

Since he runs 3 days a week, we can find his daily average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 60 miles / 6 hours
= 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of 4 times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

Let's assume the total time is 6 hours. So, the time spent running is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours, and the time spent walking is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled by Dana in 2 hours while running: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

And the distance traveled by Dana in 4 hours while walking: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

So, the total distance traveled by Dana in 6 hours is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the given information:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone. 

Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, we multiply 400 by 3 to get the distance with the gemstone: 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet) to find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Remaining pieces = 14

Pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

The final answer is 26."
"To find out how many grams you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you have left in your daily target. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving has 250 calories, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, you can eat 0.8 * 5 = 4 grams."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to first calculate the total revenue, total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Total cost = Number of pounds of beeswax and wicks * Cost per pound
Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he needs 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks
Total cost = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound
Total cost = $20.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the time it takes to write each article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of linear equations. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes in her purse.
2. She purchased a package of post-it notes, which we'll call x.
3. At work, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee, so she used 220 post-it notes.
4. After using 220 post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

To solve for x, we'll add 220 to both sides of the equation:

80 + x - 220 + 220 = 23 + 220
x = 243

So, the package of post-it notes Candice purchased contained 243 post-it notes.

243"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the red ties and then add it to the cost of the blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, and he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought:

Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:
Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so:
Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total cost of the red ties:
Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and red ties:
Total cost = Cost of blue ties + Cost of red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can multiply 4 feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length in inches by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces.

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

The final answer is 8."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of units in the building.

First, we find the total number of units in the building: 
15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units

Now, we calculate 3/4 of the total units:
3/4 * 120 units = 90 units

Since the building has 120 units in total, the number of unoccupied units is:
120 units - 90 units = 30 units

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:
Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes to travel back, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:
30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can set up an equation to find out how many toys he needs to remove:
1/2 * x = 7.5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:
x = 7.5 * 2
x = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue of both days:
$520 (Thursday) > $480 (Friday)
Thursday has higher revenue.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue of Friday from the revenue of Thursday:
$520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Initial lollipops = 30
Lollipops eaten = 2
Remaining lollipops = 30 - 2 = 28

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags Jean can fill.

Remaining lollipops / 2 = 28 / 2 = 14

Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops each.

28"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14):

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first find the remaining weight available for the boxes.

The total weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds.
The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

Remaining weight available for the boxes = Total weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
= 5000 - 3755
= 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the remaining weight available for the boxes by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight available for the boxes / Weight of each box
= 1245 / 15
= 83

The final answer is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total fees first. 

The 25% fee is calculated as 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00.

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the tip of $4.00 to the total fees, making it $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Finally, we add the original bill of $40.00 to the total fees and tip, resulting in $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the individual raspberries.

First, let's calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters:

120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

There are 187 raspberries in total."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so we can calculate that as:
20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5 oranges

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 7 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
25 (total oranges) - 7 (not good oranges) = 18 oranges

Therefore, there are 18 good oranges."
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the material and the construction cost.

Material cost: $500

Total cost so far: $500 + $800 = $1300

Now, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost.
Insurance cost: 10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost.
Total cost: $1300 + $130 = $1430

Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her pension is $50,000 per year.

For the remaining 10 years, her pension increases by 5% each year. 

Year 21: $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500
Year 22: $52,500 * 1.05 = $55,125
Year 23: $55,125 * 1.05 = $57,862.50
Year 24: $57,862.50 * 1.05 = $60,700.63
Year 25: $60,700.63 * 1.05 = $63,576.66
Year 26: $63,576.66 * 1.05 = $66,457.08
Year 27: $66,457.08 * 1.05 = $69,313.36
Year 28: $69,313.36 * 1.05 = $72,165.58
Year 29: $72,165.58 * 1.05 = $75,017.07
Year 30: $75,017.07 * 1.05 = $78,008.36

The total pension for the remaining 10 years is the sum of the individual years:
$52,500 + $55,125 + $57,862.50 + $60,700.63 + $63,576.66 + $66,457.08 + $69,313.36 + $72,165.58 + $75,017.07 + $78,008.36 = $609,111.80

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), the cost is $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the cost is 10% less than $140 per month. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the cost for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the costs of both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the total capacity of her tank and then divide it by the amount of gas she used for the last fill-up.

First, we know that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she used 4 gallons for the last fill-up, we can calculate the remaining capacity of the tank as follows:

Remaining capacity = Total capacity - Used capacity
Remaining capacity = 12 gallons - 4 gallons
Remaining capacity = 8 gallons

Now, we can calculate the total distance she can drive on a single tank by dividing the remaining capacity by the miles she traveled since the last fill-up:

Total distance = Remaining capacity * Miles traveled since last fill-up
Total distance = 8 gallons * 100 miles
Total distance = 800 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 800 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the hours spent each week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time. He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. 

So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

= 120

Now, we know that there are 120 boys and 60 girls, so the total number of students is:
Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls
= 120 + 60
= 180

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers:
Number of teachers = Total students / 5
= 180 / 5

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the amount she will use for the rest of the year.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days:
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Since the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, we need to find out how many days are left in a year. There are 365 days in a year, and 180 days have already passed, so:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

Now, let's calculate the amount of dog food used for the rest of the year:
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, we need to add the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days and the amount used for the rest of the year:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Cecilia will use:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

David's laundry = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can find Raymond's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x is the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The football team won 15 games."
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of shirts he has per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. So, the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations a year, the total number of shirts (and thus quilt blocks) is 11 years * 4 shirts/year = 44 shirts.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off.

The first time it rang 4 times.
The second time it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 
4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increase for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2: 
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3: 
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4: 
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5: 
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6: 
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7: 
Initial salary = $1062.9366
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8: 
Initial salary = $1169.23
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9: 
Initial salary = $1286.153
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10: 
Initial salary = $1414.7683
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683
Salary after 10 years = $1414.7683 + $141.47683 = $1556.24513

"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

Let's say Harald sold x copies of his record. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

The final answer is: 8,000"
"To find the number of gift bags needed, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will attend. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests: 16
Number of guests who don't show up: 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of guests who will attend: 16 - 4 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed:
Number of gift bags needed: 12

Since each gift bag costs $2, we can multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per bag:
Total cost: 12 * $2 = $24

The final answer is: $24"
"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount for adults and children separately.

Adults: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pets each person has.

We know Cindy has 4 pets.

Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we can add up the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. 

Let's denote Corey's age as C. Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, we can write an equation: 
C - 1 = 10
C = 11

Now that we know Corey's age, we can use the information that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. 
Amy's age = C - 2
Amy's age = 11 - 2
Amy's age = 9

We also know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. 
Jackson's age = Amy's age - 5
Jackson's age = 9 - 5
Jackson's age = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

Now, we know Gerald's original time was 36 seconds. Since his diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new time by multiplying his original time by 0.9 (1 - 0.1, or 90% of the original time):

New time = 36 * 0.9
New time = 32.4

So, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 32.4 seconds with his improved diet."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that there are two cats for every dog. Since the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we need to first find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total students = 200
Number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

9 - 6 = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find the number of tomatoes used, we need to first find the total number of ounces of tomatoes used. Since the sauce is 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, we can multiply 32 by 2 to get the total ounces of tomatoes used.

32 * 2 = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes used by 16 to find the number of cans used.

64 / 16 = 4

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans used by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes used.

4 * 3 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

Let's start with the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit. 

Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = Original number of cars - Number of cars that took an exit
Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5
Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = 25

Now, we know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam minus the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

Number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = Total cars that drove through the traffic jam - Number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes
Number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 25 - 20
Number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 5

"To find the total number of potted plants Mary already has, we need to multiply the number of window ledges by the number of potted plants on each ledge.

Total potted plants = 40 window ledges * 2 potted plants per ledge
Total potted plants = 80

Since Mary will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, we need to subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has.

Number of plants given away = 40 window ledges * 1 plant per ledge
Number of plants given away = 40

Number of plants remaining = Total potted plants - Number of plants given away
Number of plants remaining = 80 - 40
Number of plants remaining = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add the pages from all the textbooks.

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Since Solo has 4 more days to complete the reading, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of soda for dinner, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which it covers the distance.

The city is 42 miles across, and it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections there are in the city. 
42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.
14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the number of pieces Poppy places on the board, we need to calculate a quarter of 1000.

A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250.

Now, we need to find the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. 

1000 - 250 = 750.

Next, we need to find a third of the remaining 750 pieces.

A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250.

Now, we subtract the pieces her mom places from the remaining 750.

750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is 500."
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

First, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the dimensions of the box to get the inner dimensions:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Inner Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is 72."
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all the time to minutes. 

Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each = 60 minutes each
Wednesday: 30 minutes
Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 90 minutes
Friday: 2 hours = 120 minutes

Total time watched = 60 + 60 + 30 + 90 + 120 = 360 minutes

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total, we can set up the equation:

60 + 60 + x + 90 + 120 = 420 (where x is the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday)

Combine like terms:
270 + x = 420

Subtract 270 from both sides:
x = 150

So, Frankie watched 150 minutes of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday. To convert this to hours, we divide by 30:
150 / 30 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Total cost = $30.00

Now, let's calculate the cashback rewards:
Cashback per gallon: $0.20
Number of gallons: 10

Total cashback = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, let's subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost:

Total cost after cashback = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to calculate the area of each roll-up and then multiply it by the number of rolls.

Beatrice's roll-up: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-up: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls long = 42 roll-ups

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, the total number of roll-ups eaten is also 90.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2:

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then use it to calculate the total amount of water taken on.

First, we need to find the rate at which Julia rows. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Rate = 1.25 feet per second

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can set up a proportion to find the rate at which the boat takes on water.

Rate of water taken on = 2 liters / 10 feet
Rate of water taken on = x liters / 1.25 feet

Since the rate of water taken on is constant, we can set up the proportion:

2 liters / 10 feet = x liters / 1.25 feet

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 1.25 = 10x
2.5 = 10x
x = 2.5 liters / 10
x = 0.25 liters per foot

Now that we know the rate at which the boat takes on water, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by the time Julia reaches the shore. We know that the shore is 64 feet away, and the boat takes on 0.25 liters per foot.

Total water taken on = Rate * Distance
Total water taken on = 0.25 liters/foot * 64 feet
Total water taken on = 16 liters

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks as x.

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the equation:

6 * Brittany's phone capacity = 1800

To find Brittany's phone capacity, we divide both sides by 6:

Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks. We can set up the equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * x

Since we know Brittany's phone capacity is 300, we can set up the equation:

300 = 50 * x

To find x, we divide both sides by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover lumber, we need to calculate the cost of each type of board and add them together.

The 2 x 4 x 10 boards cost $10 each, and there are 10 of them, so the total cost is:
10 * $10 = $100

The 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each, and there are 5 of them, so the total cost is:
5 * $16 = $80

The total cost of the leftover lumber is $100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new selling price of each board is:
$10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:
10 * $15 = $150 (for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards)
5 * $15 = $75 (for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards)
Total revenue = $150 + $75 = $225

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $225 - $180

The number of vehicles in the initial containers = 2 * 5 = 10
The number of vehicles in the containers imported on the second day = 30 - 10 = 20

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day = 20 / 5

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4."
"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then calculate their current salaries.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)

To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can divide both sides by 1.3:
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary:
Adrien's current salary = Adrien's salary four years ago + 40% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + 0.4($40,000)
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's current salary = $56,000

Now, we can find their total salary four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
To find Lylah's current salary, we can multiply her salary four years ago by 1.4 (since her salary increased by 40%):
Lylah's current salary = 1.4(Lylah's salary four years ago)
Lylah's current salary = 1.4($30,769.23)
Lylah's current salary = $43,269.23

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, we add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

The total number of fruits they have is 27."
"To find the total hours Sadie slept, we need to break it down day by day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.
On Friday, she slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept 5 + 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day:
8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 29

The total hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 29."
"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

Distance covered in the first 3 hours: 
Speed = 10 miles/hour
Time = 3 hours
Distance = Speed * Time = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours:
Speed = 5 miles/hour
Time = 4 hours
Distance = Speed * Time = 5 * 4 = 20 miles

Total distance covered in 7 hours = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate that as follows:

Letters needing stamps = 60
One-third of the letters needing stamps = 60 / 3 = 20

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters.

Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many letters were in that pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the number of letters she put stamps on from the current number of letters in the pile.

Letters in the pile when Jennie began = Letters in the pile now - Letters put stamps on
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then she bought a package of 'x' spoons, so she had x spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2 spoons.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 12

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends, we need to add the number of friends Amy and Lily have.

Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends. So, Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

Now, we add the number of friends Amy and Lily have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The total number of friends they have together is 120."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a watermelon and an orange.

Let's denote the cost of a pepper as P, the cost of a watermelon as W, and the cost of an orange as O.

We are given that:
1. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs: W = 3P
2. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs: O = W - 5

We are also given that each pepper costs 15 dollars: P = 15

Now, we can find the cost of a watermelon:
W = 3P
W = 3 * 15
W = 45

Now, we can find the cost of an orange:
O = W - 5
O = 45 - 5
O = 40

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the items Dillon wants to buy:
Total cost = (4 * W) + (20 * P) + (10 * O)
Total cost = (4 * 45) + (20 * 15) + (10 * 40)
Total cost = 180 + 300 + 400
Total cost = 880

The final answer is: 880"
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on each patient and the total revenue from the patients, then subtract the total cost of the doctors' time.

Total time spent on each patient: 24 minutes
Total minutes per day: 500 patients * 24 minutes = 12,000 minutes
Total hours per day: 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients: 500 patients * $200 per hour = $100,000 per day
Total cost of doctors' time: 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000 per day

Profit: $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000 per day

The hospital makes $70,000 per day from these visits."

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 2 * 6 = 24 tickets.

Now, let's add the total number of tickets used:
12 (Pam's roller coaster tickets) + 24 (Fred's roller coaster tickets) + 24 (their luge tickets) = 60 tickets.

The total number of tickets used that day is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first find out how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, we multiply the miles walked on Monday by 6. 
6 * 4 = 24 miles walked on Tuesday.

Now, we know that Walt walked 41 miles in total from Monday to Wednesday. We already know he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 
To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked. 
41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles walked on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation:

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find one third of the total number of unicorns: 
   1/3 * 27 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

2. Then, we find two thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands:
   2/3 * 9 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"To find the total cost of the order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

2 subs at $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
2 cookies at $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's add the costs of the items together: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. To do this, we'll calculate 20% of $20.00: 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, add the delivery fee to the total cost: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, add the $5.00 tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"To find the total number of questions Mark completed, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test.

For the first test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, so he completed 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 6 hours, so he completed 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

The total number of questions Mark completed is 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions and the second test had 100 questions, the total number of questions is 75 + 100 = 175 questions.

To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions: 175 - 70 = 105 questions.

"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's say the number of blue gumballs is B and the number of pink gumballs is P.

We are given that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:

P = 4B + 22

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so B = 12.

Now, we can substitute B = 12 into the equation:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of bees. 

Let's say the number of queens is Q, the number of baby bees is B, and the number of worker bees is W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Now we can substitute the expressions for W and B into the total equation:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Now we can substitute the expression for B into this equation:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Now we can solve for Q:

Q = 700 / 7
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:

B = 2Q
B = 2(100)
B = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees:

W = 2B
W = 2(200)
W = 400

Total non-food cost: $3 + $4 = $7

Now, we need to calculate the tax on the non-food items. 
Tax = 10% of $7
Tax = 0.1 * $7
Tax = $0.70

Now, we add the tax to the non-food cost.
Total non-food cost with tax: $7 + $0.70 = $7.70

Now, we add the total food cost and the total non-food cost with tax to get the total cost.
Total cost = $8 + $7.70 = $15.70

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours.
30 bees left in the first 6 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the number of bees that returned in the next 6 hours.
1/2 of 30 bees is 15 bees. So, 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bees that left the hive in the next 6 hours.
Two times the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Step 4: Calculate the number of bees that had already returned by the end of the second 6 hours.
15 bees had returned by the end of the second 6 hours.

Step 5: Calculate the number of bees that left in the third 6 hours.
60 bees left in the third 6 hours.

Step 6: Calculate the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours.
Since 30 bees had left initially and 15 had returned, 30 - 15 = 15 bees were still outside. Then, 60 bees left in the third 6 hours, so 15 + 60 = 75 bees were outside. 15 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

"To determine the winner and the waiting time, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home.

First, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet. 

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards.

Let's start with the last step: Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. This means that before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

Next, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon's theft x. Then, the raccoon stole 2/3x fries. So, the remaining fries after the raccoon's theft would be x - 2/3x = 1/3x. We know that this equals 6, so we can set up the equation 1/3x = 6 and solve for x. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 18.

Now that we know there were 18 fries before the raccoon's theft, we can find out how many fries were there before the pigeons ate 3 fries each. Since the pigeons ate 3 fries each, they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. So, before the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

Next, we need to find out how many fries were there before the seagull ate half of them. Let's call the number of fries before the seagull's theft y. Then, the seagull ate 1/2y fries. So, the remaining fries after the seagull's theft would be y - 1/2y = 1/2y. We know that this equals 27, so we can set up the equation 1/2y = 27 and solve for y. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get y = 54.

Finally, we know that Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack. So, the initial number of fries in the pack is 54 + 14 = 68.

The final answer is: 68"

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each item to feet:
- Each roll is 4 inches long, so 300 rolls will be 300 * 4 = 1200 inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 1200 inches is equal to 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, so 120 croissants will be 120 * 6 = 720 inches. Converting to feet, 720 inches is equal to 720 / 12 = 60 feet.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long, so 60 baguettes will be 60 * 2 = 120 feet.

Now, let's add the lengths of all the baked goods together: 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods will be 280 feet."
"To find the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for each type of ape and then add them together.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add the total number of bananas required for each type of ape:

"To calculate the distance traveled by Blake, we need to multiply the number of times he runs back and forth by the length of the football field.

Blake runs 15 times, so the distance traveled by Blake is:
15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards

To calculate the distance traveled by Kelly, we need to calculate the distance she runs to the 40-yard line and back, and then multiply it by the number of times she does this.

The distance from the 0-yard line to the 40-yard line is 40 yards. Since she runs to the 40-yard line and back, the total distance she covers in one round is:
40 yards * 2 = 80 yards

Since she does this 34 times, the total distance traveled by Kelly is:
80 yards * 34 = 2720 yards

Now, we can compare the distances traveled by Blake and Kelly to determine the winner.

Blake's distance: 1500 yards
Kelly's distance: 2720 yards

Since Kelly's distance (2720 yards) is greater than Blake's distance (1500 yards), Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly runs than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance:
2720 yards - 1500 yards = 1220 yards

The winner runs 1220 yards farther than the loser."

Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 (20% of $41.47) = $49.76
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 (20% of $49.76) = $59.71
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 (20% of $59.71) = $71.65
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 (20% of $71.65) = $85.98
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 (20% of $85.98) = $103.18
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 (20% of $103.18) = $123.82
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 (20% of $123.82) = $148.58
Price after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 (20% of $148.58) = $178.30
Price after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 (20% of $178.30) = $213.96
Price after 28 months = $213.96 + $42.79 (20% of $213.96) = $256.75
Price after 30 months = $256.75 + $51.35 (20% of $256.75) = $308.10
Price after 32 months = $308.10 + $61.62 (20% of $308.10) = $369.72
Price after 34 months = $369.72 + $73.94 (20% of $369.72) = $443.66
Price after 36 months = $443.66 + $88.73 (20% of $443.66) = $532.39

"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others. 

Since one red car costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a red car as follows:
3 action figures = 1 red car
3 * $5 = $15
So, 1 red car costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of a red car and an action figure. We also know the cost of the doll is equal to the cost of 3 action figures. 
3 action figures = 1 doll
3 * $5 = $15
So, 1 doll costs $15.

Now, we have the costs of all the toys:
- 1 red car = $15
- 1 action figure = $5
- 1 doll = $15

To find the total cost of all the toys, we add their individual costs:
$15 (red car) + $5 (action figure) + $15 (doll) = $35

The total cost of all the toys is $35."
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. 

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself.

$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract that from her budget.

The total cost of the accessories is:
€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1423

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. 

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write the equation: 
S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2, respectively. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:
2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28
Combine like terms:
3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:
3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:
B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
S = 2B
S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to follow the given information. 

Let's denote the amount of money Ethel has as E. According to the problem, Jimmy has 2 more than twice the money Ethel has. This can be written as:

Jimmy's money = 2 * Ethel's money + 2
Jimmy's money = 2 * E + 2

We are given that Ethel has $8. So, we can substitute E with 8:

Jimmy's money = 2 * 8 + 2
Jimmy's money = 16 + 2
Jimmy's money = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, let's add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs

Mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four.

We are given that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

We are also given that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Lastly, we are given that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two's age is 16 + 3 = 19 years.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together: 
8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirty-two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to first calculate 50% of each minimum payment and then add it to the minimum payment.

For the student loans: 
50% of $300 = 0.5 * $300 = $150
Total student loan payment = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
50% of $200 = 0.5 * $200 = $100
Total credit card payment = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
50% of $500 = 0.5 * $500 = $250
Total mortgage payment = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up the total monthly payments:
Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500

To find the total yearly payment, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total yearly payment = $1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and add it to the time it takes to cut one potato.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, we need to convert the time to peel one potato into seconds: 
1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds

Now, we can add the time to peel and cut one potato:
90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by 60:
95 seconds * 60 = 5700 seconds

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert the total time to minutes:
5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: 95"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's start by calculating the total revenue. They sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass costs $0.50, so the total revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, we can set up the equation:

Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$10 - Total Cost = $25

Now, we need to find the total cost. We know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Since they make $10 per gallon, the total cost per gallon is $5. To find the total cost, we can multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons they made. However, we don't know the number of gallons they made. Let's call the number of gallons 'x'. Then, the total cost is $5x.

Now we can set up the equation:

$10 - $5x = $25

To solve for x, we can add $5x to both sides of the equation:

$10 = $25 + $5x

Subtracting $25 from both sides:

-$15 = $5x

Dividing both sides by $5:

-$3 = x

Since we can't have a negative number of gallons, this means that the initial assumption of x being the number of gallons is incorrect. However, we can still solve for the total cost.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the total revenue is $25 and the profit is $25. This means that the total revenue is equal to the total cost. Since the total revenue is $10 per gallon, we can divide the total revenue by $10 to find the number of gallons:

$25 / $10 = 2.5 gallons

Since we can't have a fraction of a gallon, this means that they made 2 gallons of lemonade.

Now we can find the total cost:

Total Cost = Total Revenue
Total Cost = $25

Since the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, the total cost is $5 * 2 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the number of Chinese team members, we first need to find the total number of Chinese team members. 

We know that there are 240 participants in total, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Total number of Chinese participants - Number of boys on the Chinese team
= 160 - 60
= 100

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much Zaid has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = (1/4) * 6000 = 1500

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
   1/3 of 6000 = (1/3) * 6000 = 2000

3. Calculate the total amount spent so far:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crabs each person has and then add them together.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Jean's age as J, Mark's age as M, and Jan's age as A.

We are given that:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark: J = M + 2
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age: M - 2 = (A - 2)/2

We are also given that Jan is 30 years old: A = 30

Now, we can substitute A = 30 into the second equation:
M - 2 = (30 - 2)/2
M - 2 = 14
M = 16

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age:
J = M + 2
J = 16 + 2
J = 18

So, Jean is 18 years old.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the time taken by the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time taken by each of their runners.

The first runner takes 60 seconds.
The second runner will be 3 seconds faster, so they take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner will be 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner will be 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we need to find the total time taken by the less well-rounded team. 
Total time = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The faster team takes 55 seconds per runner, so their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3, and then subtract that from 1.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (1, 2, and 3) out of 6 possible outcomes.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1 - 3/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6, since the rolls are independent. 

So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

Now, we can find the difference in probabilities: 
(1/2) - (1/4) = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

Final answer: 25%"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first find out how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's apples as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples to find the total number of apples picked:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations.

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'x'. Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is 3x.

The total number of straw used for rats is 6 * 3x = 18x.

The total number of straw used for hamsters is 5 * 10 = 50.

The total number of straw used for rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw used is 160. So, we can set up the equation:

18x + 50 + 20 = 160

Combine the constants on the left side:

18x + 70 = 160

Subtract 70 from both sides:

18x = 90

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 5

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of the bags of wheat. Let's assume the trader bought 'x' bags of wheat.

The total cost of the bags of wheat = Cost of the bags + Cost of transportation
= 20x + 2x
= 22x

The total revenue from selling the bags of wheat = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
= 30x

The profit made by the trader = Total revenue - Total cost
= 30x - 22x
= 8x

We are given that the profit made by the trader is $400. So, we can set up the equation:

Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

Total cost of rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102.00

To find the cost per person, we need to divide the total cost by the number of people.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher and then calculate the total amount he earns.

Let's say the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher is x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, the total number of sentences he edits is 2x.

We know that the total number of sentences Mark edits is 1000, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 1000

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 1000 / 2
x = 500

So Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

We know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the amount he earns from Publisher A is:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, the amount he earns from Publisher B is:

2 * 2500 cents = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts he earns from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. 
So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets in a day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total annual salary, we need to calculate his weekly salary, then multiply it by 52 (the number of weeks in a year), and finally add the one-time award.

Weekly salary: $2000
Annual salary (before award): $2000 * 52 = $104,000
5% raise: $104,000 * 0.05 = $5,200
New annual salary: $104,000 + $5,200 = $109,200
Adding the award: $109,200 + $5,000 = $114,200

The final answer is: $114,200"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons per acre, and then multiply that by the number of barrels per ton.

First, we multiply the number of acres by the number of tons per acre: 
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Then, we multiply the total tons by the number of barrels per ton: 
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

The farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. 
7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. 
Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

He used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add the slices used for each meal together:
14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices

The total number of slices of cheese Carl used is 31."
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of pens in the blue bags:
6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of pens in the red bags:
2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add the number of pens Janet already had to the number of pens she bought:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens = 32 pens
32 pens + 54 blue pens = 86 pens
86 pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the required score, we need to first find the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. 

Since there are 6 tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first 5 tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs, we subtract the lowest score from the total required score: 558 - 71 = 487.

Now, we subtract the sum of the remaining 4 scores from the total score Brinley needs: 487 - 358 = 129.

This is the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

129"
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break it down into two parts: 

Part 1: Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
Distance = 5 * 25 * 4 = 500 kilometers

Part 2: Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. 
Distance = 2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Total distance = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's start by finding the total cost of half a dozen plates:
Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Total cost of 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 6 plates. 
20 dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups
Let's denote the cost of one cup as 'x'. 
So, the total cost of 240 cups = 240x

We are given that 240x = 36000 - 1200
240x = 34800

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 34800 / 240
x = 145

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is:
$30 + $20 = $50

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn:
$50 - $10 = $40

Since she earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session, we need to find out how many sessions she needs to complete to earn $40.

Let's assume she mows the lawn x times. She earns $4x per session. To earn $40, she needs:
$4x = $40

To find x, we divide both sides by 4:
x = $40 / $4
x = 10

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to earn $40.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations. Let's use 'r' to represent the number of red chickens and 'w' to represent the number of white chickens.

Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can write an equation:

w = r + 2

We know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, we can write another equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Now we can substitute the expression for w from the first equation into the second equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we need to add up the lengths of all its sides. Since it's a rectangle, we have two pairs of equal sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed
Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the number of customers on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in each pool decreases by 4 gallons every minute. 

After 4 minutes, the small pool will have x - 4*4 = x - 16 gallons, and the big pool will have 2x - 4*4 = 2x - 16 gallons.

We are given that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So, the initial amount of water in the small pool was 24 gallons. 

Since the small pool is leaking at 4 gallons/minute, after 4 minutes, it will have 24 - 4*4 = 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn.

Total cost of shoes and belt = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt."
"To calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay, we first need to find the additional amount she borrowed, which is 10% of $2000. 

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth borrowed is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she pays in 12 months:

$165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount she paid from the total amount borrowed to find the remaining balance:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

The remaining balance will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current ages of Adrian and Zack.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. We add 3 to each of their current ages.

Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Now, we can find the average age of the three in three years by adding their ages and dividing by 3.

Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored.
251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

Jojo scored 54 points."

To find Robert's candies, we divide both sides by 2:
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies:
James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now that we know James has 33 candies, we can find the difference between John's candies and James' candies:

2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
4. Now, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
5. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries.
6. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
7. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.
8. Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given him 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

We know that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. We can set up an equation based on this information:

32 - 4 = 2x
28 = 2x

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

Total hours worked per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked for 5 weeks: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total amount charged without discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Discount amount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to add up all the expenses:

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag, then multiply that result by the cost per pound.

First, multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag:

Next, multiply the total weight by the cost per pound:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply her sister's cookies by 4. 
Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Calories difference = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:
30 boys - 3 girls = 27 boys

Therefore, there are 27 boys in the third class.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cougars Rick killed today.
Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars the previous night. 
So, the number of cougars Rick killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Step 2: Calculate the number of wolves Rick killed today.
Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed 12 cougars today.
So, the number of wolves Rick killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of animals Rick killed.
Rick killed 10 wolves the previous night, 12 cougars today, and 36 wolves today.
So, the total number of animals Rick killed is 10 + 12 + 36 = 58.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide.

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 = 0.3 * 30 = 9

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

Robert's rides = 4 * 21 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we first need to find the total number of cows in all 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Initially, 10 stalls have 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall will have 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, we need to find the total number of cows in 8 stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is 8 * 2 = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to find the total weight:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that the termites ate. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that the termites ate from the total weight to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"

The final answer is $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas Jamal has. 

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up an equation to find Jamal's apples: 
Let x be Jamal's apples
Andrea's apples = x + 8
52 = x + 8
x = 44

Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

The total number of fruits is the sum of apples and bananas:
Total fruits = 52 (Andrea's apples) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 100

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12 (since 2 cups are needed for a dozen cookies).

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. 
Total cookies = 36 + 30 = 66

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:
66 / 12 = 5.5

So Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find two thirds of the pennies, we need to multiply the total number of pennies by 2/3.

First, we need to convert the fraction 2/3 to a decimal: 2/3 = 0.67

Now, multiply the total number of pennies by 0.67:
9,300 * 0.67 = 6,201

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply the result by 0.01:
6,201 * 0.01 = 61.01

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $61.01."

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * 350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * 350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The total price of the house is $409,500. To find out how much more it is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total fees and subtract them from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, we need to find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes
Time to heat up the oil = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes

Now, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat up the oil.

Time to cook the chicken = 28 - 5 = 23 minutes

Now, we add the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken to get the total time.

Total time = 28 + 23 = 51 minutes

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of houses by the number of bedrooms per house and then multiply by the number of windows per bedroom.

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house = 6 bedrooms
6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows in the bedrooms

There are 4 additional windows in each house, so we multiply the number of houses by the additional windows per house:
2 houses * 4 windows per house = 8 additional windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows:
12 windows in the bedrooms + 8 additional windows = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 1/10 * 900 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we can find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette: 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, we can subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette to find the total number of stitches for the two sleeves: 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the two sleeves by 2: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add the lines from both scenes and the song: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on each type of snake.

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, we can find the total number of spots for each type of snake:
- Cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800 spots
- Mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100 spots

Now, we add the total number of spots for both types of snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length of the space between the topaz gemstones. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, and each is 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total length of the space between the gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch) to find the number of beads used.

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 * 4 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"Let's break down the information given:

Ali has 22 medals.
Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's call this number 'x'. We can set up the equation:

39 = 10x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9 times 10, which is 39.

The final answer is: 39"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars: 8 packets * 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars
2. Calculate the number of chocolate bars given to the adults: 4 adults * 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars
3. Calculate the remaining chocolate bars: 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars
4. Calculate the number of children: 8 children
5. Calculate the number of chocolate bars each child will get: 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child

The final answer is: 2"
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to first determine the total number of minutes she worked. 

She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she worked 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she paused for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes worked. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her hourly rate: 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is $75."
"To find the points of each player, we need to follow the given information:

1. Mike has 21 points.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
3. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's check if each player has over 20 points to get the extra point in the fourth round:
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83."
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to first determine how many oranges the sons washed.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges.
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges initially. So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of the activities done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on each day.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add up the total count of each activity for the two days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of the activities done in the two days is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the rice will last, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg). 

42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the number of crates he sold on each day.

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the number of crates he sold from his target to find the difference.

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent on the desk. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the total number of bids (including Carmen's) is 4. 

The bids are as follows: 
- The first bid is $200.
- The second bid is $250.
- The third bid is $300.
- The fourth bid is $350.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so her bids are $250, $300, and $350. 

To find the total cost of the desk, we add up all the bids: 
$200 + $250 + $300 + $350 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1650.

The final answer is: $1650."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total cost of the miles driven, then add the bonus.

Total miles driven per day: 30 miles (to work) + 30 miles (back home) = 60 miles
Total miles driven per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
Total miles driven per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Total cost of miles driven: 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year

Total bonus per year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year: $30,000/year (miles driven) + $1,800/year (bonus) = $31,800/year

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many minutes he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the combined time by 2.

2 x 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the folded paper.

When a piece of paper is folded in half, it creates two identical halves. 

- The left side of the folded paper will have pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32.
- The right side of the folded paper will have pages 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

Since each piece of paper is used twice (once on each side), we can calculate the total number of pieces of paper used by counting the number of pages on one side and multiplying it by 2.

There are 32 pages on one side of the folded paper. Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper used is 32 * 2 = 64.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how much Annika spent, we need to calculate half of $50 and add $10.

Half of $50 is $25. 
$25 (half of $50) + $10 (for rides) = $35

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15

Annika has $15 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Elise sold in the first year. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the current year is x/2.

We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We can set up the equation: x + x/2 = 200

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x = 400

Combine like terms: 3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3: x = 400/3
x = 133.33

So, Elise sold 133.33 books in the first year. Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to 133 books.

Now, we know that the number of books sold in the current year is x/2 = 133/2 = 66.5. Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to 66 books.

We know that each book sells for 20$, so the total amount of money earned in the first year is 133 * 20 = 2660.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is 66 * 20 = 1320.

The final answer is: 1320"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month.

First, we need to find out how many hours he worked in April. Since there are 30 days in April and he works 10 hours a day, we multiply 10 hours by 30 days:

10 hours/day * 30 days = 300 hours

Since he earns $10 per hour, we multiply 300 hours by $10:

300 hours * $10/hour = $3000

Now, we need to add the $300 bonus he gets for a good performance:

$3000 + $300 = $3000 + $300 = $3300

The final answer is: $3300"

"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we need to divide the total weight he loses by the number of weeks it takes him to lose that weight. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Sandy by the amount of weight Joey loses per week to find out how much weight Sandy loses per week. 

2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

Since Sandy loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, it will take her 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey."
"To find the total cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, we need to multiply the cost of one tub by 2.

2 * $13 = $26

To find the total cost of 4 packets of milk, we need to multiply the cost of one packet by 4.

4 * $0.5 = $2

Now, let's find the total cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

$26 + $2 = $28

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk would be $13 + $2 = $15.

To find the total savings, we subtract the original price from the new price.

$28 - $15 = $13

"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5, which is 15. 

Since the person drinks the serum every 3 days, they will grow an extra arm every 3 days. In 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Since the person drinks the serum every 5 days, they will grow an extra leg every 5 days. In 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is 5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased and subtract that from his total budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit.
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs each group eats in a week and then add them together.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
The rest of the family (2 people) eat 2 eggs each day, so they eat 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

In a week, the three people eat 9 * 7 = 63 eggs.
The rest of the family eats 4 * 7 = 28 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in a week is 63 + 28 = 91 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's denote Jane's age as J, Trent's age as T, and Quinn's age as Q.

We know that:
1. Trent is 5 years older than Jane: T = J + 5
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn: J = Q - 3
3. Quinn is 30 years old: Q = 30

We can substitute the value of Q into the second equation to find Jane's age:
J = 30 - 3
J = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age:
T = J + 5
T = 27 + 5
T = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's start by finding Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. 

Since six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can set up the equation: 
Noah's age 6 years ago = (1/2) * Cera's age 6 years ago
Noah's age 6 years ago = (1/2) * 40
Noah's age 6 years ago = 20

Now, we know Noah's age 6 years ago, so we can find his current age by adding 6 to his age 6 years ago:
Noah's current age = 20 + 6
Noah's current age = 26

Now that we know Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile six years ago. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah:
Population of Chile 6 years ago = 3000 * Noah's age 6 years ago
Population of Chile 6 years ago = 3000 * 20
Population of Chile 6 years ago = 60000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, we can set up the equation:
Population of Chile 6 years ago = (1/2) * Population of Chile now
60000 = (1/2) * Population of Chile now
Population of Chile now = 2 * 60000
Population of Chile now = 120000

The final answer is: 120000"
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of players on each team.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x.

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

Since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16 people.

Now, we need to find 1/4 of 8 people who had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2 people.

We subtract the 2 people with previous commitments from the 16 people who attended: 16 - 2 = 14 people.

"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store:
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to the store that had 50. 
   Total marbles = 20 (bought) + 50 (already in the store) = 70 marbles.

2. Then, find 2/5 times the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna:
   2/5 * 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8

3. Now, add the marbles his father gave him to the total:
   Total marbles = 70 (already in the store) + 8 (from his father) = 78 marbles.

4. Finally, calculate the total weight of the marbles:

Since the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10 to find the number of nongendered children:
30 * 1/10 = 3 nongendered children

Now, we can add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children:

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to represent this relationship:

Electric poles : Electric wires = 1 : 3

We know that the total number of electric wires is 45. Since the ratio of electric wires is 3, we can divide 45 by 3 to find the multiplier:

45 ÷ 3 = 15

Now, we can multiply the multiplier by the number of electric poles in the ratio (1) to find the total number of electric poles:

1 * 15 = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the beginning of the party, we need to add the number of men and women.

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, we can find the number of men who left:

Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Now, we know that 3 men left, and 10 people left in total. Since we know the number of men who left, we can find the number of women who left:

Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

Now, we can find the number of women left:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we need to add the pencils in the boxes and the loose pencils. Since we don't know the number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

We know that 3x + 2 = 26. To find 'x', we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 
3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24
Now, we divide both sides by 3:
x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has:
Total pencils = 3x + 2
Total pencils = 3(8) + 2
Total pencils = 24 + 2
Total pencils = 26

Now, we add the total pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has:
Total pencils = 26 + 46
Total pencils = 72

Since each box contains 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed:
Number of boxes = Total pencils / 8
Number of boxes = 72 / 8
Number of boxes = 9

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the initial temperature difference between the hot coffee and the desired temperature of the iced coffee.
Initial temperature difference = 65 degrees

Step 2: Calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:
Number of ice cubes = Initial temperature difference / Cooling per ice cube
= 65 / 13
= 5

Step 3: Calculate the total volume of the coffee after adding the ice cubes.
Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the total volume decrease is:
Total volume decrease = Number of ice cubes * 12 milliliters
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Step 4: Calculate the final volume of the iced coffee.
Initial volume of coffee = 65 degrees (no initial volume given, so we assume it's 1 unit for simplicity)
Final volume = Initial volume - Total volume decrease
= 1 - 60
= -59 milliliters

However, we also need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since the problem states that adding liquid weakens the coffee, we need to subtract the volume of cream from the final volume.
Final volume = Final volume - Volume of cream
= -59 - 15
= -74 milliliters

The negative sign indicates that the coffee is weaker, but we are only interested in the absolute value of the volume decrease.

The final answer is: 74"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios. Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

Let's say the 5 people brought x old records. Since they left with 7 new records, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 7 * 5 (since each person gets 5 new records)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 35

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 35/2
x = 17.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a record, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't have a fraction of a record, so we'll keep the answer as a fraction.

x = 17.5"
"To find the number of junior programmers, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total number of employees.

Total employees = 100
Junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can calculate the salary of a senior programmer as follows:
Junior programmer's salary = $2000
Senior programmer's salary = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:
Total junior programmers = 40
Total senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60
Total salary for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000
Total salary for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000
Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"To find the total number of lollipops Erin has, we need to add the initial number of lollipops she had to the number her mother gave her, then subtract the number she gave to Ella.

Initial lollipops: 7
Lollipops from mother: 10
Total lollipops: 7 + 10 = 17

Lollipops given to Ella: 3
Lollipops left: 17 - 3 = 14

Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"To find the total amount the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned: The customer spent $80 and gets $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. The total rewards are 4 * $1 = $4.

2. Apply the rewards: The customer used their rewards, so the price after rewards is $80 - $4 = $76.

3. Apply the coupon: The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off. The price after the coupon is $76 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To calculate the net income for Job A, we need to first calculate the total income and then subtract the taxes.

Total income for Job A: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
Total taxes for Job A: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
Net income for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

To calculate the net income for Job B, we need to subtract the property tax first, then calculate the taxes on the remaining income.

Net income for Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Taxes for Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
Net income for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B has a higher net pay rate.

To find the difference in net income between the two jobs, we subtract the lower net income from the higher net income: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate the number of ruined castles first. 

40% of 220 castles are ruins. 
40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Now, half of the ruined castles are unmanned. 
Half of 88 = 88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."
"To calculate the total cost of each offer, we need to add the advance payment to the total of the monthly installments.

Furniture United's total cost: 
Advance payment: $1,350
Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' total cost: 
Advance payment: $1,100
Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is: 
$3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The final answer is: $100"

"To calculate the final value of Maria's shares, we need to apply the percentage changes to the initial value.

Initial value of shares = 8 shares * $8 = $64

Increase in the first year = 50% of $64 = 0.5 * $64 = $32
New value after the first year = $64 + $32 = $96

Decrease in the second year = 25% of $96 = 0.25 * $96 = $24
Final value after the second year = $96 - $24 = $72

Final value of Maria's shares = $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to first find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

Now, we know John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

So, the smallest group has 40 students.

40"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. 

Let's say the number of cows is x. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh has, we need to calculate the number of balls he had before the talent show and then subtract the ones he lost.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. 

Week 1: 3 + 1 = 4
Week 2: 4 + 1 = 5
Week 3: 5 + 1 = 6
Week 4: 6 + 1 = 7

So, Josh has 7 balls before the talent show.

He loses 3 balls, but 2 are caught, so he loses 1 ball. 

7 - 1 = 6

Josh starts juggling on stage with 6 balls."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird.

Let's denote the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird as B, T, S, and R, respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle: F = B
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad: F = T
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake: F = S - 10
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird: F = R + 20

We are also given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds: F = 50

From the first equation, we can write: B = 50

From the second equation, we can write: T = 50

From the third equation, we can write: S = 50 + 10 = 60

From the fourth equation, we can write: R = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal: 
Total weight = F + B + T + S + R + container weight
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 240

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of outfits, we need to follow the order of operations.

1. Laurel initially received 24 baby outfits.
2. She received twice the amount of new outfits, which is 2 * 24 = 48.
3. Then, her mom gifted her with 15 more outfits.

"To find the new distance Tyson runs each day, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to 5000 meters.

1/5 of 5000 meters = 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters

New distance per day = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since June has 30 days, we multiply the new distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June.

Total distance in June = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the price of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B. To do this, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

Now, let's add the total number of legs: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, which has 36 cookies. So, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, first, we need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of 2 shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 
The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24. 

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $60 - $24 = $36.

Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the percentage change, we need to calculate the daily profit before and after the change.

Daily profit before: 10 tractors * $100/tractor = $1000
Daily profit after: 5 silos * $220/silo = $1100

To find the difference in daily profit: $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage change: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find the total monthly cost, we need to calculate the weekly cost of food and multiply it by 4, then add the monthly cost of treats and medicine.

Weekly cost of food: $25 * 4 = $100
Monthly cost of food: $100 * 4 = $400
Monthly cost of treats: $20
Monthly cost of medicine: $100

Total monthly cost: $400 + $20 + $100 = $520

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:

$520 * 12 = $6240

The final answer is: $6240"
"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

1. Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
2. Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga class, so it's 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
3. Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes).
4. Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
5. Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for all activities:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5."
"To find out how many plant pots April needs for the roses, we need to multiply the number of pots for the daisies by 2. 

30 (daisies) * 2 = 60 (roses)

Now, we add the number of pots for the daisies and roses to find the total number of pots needed. 

30 (daisies) + 60 (roses) = 90

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the number she already had. 

100 (initial pots) - 90 (total needed) = 10

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours
Total time spent on these activities: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since 30% of the total time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time:
0.3 * total time = 6 hours
total time = 6 / 0.3
total time = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing:
Time spent sightseeing = 40% of 20 hours
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 20
Time spent sightseeing = 8 hours

The final answer is 8."

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has left after buying the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the mini-golf and go-kart rides:
- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- 2 go-kart rides cost 2 * $10 = $20
- Total cost for mini-golf and go-kart rides = $5 + $20 = $25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from Morgan's budget:
- Morgan's budget = $90
- Total cost for mini-golf and go-kart rides = $25
- Remaining budget = $90 - $25 = $65

Since Morgan also wants to buy $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget:
- Remaining budget = $65
- Arcade tokens = $5
- Remaining budget after arcade tokens = $65 - $5 = $60

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost of each friend's activities (assuming each friend will play mini-golf, get arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts):
- Cost per friend = $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $10 (go-kart ride) = $20
- Number of friends = $60 / $20 = 3

Morgan can invite 3 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Now, subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards.

First, we know that Billy spent half of his change on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total amount he spent on gumballs is:
40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had initially is:
$2 * 2 = $4

Now, we know that Billy had $10 initially and spent $4 on gumballs, so the amount he had left is:
$10 - $4 = $6

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost per pound to find the number of pounds of candy he bought:
$6 / $1.5/pound = 4 pounds

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say Carver's son is x years old. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

2x - 5 = 45

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Then, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities.

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles

Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train makes 3 trips a day, the total distance it travels in a day is: 225 * 3 = 675 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 675 miles is less than 18,000 miles, so the train will need service after the first trip.

Therefore, the train will need service after 1 day.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to follow the given information:

- A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
- A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds.

First, we find the average amount of stuffing for a collie bed:
Average = (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds

Now, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the beds:
- 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
- 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds
- 1 Rottweiler bed: 8 pounds

Total amount of stuffing needed = 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 pounds

"To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home.

Total distance = Distance to friend's house + Detour + Distance back home
Total distance = 200 miles + 10 miles + 240 miles
Total distance = 450 miles

To find the time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

Time taken to reach friend's house = Distance / Speed
Time taken to reach friend's house = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time taken to reach friend's house = 2.86 hours

Time taken for detour = Distance / Speed
Time taken for detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for detour = 0.14 hours

Time taken to return home = Distance / Speed
Time taken to return home = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time taken to return home = 3 hours

Total time taken = Time taken to reach friend's house + Time taken for detour + Time taken to return home
Total time taken = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken = 5.99 hours

The trip took 5.99 hours."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x.

Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we have:
x = 3

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5:
Shoplifters = 4x - 5
= 4(3) - 5
= 12 - 5
= 7

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters:
Violence = 3(7)
= 21

The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence:
Total = x + Shoplifters + Violence
= 3 + 7 + 21
= 31

However, we are given that the total number of people kicked out is 50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
3 + 7 + 21 = 50

Since this equation is not true, we need to re-evaluate our previous steps. Let's re-examine the equation for shoplifters:
Shoplifters = 4x - 5

We know that the total number of people kicked out is 50, and we have already accounted for 31 people (3 for refusing to wear masks, 7 for shoplifting, and 21 for physical violence). This means that the remaining people must have been kicked out for other reasons:
Other reasons = Total - (Refusing to wear masks + Shoplifters + Violence)
= 50 - (3 + 7 + 21)
= 50 - 31
= 19

Now, we can set up an equation for the shoplifters:
7 = 4x - 5

Solving for x:
4x = 7 + 5
4x = 12
x = 3

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks:
Refusing to wear masks = x
= 3

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is:
Shoplifters = 4x - 5
= 4(3) - 5
= 12 - 5
= 7

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is:
Violence = 3(7)
= 21

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
Other reasons = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Erin's initial points are x. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can write the equation as:

x + 14 = 3(8)

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get:

x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14.

"To find the cost of the materials, we need to calculate 20% of the original price of the wallpaper.

20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

Since Ethan saved $80 by making his own wallpaper, we subtract this amount from the original price.

$400 - $80 = $320

The total cost of the materials for Ethan's DIY project is $320."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. The next day, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.
3. On the last day, they sold one-half the amount from the previous day, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.
4. However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total: 14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50.

The total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50."

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

40% of 400,000 is 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000.

So, the number of faulty pieces of equipment is 160,000.

The total number of pieces of equipment is 400,000.

The number of functioning pieces of equipment is 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000.

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is 240,000 * $400,000 = $96,000,000.

"To find out how many rolls Mrs. Sherman had left after feeding her 6 children, we need to subtract 6 from the initial 12 rolls.

12 (initial rolls) - 6 (children) = 6

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of rolls she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into. Since each roll was broken into 8 pieces, we multiply 6 by 8.

6 (remaining rolls) * 8 (pieces per roll) = 48

So, Mrs. Sherman broke the remaining 6 rolls into 48 pieces and fed them to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards.

We know that Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday. Since she sells apples at $4 per piece, we can divide $56 by $4 to find the number of apples she sold on Monday.

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Now, we know that Lucy picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday. Let's call the number of apples picked on Tuesday 'x'. Then, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is 2x.

We also know that the total number of apples picked over the three days is the sum of the apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. So, we can set up the equation:

14 (Monday) + x (Tuesday) + 2x (Wednesday) = Total apples

Since we know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday, we can substitute x = 12 into the equation:

14 + 12 + 2(12) = Total apples
14 + 12 + 24 = Total apples
50 = Total apples

Now, we know that Lucy picked 50 apples over the three days."
"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of pairs and the number of loose socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks she washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Now, let's find the number of socks Lindsay has missed. Initially, there were 50 socks. She has washed 35 socks. 

The number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

65 - 44 = 21

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to first calculate the total interest paid over the 5 months. 

The formula for simple interest is: 
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Since Karan has to pay the principal and the interest, the total amount she needs to pay is:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,105

The final answer is: $1,105"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances to see how much farther Cho hiked.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of silver pesos Axel has, we need to multiply the number of silver pesos he has by 2, since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel.

Axel has 50 silver pesos, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Now, let's add the number of gold pesos they have together. Axel has 80 gold pesos, and Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350.

Total revenue: 36 cups * $1 per cup = $36

Now, let's calculate the profit per hour. 
Number of hours the lemonade stand is open: 4 cups per hour
Total cups of lemonade sold: 36 cups
Total hours: 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = 9 hours

"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left, which is 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 12.8 * 2.5
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To calculate the cost of buying individual ride tickets for 9 rides, we need to multiply the number of rides by the cost per ticket: 
9 rides * $2 per ticket = $18

Since David buys a ride bracelet for $30, he doesn't need to buy any more tickets. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying tickets for Dasha. 
Dasha needs 9 tickets, so she needs to buy 9 / 2 = 4.5 tickets. Since you can't buy half a ticket, she needs to buy 5 tickets. 
5 tickets * $2 per ticket = $10

Now, let's calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha. 
David's cost: $30 (ride bracelet) 
Dasha's cost: $10 (5 tickets) 
Total cost: $30 + $10 = $40

To find out how much David saves, we subtract his cost from the total cost:

Now, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:
Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the savings, we need to first find the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but since he gets a 20% discount for bundling, the cost will be 80% of $10, which is $8 per month for both. 
So, the total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Now, let's calculate the savings by cancelling the cable package. 
The cost of the cable package is $60 per month. 
The cost of the streaming services is $18 per month. 
The savings will be $60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42 per month.

"To find the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had, we need to add the cards she made and the cards her dad brought her.

Erica made 20 cards.
Her dad brought 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
Total cards Erica initially had = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Now, let's calculate the cards she gave away and received.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
She gave 5 cards to her family.
She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Total cards given away = 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
Total cards received = 17 cards.

Now, let's calculate the net change in the number of cards Erica has.

Net change = Total cards received - Total cards given away
= 17 - 29
= -12

Since Erica gave away more cards than she received, the net change is negative. This means she has fewer cards now than she did initially.

To find the final number of cards Erica has, we subtract the net change from the initial number of cards.

Final number of cards = Initial number of cards - Net change
= 50 - 12

"To find out how many slices Jenny has initially, we need to add the fractions 1/3 and 1/4. 

First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 3 and 4, which is 12. 

Now, we convert both fractions to have the same denominator:
1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, we can convert this to a mixed number:
7/12 = 0 5/12

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract 2 from the initial amount:
0 5/12 - 2 = -1 1/12

Since we can't have a negative number of slices, we can convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:
-1 1/12 = -13/12

However, since we can't have a negative number of slices, we can say that Jenny has 0 slices left.

The final answer is 0."

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used in 30 days at the original usage rate.

Original energy usage per day: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)
Total energy usage in 30 days: 7200 Wh * 30 = 216,000 Wh

Now, let's calculate the new energy usage per day after reducing the usage time by 5 hours:
New energy usage per day: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

Total energy usage in 30 days at the new rate: 2700 Wh * 30 = 81,000 Wh

To find the energy saved, subtract the new total from the original total:
Energy saved in 30 days: 216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

Let's denote the number of cannolis as C and the number of corns as C/2 (since there is twice as much corn as cannolis).

We know that Allan has a total of 40 cannolis, so C = 40.

Now, we can find the number of corns: C/2 = 40/2 = 20.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new total of corns is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis: 100 + 60 = 160.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he completed before the jog from the total steps he wanted to take.

Elliott wanted to take 10,000 steps. He completed half of his steps, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. He also did 1,000 steps with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, we subtract the steps completed before the jog from the total steps Elliott wanted to take: 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps.

However, after the jog, Elliott had 2,000 steps left. This means that the steps he took during the jog are the difference between the steps he completed before the jog and the steps he had left. So, the steps he took during the jog are 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. 

Total amount paid in May = Number of employees * Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
Total amount paid in May = 40 * $15 * 40
Total amount paid in May = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees left. 
Number of employees in June = 3/4 * 40
Number of employees in June = 30

Total amount paid in June = Number of employees * Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
Total amount paid in June = 30 * $15 * 40
Total amount paid in June = $18,000

Total amount paid in the two months = Total amount paid in May + Total amount paid in June
Total amount paid in the two months = $24,000 + $18,000
Total amount paid in the two months = $42,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is $3."
"To find the total cost of the fireworks, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages first. 

The first package costs $400. 
The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The total cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. The total cost is $960 + $150 = $1110.

Next, we need to find the probability that a candle will explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, the probability of a candle exploding is 1 - 0.99 = 0.01.

Now, we can multiply the number of candles that smell like wet dog by the probability of a candle exploding to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode:

2500 * 0.01 = 25

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the regular price.

The regular price of each blouse is $20. Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total regular price is 4 x $20 = $80.

The discount is 30% of the regular price. To find 30% of $80, we multiply $80 by 0.30.

$80 x 0.30 = $24

Now, we subtract the discount from the total regular price to find the total cost of the discounted blouses.

$80 - $24 = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact amount is unknown.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'. Since her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered from the average trees is 'x'.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation:

30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) + 60 (sister's tallest) + 45 (sister's shortest) = 500

Combine like terms:

145 + x = 500

Subtract 145 from both sides:

x = 355

The final answer is: 355"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's use 'c' to represent the number of camels and 'd' to represent the number of dromedaries.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation:
c + d = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have 2 bumps each and dromedaries have 1 bump each, we can write the equation:
2c + d = 304

Now we have a system of linear equations:

c + d = 180
2c + d = 304

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate 'd':
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we have the value of 'c', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of 'd':
c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

In the next 2 days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.3:
800 km * 0.3 = 240 km

So, in the next 2 days, Tom traveled 240 km.

In the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip is 3140 km.

3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the following equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5 cubic inches

To find Zack's locker, we can multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to add the initial elevation of Stanley (10,000 feet) to the distance the comb fell (4,000 feet). 

10,000 feet + 4,000 feet = 14,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb (14,000 feet) and Oliver's current elevation (3,000 feet). 

14,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 11,000 feet

Oliver must climb 11,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial capital to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000
Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we calculate the number of cats taken away by the boats: 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.
2. Now, we subtract the cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the cats that ran away from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods:

1. The first 6 months at $8 per month: 6 months * $8 = $48
2. The next 2 months at $12 per month: 2 months * $12 = $24
3. The remaining 22 months at $14 per month: 22 months * $14 = $308

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $24 + $308 = $380

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $380."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, which is (1/3)x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is the rest, which is 2/3 of its original price, or (2/3)(x + 6).

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fractions:

x + 2(x + 6) = 18

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans, which is x + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8.

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is 8 - 2 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders. Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and each attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is:
3 * 20 = 60 birds

Next, let's calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders. Since each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. There are 3 homemade feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is:
3 * 30 = 90 birds

Now, let's add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders:
60 + 90 = 150 birds

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find the price of the soup, we need to calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price. 

25% of $4 is 0.25 * 4 = $1. 
The price of the soup is $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the prices of the soup, bagel, and cake together: 
$5 (soup) + $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Kenny has in total. We know that he has $50 in spending cash and he also gets to keep 1/3 of the cards, which means he gets 1/3 of the money from selling the cards. Let's assume the total number of cards is x.

Since Kenny sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is 1.5x.

We know that he keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells 2/3 of the cards. The amount of money he gets from selling 2/3 of the cards is 2/3 * 1.5x = 1x.

We also know that he has $50 in spending cash, so the total amount of money he has is 1x + 50.

Since the total amount of money he has is equal to the cost of the amusement park ticket ($100), we can set up the equation:

1x + 50 = 100

Subtracting 50 from both sides:

1x = 50

Dividing both sides by 1:

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. 

Since 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs, the remaining guests who only had one hotdog are:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

So, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of 6 letters is 6 / 2 = 3.

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we add 4 to 3. 
3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 
6 + 7 = 13.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - Pot and pans: $120.00

   - 5 utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the 20% discount:
   20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

3. Calculate the final cost after the discount:
   Final cost = Total cost - Discount
   Final cost = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: 
$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of:
$2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the money she has from the total cost:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (money she has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dragons each prince slew and then multiply that by the fraction representing the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. 
Three quarters of 100 is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. 
Twice 75 is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. 
One-fifth of 150 is 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many gallons in each container, we need to divide 15 gallons by 5 containers.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3 gallons to pints.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Now, we need to find 1/4 of 24 pints.

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of candy bars George bought as 'x'. Since he spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, he must have spent 99% of his money, which is $4.90.

We know that the cost of 3 bags of chips is 3 * 0.40 = $1.20. So, the remaining money after buying chips is $4.90 - $1.20 = $3.70.

Since each candy bar costs $0.75, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 3.70

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 3.70 / 0.75
x = 4.93 (round down to 4, since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar)

So, George bought 4 candy bars.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends, we need to subtract the number of lollipops he kept from the total number of lollipops he had.

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops kept) = 20

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops (20) by the number of friends (4) to find out how many each friend received.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

5"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people = 2

Since each person has one piece, we can divide the number of pieces by 2 to find the number of people who have a piece:
8 / 2 = 4

Now, we can subtract the weight of the 4 pieces from the total weight of the cake:
20 - 4 = 16

The remaining cake weighs 16 ounces."
"To find the total number of oranges, we need to add the oranges Sitti and Juris bought: 
34 + 22 = 56

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends), which is 8. 
56 ÷ 8 = 7

Everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the onions, we need to multiply the weight of the onions by the price per pound.

2 pounds of onions * $2.00 per pound = $4.00

Since Antoine likes to double the amount of onions, we multiply the cost by 2.

$4.00 * 2 = $8.00

Now, we need to find the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00.

2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost.

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Since the soup serves 6 people, we divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then subtract that from the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, we know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette should arrive 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

However, we need to consider the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 9 = 25 minutes before Wayne to arrive 9 minutes before him.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 25 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the width of the room, we need to divide the area by the length. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can find the width by dividing the area by the length: 
Width = Area / Length = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) 
Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature increase due to baking.
The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the total temperature increase is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Step 2: Calculate the initial temperature after baking.
The initial temperature is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature increases by 15 degrees, so the new temperature is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Step 3: Calculate the temperature decrease due to the window being open.
The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the total temperature decrease is 2 * (30 / 10) = 6 degrees.

Step 4: Calculate the final temperature.
The temperature after baking is 55 degrees. After the window is open, the temperature decreases by 6 degrees, so the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
James' swim time: 40 - (40 * 0.10) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

Jon's bike time: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
James' bike time: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Jon's run time: 50 minutes
James' run time: We don't know this yet, but we can call it x.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. 

Jon's total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes
James' total time: 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now we can set up an equation to solve for James' run time:
36 + 85 + x = 180
121 + x = 180
x = 59 minutes

So, James took 59 minutes to complete the run."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we multiply 1.25 by 60 to convert it to minutes: 
1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:
75 + 5 = 80 minutes

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4:
80 / 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is 20."
"To find the distance traveled, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

Time in hours = 30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Distance = Speed * Time = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30. 

Change = $30 - $24 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of eggs Rozanne has, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find the number of glasses. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find the number of trays. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

Marcy's points after scoring: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, let's find the difference between Joey's points and Marcy's points:
240 - 235 = 5

Joey is winning by 5 points."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each:
48 sneakers - 17 sneakers = 31 sneakers
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Total revenue - Total cost = $1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and then add them together.

For the six packets with eight colors each, we multiply 6 by 8:
6 * 8 = 48

For the four packets with sixteen colors each, we multiply 4 by 16:
4 * 16 = 64

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets:
48 + 64 = 112

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the price of popcorn as P and the price of a soda as S. 

We know that the super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda. So, the total cost of the super ticket is P + S + 1. We also know that the super ticket costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

P + S + 1 = 20

We also know that the regular ticket costs $12, and you can buy a popcorn and a soda at regular price. So, the total cost of the regular ticket is P + S. We also know that you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket is $2 less than the super ticket. We can set up the equation:

P + S = 20 - 2
P + S = 18

Now we have two equations:

P + S + 1 = 20
P + S = 18

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

S + 1 - (P + S) = 20 - 18
1 - P = 2
P = -1

However, the price of popcorn cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda. We also know that the regular ticket costs $12, and you can buy a popcorn and a soda at regular price. So, the total cost of the super ticket is P + S + 1, and the total cost of the regular ticket is P + S. We also know that you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket is $2 more than the super ticket. We can set up the equation:

P + S = 20 + 2
P + S = 22

Now we have two equations:

P + S + 1 = 20
P + S = 22

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

22 - (P + S) = 20 - 20
22 - (P + S) = 0
22 - P - S = 0
22 = P + S

Now we can solve for P by subtracting S from both sides:

22 - S = P

We know that the soda costs $3, so S = 3. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

22 - 3 = P
P = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original cost per balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost per balloon as x. Since 20 balloons cost $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20, so the new cost per balloon is:

45 + 20 = 65

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

65 * 170 = 11,100

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,100 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten, we need to multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

Marin eats 4 apples per day, and Nancy eats 4 apples per day. 
So, the total number of apples eaten per day is 4 + 4 = 8 apples.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples eaten per day by the number of days: 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

They eat 240 apples in 30 days."
"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to multiply the width, length, and height of each bed.

Volume of one bed = width * length * height
Volume of one bed = 2 * 8 * 2
Volume of one bed = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Since each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total volume / 2
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160 bags

The cost of the potting soil is:
Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Cost = 160 * $12
Cost = $1920"
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9

Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of red cards (15) and green cards (24). We are also told that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.
2. Half of the fairies that Katelyn saw came from the east and joined the fairies that were there. 
   Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east.
   Total fairies now: 50 (initial) + 25 (joined) = 75
3. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.
   Total fairies remaining: 75 - 30 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12). 

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35%"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

- 2 boxes of sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds
- 4 bags of carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- 42 bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- 20 sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips:
4400 / 2250 = 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans per week.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. 

Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we need to calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add it to Frederick's total.

60% of 10 plants = 0.6 * 10 = 6
Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + 6 = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. 
Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is 9."
"To find out how much Ali has now, we need to calculate half of Leila's $100, which is $50.

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

Basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 6 * 25 = 150 cards
Baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 5 * 40 = 200 cards

Total cards: 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are given to her students. 
Remaining cards: 350 total cards - 50 cards kept by Miss Maria = 300 cards

Since each student got 10 cards, we can divide the remaining cards by 10 to find the number of students.
Number of students: 300 cards / 10 cards per student = 30 students

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = 9 dollars. She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = 10 dollars. She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 dollars, or 1 dollar. So, she paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total. 9 - 8 = 1.

The number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. To do this, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We are given that (1/4)x = 20. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

(1/4)x * 4 = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing.

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the kids who are allergic to both from the total number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts.

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything:
32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of insects each person found as variables:

Let L = number of insects Lily found
D = number of insects David found
B = number of insects Bodhi found

We know the following information:
1. The total number of insects is 43: L + D + B = 43
2. Lily found 7 more than David: L = D + 7
3. David found half of what Bodhi found: D = B/2

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:
(D + 7) + D + B = 43
Combine like terms:
2D + B + 7 = 43

Now, substitute the third equation into the previous equation:
2(D + B/2) + B + 7 = 43
Distribute the 2:
2D + B + B + 7 = 43
Combine like terms:
2D + 2B + 7 = 43

Now, we have two equations with two variables:
1. 2D + 2B + 7 = 43
2. D = B/2

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
2(B/2) + 2B + 7 = 43
Simplify:
B + 2B + 7 = 43
Combine like terms:
3B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
3B = 36

Divide both sides by 3:
B = 12

Now that we know B, we can find D:
D = B/2
D = 12/2
D = 6

Now that we know D, we can find L:
L = D + 7
L = 6 + 7
L = 13

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is 1/4 * 364 yards = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is 1/2 * 364 yards = 182 yards.

Now, we add the yards used by both: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts for each group of friends.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 2 x 5 = 10.

For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 3 x 2 = 6.

Adding the gifts for both groups, we get 10 + 6 = 16.

Then, Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26.

Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

So, the length of the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of a pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for these packs is 2x.

We know that she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, so the cost of the green apple gum is $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We can set up the equation:

2x + 2 + 1 = 7

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:
2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 4

Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 2

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 lumber, as it provides more sticks per dollar. 

Let's calculate the number of 2 x 8 lumber he can buy with $24:
$24 / $6 = 4

He can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber. Each piece provides 400 sticks, so:
4 * 400 = 1600 sticks

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs each dog has, then multiply that by the cost of each pair of snowshoes.

First, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs each dog has: 
6 dogs * 4 legs = 24 legs

Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs needed:
24 legs / 2 = 12 pairs

Now, we multiply the number of pairs needed by the cost of each pair of snowshoes:
12 pairs * $12.00 = $144.00

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, 5 days a week. 
Total bus trips per week = 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

Cost of each bus trip = $2.20
Total cost of bus trips per week = 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00

Cost of weekly bus pass = $20

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of bus trips per week:
Savings = Total cost of bus trips per week - Cost of weekly bus pass
Savings = $22.00 - $20.00
Savings = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep in each location and then add them together.

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we add the number of cows and sheep in each location: 
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo combined is 120."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4 to find out how many Sophia bought.

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3
Potatoes: 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

3 + 1 = 4"
"To calculate the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to reach his goal, we need to calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds and then divide it by the number of days he has to achieve this goal.

First, we calculate the total calorie deficit required to lose 30 pounds:
30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Since Andy has from December 31st to July 19th, we need to calculate the number of days:
December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days (since his birthday is on the 19th).
Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Now, we calculate the daily calorie deficit:
Daily calorie deficit = Total calorie deficit / Total days
Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 211 days
Daily calorie deficit ≈ 500 calories

So, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 500 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to first calculate how much he earned in a week. 

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns 30 * 7 = $210.

He spent $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract 100 from 210. 

210 - 100 = 110

Gerald has $110 left.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

First, we need to find out how many kilometers she will run. 
She will run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km, so we multiply 8 by 0.25.
8 * 0.25 = 2 km

Now, we multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer (60 ml) by the total number of kilometers she will run (2).
60 * 2 = 120 ml

Hannah will need 120 milliliters of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate 20% of $500:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate 25% of the remaining $400:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

$300"
"To solve this problem, we can let the cost of the lot be x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3x
= 3(30,000)
= 90,000

The house cost $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the total cost of the canvas bags, we need to multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Then, we need to find the total revenue from selling the bags:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Josh made first. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies by dividing Suzanne's cookies by 4.

Suzanne made 36 cookies, so Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we multiply Josh's cookies by 2.

Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40.
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives her sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80.
The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3/5, which is $80 * 3/5 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

$32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the time taken by Rob from hours to minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 2 hours by 60 to get 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time taken by Rob. So, we multiply 120 minutes by 2 to get 240 minutes. Then, we add 40 minutes to get the total time taken by Royce.

240 + 40 = 280 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"To find the total number of loaves sold, we need to add the loaves sold in the morning and the afternoon. 

Loaves sold in the morning: 93
Loaves sold in the afternoon: 39

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins per batch of oatmeal cookies = 3/4 cup

To divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can assume that each portion will be 1/3 of the total raisins.

1/3 of 27 cups = 9 cups

Now, we can divide the total raisins by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies:

27 cups / (3/4 cup) = 27 / 0.75
= 36

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her current and future weekly consumption.

Current weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours per week

Future weekly consumption: 
12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours per week

Current weekly bill: 
84 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $126 per week

Future weekly bill: 
98 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $147 per week

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (2 times 5 days).

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people can paint a whole house in the same amount of time it takes one person to paint a whole house, we can divide the total hours by 5:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

48"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia has. 

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to represent the number of chairs Ophelia has. 

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than Ophelia, Jenna has 20 - 2 = 18 chairs. 

We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 18.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 18 / 3 = 6.

So, Ophelia has 6 chairs.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 6 chairs, while Jenna has 18 chairs. 

The total number of sofas and chairs is 20 + 6 + 18 = 44.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

Let's denote the number of CDs Tom bought as 'x'. The cost of the CD is $4, and the cost of the headphone set is unknown. However, we know that the total amount Tom paid is $48.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

4x + cost of headphone set = 48

Since we don't know the cost of the headphone set, let's call it 'y'. Now the equation becomes:

4x + y = 48

However, we also know that Tom bought only one headphone set, so the cost of the headphone set is $y = 44 (since 48 - 4 = 44).

Now we can rewrite the equation as:

4x + 44 = 48

Subtract 44 from both sides:

4x = 4

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 1

So, Tom bought 1 CD.

Now, to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract 1 from the number of CDs he bought:

1 - 1 = 0

Tom could have bought 0 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

The final answer is: 0"

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers now is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. So, 1/3 * 21 = 7 passengers get on. The total number of passengers now is 59 + 7 = 66.

The final answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be 27, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22.

In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age. So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will be 2 * 22 + 5 = 49.

Since Jame's cousin's age in 8 years is 49, Jame's current age is 49 - 8 = 41.

Now, we know Jame's current age is 22, and his cousin's current age is 41. To find the age difference between them, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age: 41 - 22 = 19.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the total cost of the computer and the printer. 

We know the computer costs $1,100. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since the total cost of all three items is $2,400, the cost of the monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total number of seashells brought by the boys, we multiply the number of boys by the number of seashells each boy brought back.

Number of boys = 20
Number of seashells per boy = 60
Total seashells brought by boys = 20 * 60 = 1200

Since the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, we can represent this as:
Total seashells brought by girls = Total seashells brought by boys + 4 * Total seashells brought by boys
Total seashells brought by girls = 1200 + 4 * 1200
Total seashells brought by girls = 1200 + 4800
Total seashells brought by girls = 6000

Now, to find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we divide the total number of seashells brought by girls by the number of girls.
Number of girls = 20
Total seashells brought by girls = 6000
Seashells per girl = 6000 / 20
Seashells per girl = 300

1. Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

3. The next day, he adds another $10 to his total, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

4. He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

5. He triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total number of days in April is 30. The first half of the month has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days.

The total amount Elvis needs to save is $1125. We can set up an equation to represent this:

15x (first half) + 15(2x) (second half) = 1125

Combine like terms:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine the x terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

So Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2(25) = $50 per day in the second half.

The final answer is: $50"

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to and from work, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance from his home to work, which is 3 miles. 

So, the distance he walks each day is 3 miles * 2 = 6 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles * 5 = 30 miles.

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so 2 x 26 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 letters.
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 26 = 78 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 78.

"To find the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to calculate the number of families notified in each round and add them up.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so the total number of new families notified is 3 * 3 = 9.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so the total number of new families notified is 9 * 3 = 27.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so the total number of new families notified is 27 * 3 = 81.

Now, we add up the number of families notified in each round: 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120.

Therefore, a total of 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the weight he lost to his final weight. 

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3

Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 toys.

402"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator: $12
The cost of 1 geometry set: $10

Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Since the shop gives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost:
10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Five hamburgers at $4 each will be 5 x $4 = $20.
Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack will be 10 x $0.30 = $3.
Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can will be 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the remaining $1500.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the remaining $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together to find Antonella's total earnings:
$300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. 

He has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Since he wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, he will need 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Bill will need 92 additional bottles of water to have enough for his guests."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a hot day and a cold day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3 * 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2 * 16 = 32 minutes
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 * 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time between a hot day and a cold day, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how much John earns per week, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week.

He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
$2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80. To do this, we can divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40):
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes. The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to find the size of Zack's locker first. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size: 12 * 1/4 = 12 * 0.25 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how much coffee Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, she drinks 0.5 cups. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 0.5 = 5 cups.

Now, Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups. To find out how much he needs to reduce, we subtract 4 from 5.

5 - 4 = 1

Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

Number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground.

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees above the ground. The sun is moving upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. 

In 10 hours, the sun will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees upward.

Since the sun started at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle is 90 degrees (perpendicular to the ground). After 10 hours, the angle will be 90 - 32 + 50 = 108 degrees.

So, the final angle of the sun relative to the ground will be 108 degrees.

The final answer is: 108"
"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, we subtract 4 from 12 to find the age of the younger son: 12 - 4 = 8.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs. Since the younger son is 8 years old, we can divide 8 by 5 to find out how many packs he needs: 8 ÷ 5 = 1.6. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, James will need 2 packs of candles (1 full pack and 1 partial pack, but since you can't buy a partial pack, he will need 2 full packs).

Now, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 2 packs * $3 per pack = $6.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate her reading speed in pages per minute. 

Her reading speed is 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, so we can calculate it as follows:
2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.33 pages per minute

Since she read for 15 minutes each night, we can multiply her reading speed by the number of minutes she read:
1.33 pages/minute * 15 minutes = 20 pages

So, Judy read 20 pages in the first week.

To find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we can add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week:
20 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 120 pages

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3.

Now, let's add the number of sandwiches they ate: 4 + 3 = 7.

So, Cody and Trevor ate 7 sandwiches in total. 

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract 7 from the original 12: 
12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Let x be Shiloh's nephew's current age.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 44 + 7 = 51 years.

Since in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, we can set up the equation:

51 = 3x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 51 / 3
x = 17

So, Shiloh's nephew is 17 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write the equation:
R = M + 20
We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write the equation:
R = A + 45

We are also given that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation:
80 = M + 20
Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:
M = 60

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals, we can substitute M = 60 into the second equation:
80 = A + 45
Subtracting 45 from both sides gives us:
A = 35

Now that we know Anna scored 35 goals, we can add up the goals scored by all three teenagers:
Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold (21) by the price of each lemonade ($4). 

21 * 4 = 84

84 - 63 = 21

Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since there are 4 days, he spent a total of:
5 * 4 = $20

He started with $70, so he has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since there are 3 days, he spent a total of:
2 * 3 = $6

He had $50 left, so he spent $6, leaving him with:
$50 - $6 = $44

Since the plastic action figures cost $2 each, the total number of plastic action figures he bought is:
$44 / $2 = 22

Adding the wooden action figures (5) and plastic action figures (22), Peter will have a total of:
5 + 22 = 27

The final answer is 27."

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4.

First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. To find out how many roses he grows in a month, we multiply the number of roses he grows per week by 4.

40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses

Now, we subtract the total roses he grows in a month from the total roses he supplies to the shops.

260 roses (supplied) - 160 roses (grown) = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."

"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to find out how many crayons she has in total. 

She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons. 
3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffins she can make.
192 / 8 = 24 muffins

Now, we can multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin to find out how much money Kate can make.
24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is $36."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the room first. 

The area of the room is calculated by multiplying the length and width: 
Area = length * width
Area = 18 * 12
Area = 216 square feet

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the carpet and padding:
Cost of carpet = $12 per square foot * 216 square feet
Cost of carpet = $2592

Cost of padding = $2 per square foot * 216 square feet
Cost of padding = $432

Total cost of carpet and padding = $2592 + $432
Total cost of carpet and padding = $3024

Next, we need to calculate the cost of removal and installation:
Cost of removal = $4 per square foot * 216 square feet
Cost of removal = $864

Cost of installation = $34 per square foot * 216 square feet
Cost of installation = $7344

Total cost = Cost of carpet and padding + Cost of removal + Cost of installation
Total cost = $3024 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $9632

The total cost to replace the carpet is $9632."

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / 7

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide by the set temperature, and multiply by 100.

Difference = Actual temperature - Set temperature
= 468 - 450
= 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the new set temperature that is 4% higher than the actual temperature.

New set temperature = Actual temperature + (Actual temperature * Percentage off)
= 468 + (468 * 0.04)
= 468 + 18.72

"To find the total time, we need to convert both movie lengths to minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. 
1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. 
2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, so 2 hours and 5 minutes is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of cups Judy bought as 'c' and the number of dishes she bought as 'd'. We know that Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. So, c = 12.

We also know that Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, so d = 2c = 2 * 12 = 24.

Now, we know that Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. So, the number of dishes Judy's friend brought is d + 20 = 24 + 20 = 44.

The total number of cups brought by Judy and her friend is c + 40 = 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes brought by Judy and her friend is d + 44 = 24 + 44 = 68.

Therefore, the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts and then divide it by 90.

First, calculate the cost of 1 box with the 10% discount:
Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 * $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
Total cost = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Now, divide the total cost by 90 to find the cost of each pair of contacts:
Cost per pair = $180.00 / 90 = $2.00

The final answer is $2.00."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * 10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * 10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
   Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since it's 1% fewer).

2. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
   Let's represent the number of green jelly beans as G. Then, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (since it's 1% more).

3. The total number of jelly beans is 4500.
   We can write the equation: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms: 3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
Red jelly beans: 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1501

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
1501 - 1485 = 16

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52

The average of Jared's typing speeds is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight change of the first option from the second.

Weight change for Cheerios: 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds
Weight change for donuts: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, let's find the difference: 
8.75 pounds - 6.25 pounds = 2.5 pounds

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 2.5 pounds."
"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends they invited, the number of friends Alex invited, and the number of spouses.

1. Number of people invited via email: 100
2. Number of friends they invited: 100 * 2 = 200
3. Number of friends Alex invited: 10
4. Number of spouses: 8

Now, we add up all the people: 
100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends of the initially invited) + 10 (Alex's friends) + 8 (spouses) = 318

So, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

318"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of operations.

1. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
2. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
3. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. 

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the daily protein intake and then multiply it by 7.

Daily protein intake = 3 grams (protein per cup) * 200 grams (mushrooms eaten per day) = 600 grams

Weekly protein intake = 600 grams (daily protein intake) * 7 (days per week) = 4200 grams

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.
The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

The second angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The third angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total value of the coins he has.

- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total value of the coins:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total value by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"To calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to break it down by year.

Year 1:
- He gets 5 games for his birthday.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games.
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games.

Year 2:
- He gets 5 games for his birthday.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games.
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) + 24 (additional) = 41 games.

Year 3:
- He gets 5 games for his birthday.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games.
- He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so 48 games.
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) + 24 (additional) + 48 (additional) = 89 games.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve has after 3 years: 
17 (Year 1) + 41 (Year 2) + 89 (Year 3) = 147 games.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance by the time. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the plane has already traveled for 3 hours, we need to add the additional time it would take to travel 2000 miles to the initial time.

Additional time = 5 hours
Initial time = 3 hours
Total time = 5 hours + 3 hours
Total time = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from his original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12

Howard has $12 left."
"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and then add them together.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
60 cups * $0.50 = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
20 cups * $0.60 = $12

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods:
$30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To find the total number of rotations per year, we need to multiply the number of rotations per mile by the number of miles driven per year.

First, we find the number of rotations per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, we multiply the rotations per mile by the number of miles driven per year:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/year = 145,000 rotations/year

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/year = 72.55 years

The tire will need to be replaced in approximately 72.55 years."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings per pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 = $0.20 per washing.

Cost per pump = $0.20 / 60 = $0.00333 per pump.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100. 

Cost per pump in cents = $0.00333 * 100 = 0.33 cents.

The final answer is 0.33."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we need to first calculate the discount on the shirt and the total cost of the outfit before tax.

Discount on the shirt: 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount: $25 - $7.50 = $17.50
Total cost of the outfit before tax: $17.50 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the tax amount. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8%:
Tax amount: 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20
Total cost of the outfit with tax: $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Now, we subtract the total cost of the outfit from Joe's initial budget:
$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe doesn't have enough money to pay for the outfit, he will be short $6.70.

Final answer: -$6.70"
"To find the total amount of butter needed, we need to calculate the amount of butter required for 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

Since 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter, 4 dozen croissants will require 4 times that amount, which is 1/4 * 4 = 1 pound of butter per day.

For 7 days, the total amount of butter needed is 1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to first calculate the cost of repaving his street. 

Cost of repaving Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of steak.

Now, let's add the ounces of meat each player ate:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat. 

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the total number of days in March. March has 31 days.

Since each member posts 3 posts per day, we multiply the number of members by the number of posts per day and then by the number of days in March.

Total posts = 1000 members * 3 posts/member * 31 days
Total posts = 1000 * 3 * 31
Total posts = 93,000

The total number of posts in the group in March is 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year, and finally multiply by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he uses 2 loads per week. Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so he uses 2 * 20 = 40 gallons per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so Gary uses 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons of water per year.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so Gary spends 2080 * 0.15 = $312 per year on water for laundry.

The final answer is: $312"

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row.

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so the number of seats occupied by administrators is:
Seated administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18

The remaining seats are:
Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents is:
Seated parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18

The remaining seats are occupied by students:
Seated students = 54 - 18 = 36

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews at school.
Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews on the way home from school and after dinner.
Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews 1 + 1 = 2 more pieces of gum.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Jim has at the end of the school day.
Jim started with 20 pieces of gum and chewed 4 + 2 = 6 pieces, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim gives to his sister.
Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives 14 / 2 = 7 pieces of gum to his sister.

Step 5: Calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day.
Jim had 14 pieces of gum and gave 7 to his sister, so he has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to first convert his current height from inches to feet. 

Adam's current height is 40 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can divide 40 by 12 to get his height in feet: 
40 / 12 = 3.33 feet

Since the minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet, we need to find the difference between 4 feet and Adam's current height:
4 - 3.33 = 0.67 feet

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert 0.67 feet to inches:
0.67 * 12 = 8 inches

Now, we can divide the difference in inches by Adam's annual growth rate to find out how many years it will take him to reach the required height:
8 / 2 = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate James' profit, we need to first find the cost of the cars to the company and then the profit after the commission.

The cost of the cars to the company is 30% of $25,000, which is:
$25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500

The profit is the selling price minus the cost to the company:
$25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Now, James gets a 10% commission on the profit:
$17,500 * 0.1 = $1,750

So, James made $1,750."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we need to calculate 25% of 100, and then find 60% of that number.

First, calculate 25% of 100:
25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, find 60% of 25:
60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

So, 15 riders can stay upright on the wave.

The number of men who can stay upright on the wave is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
15 - 15 = 0

Therefore, 0 men can stay upright on the wave."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel. 

Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we multiply the price of the diamond jewel by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

Now, we know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). 

To find the total price for all three jewels, we add their prices together.

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"

2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, let's add up the total number of stamps:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

The total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are looking for the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we need a positive relative speed. We can achieve this by taking the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph |
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Answer: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can subtract 6 from 17 to find out how many fish Darren caught.

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can add 3 to 11.

11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum cost they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class to find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for.

$60 / $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has 10 classes, he can miss up to 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and then add it to Jewel's daily production.

Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 times Jewel's daily production. 

Jewel's daily production is 50 customers. 
Julie's daily production = 2 * 50 = 100 customers

Total daily production = Jewel's daily production + Julie's daily production
Total daily production = 50 + 100 = 150 customers

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is:
Total weekly production = Total daily production * 7
Total weekly production = 150 * 7
Total weekly production = 1050 customers

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many miles Reggie ran. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance. 

Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 17 miles

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples, we need to multiply the cost of one apple by 5. 

Cost of one apple = $5.20 / 4 = $1.30
Cost of 5 apples = $1.30 * 5 = $6.50

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we need to multiply the cost of one orange by 5.

Cost of one orange = $3.30 / 3 = $1.10
Cost of 5 oranges = $1.10 * 5 = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost.

Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
3. The cost of leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
4. The cost of running boards is $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
5. The cost of the upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to calculate the raise first. 

5% of $20000 is 0.05 * 20000 = $1000. 

So, his new monthly salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

Since the bonus is half a month's salary, it is $21000 / 2 = $10500.

Now, we add the monthly salary and the bonus to get the total monthly income: $21000 + $10500 = $31500.

To find the yearly income, we multiply the monthly income by 12: $31500 * 12 = $378000.

The final answer is: $378000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. Cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7500
2. Cost of dress pants: 10 dress pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1500
3. Cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7500 + $1500 + $600 = $9000

The total cost of everything is $9000."
"To find the total number of articles published, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website in February and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so their son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total miles biked by Alisa, we multiply her speed (12 miles per hour) by the time she biked (4.5 hours):

12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles

To find the total miles biked by Stanley, we multiply his speed (10 miles per hour) by the time he biked (2.5 hours):

10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the miles biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total:

54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil: 
Distance of soil = 24 feet
Rate of digging through soil = 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = Distance / Rate = 24 / 4 = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay:
Distance of clay = 8 feet
Rate of digging through clay = 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour (since he digs twice as fast through clay)
Time to dig through clay = Distance / Rate = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"

"To calculate the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the cost of the pomegranates on each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 = $400
$2 off = $400 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost:
20 * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$398 - $540 = -$142

Since the final price paid by Clara is less than the final price paid by Sheila, the difference is negative."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to find the sales of green hats first. 

Since the sales from red hats were $400 and they were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

Red hats = 1/2 * Green hats
400 = 1/2 * Green hats
Green hats = 400 * 2
Green hats = 800

Now, we know that the total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales of red and green hats:
Total sales in the first month = Red hats + Green hats
Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

Now, we can find the total amount she made in two months:
Total amount in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
Total amount in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount in two months = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down:

1. James gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 8 hours.
2. The first paid hour is $15.
3. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost for the remaining 7 hours is 2 * $15 = $30 per hour.
4. The total cost for the remaining 7 hours is 7 * $30 = $210.
5. Adding the first paid hour, the total cost is $15 + $210 = $225.

The final answer is: $225"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Subtract the current bank balance from the expected wage:
$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's bank account has been overdrawn by $120. This means that $120 was withheld from her wage."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg for 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total deviled egg halves: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12.

Total eggs: 24
Number of eggs per dozen: 12

Total dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages.

Total pages = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 of 15
Pages already written = (1/3) * 15
Pages already written = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written
Pages left to write = 15 - 5
Pages left to write = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days left = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the total cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. 
The monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the first year is $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The final answer is: $180,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cooking time for pork and then for beans.

Let's denote the cooking time for rice as R, pork as P, and beans as B. We know that R = 30 minutes.

We are given that it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so we can write an equation:
P = R + 20
P = 30 + 20
P = 50 minutes

We are also given that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so we can write an equation:
B = (P + R) / 2
B = (50 + 30) / 2
B = 40 minutes

Now, we need to find the total cooking time, which is the sum of the cooking times for all three foods:
Total time = R + P + B
Total time = 30 + 50 + 40
Total time = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the weighted average of the two ingredients.

Cost of almonds in the first mixture: 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of walnuts in the first mixture: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the weighted average of the two ingredients.

Cost of almonds in the second mixture: 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of walnuts in the second mixture: 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost: $10 - $7 = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. We also know that each animal has one head.

We can write two equations based on the given information:

1) The total number of animal legs: 4s + 2g = 70
2) The total number of animal heads: s + g = 20

We can solve these equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From equation (2), we can express 'g' in terms of 's': g = 20 - s

Now, substitute 'g' into equation (1): 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expand and simplify: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70
Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70
Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30
Divide both sides by 2: s = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the cost of the more expensive coffee, we need to calculate 20% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1
The cost of the more expensive coffee is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.
The cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42

He also buys a donut for $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44."
"To find the total cost of the items Gus bought, we need to add the cost of the chips, the bucket of fried chicken, and the bottle of soda.

2 bags of chips for $2.00 each is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the chips to the cost of the fried chicken and the soda: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Since Gus spent $20.00 in total, we need to subtract the total cost of the items he bought from the total amount he spent to find the cost of the apple pie.

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find the number of newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

"To find the total number of hours John spends in the class, we need to multiply the number of times the class meets per week by the number of hours per class, and then multiply that by the number of weeks.

Total hours per week = 4 * 2 = 8 hours
Total hours for 6 weeks = 8 * 6 = 48 hours

Since John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, we divide the total hours by 1.5 to find the number of recipes he learns.

Number of recipes = 48 / 1.5 = 32

The final answer is 32."
"To find the number of math teachers, we need to calculate 100% - 60% of the total number of teachers.

100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we multiply 40% by the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers.

40% of 150 = 0.4 * 150 = 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by 6 to find the total time they spend sleeping.

60 * 6 = 360

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

We know that Aurelia has $120.

Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

We also know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

To find out how much each person would have if they share the total money equally, we divide the total money by 3:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3
Money per person = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the total time of the 4 quarters and add the extra 5 minutes.

"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate the percentage of employees who are both management and oversee the company.

First, we find the percentage of employees who are management: 20% of 50 employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees.

Then, we find the percentage of these 10 employees who oversee the entire company: 30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees.

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 16.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Now, let's add the total amount of dry ingredients: 
80 tablespoons (flour) + 48 tablespoons (sugar) + 4 tablespoons (salt) = 132 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana needs to make 16 muffins is 132 tablespoons."
"To find the total amount of candy, we need to add the amount of candy each person had initially.

Robert had 3 pounds of candy.
Cindy had 5 pounds of candy.
Aaron had 4 pounds of candy.

Total amount of candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they want to share the candy equally among the three of them, we need to divide the total amount by 3.

12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15, so the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4."
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first find the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral.

We know that Christina had 12 good days initially, 8 good days in the next 3 days, and 8 good days in the first 8 days. So, the total number of good days is 12 + 8 + 8 = 28.

However, we also know that the total number of days in the month is 30. Since 28 days were accounted for, the remaining days must be neutral. 

So, the number of neutral days is 30 - 28 = 2.

We are given that the first eight days were good, the second eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral. This means that the remaining 2 days must be bad.

Now, we know that the total number of bad days is 8 + 2 = 10.

The number of good days left in the month is 12 - 8 = 4.

Final answer: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to isolate x. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the initial height from feet to inches and then find the difference between the target height and the initial height. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches:
20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we can find the difference between the target height (600 inches) and the initial height (240 inches):
600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the difference by the growth rate to find the number of days:
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the initial number of dogs and toys.
James initially had 4 dogs and 4 toys.

Step 2: Calculate the number of dogs after the first visit.
There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so the total number of dogs is 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs.

Step 3: Calculate the number of toys needed for the 12 dogs.
Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys.

Step 4: Calculate the number of dogs after the second visit.
There are twice as many dogs as when James left, so the total number of dogs is 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.

Step 5: Calculate the number of toys needed for the 24 dogs.
Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 24 toys.

Step 6: Calculate the number of dogs after the third visit.
3 dogs were gone, so the total number of dogs is 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Step 7: Calculate the total number of toys needed.
Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the amount of money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, find the amount Dylan invested: 
   Dylan's investment = 2/5 of $1200
   Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200
   Dylan's investment = (2 * 1200) / 5
   Dylan's investment = 2400 / 5
   Dylan's investment = 480

2. Now, find the remaining amount after Dylan's investment:
   Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
   Remaining amount = 1200 - 480
   Remaining amount = 720

3. Next, find the amount Frances invested:
   Frances' investment = 2/3 of the remaining amount
   Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720
   Frances' investment = (2 * 720) / 3
   Frances' investment = 1440 / 3
   Frances' investment = 480

4. Finally, find the amount Skyler invested:
   Skyler's investment = Remaining amount - Frances' investment

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they have already collected. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to subtract the signatures they already have from their goal. 
100 - 64 = 36 signatures

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns, we need to first find out how much Lorie earns in two days. 

Lorie earns $10 per hour and works for 2 days, so she earns 10 * 2 = $20 in 2 days.

Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, Karen earns 2 * 20 = $40 in 2 days.

Karen works 3 hours per day, so in 2 days, she works 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

To find out how much Karen earns in 6 hours, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: 40 * 6 = $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the number of hash browns, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 

So, the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36, which can be simplified to 1:6.

Now, we can use this ratio to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes. 

Since 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, 96 potatoes will make 36 * (96/6) = 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: 576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by 9.

Total weight = 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg

Now, we subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight.

Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The elevator will have exceeded the maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies each person has and then add them together.

Let's start by using the information that Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max. 

So, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

We also know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. 

So, the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Now, we know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. 

So, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 96 (Summer) = 237 cookies.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length as 'x'. 

Since the dress is extended by 50% of its original length, the new length will be x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

We also know that the final length of the dress is 140cm, and 20cm is added to the bottom. So, the length without the lace trim is 140 - 20 = 120cm.

Since the length without the lace trim is 1.5x, we can set up the equation: 1.5x = 120.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 1.5: x = 120 / 1.5 = 80.

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to find the average of the two times.

Average time = (60 + 40) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50 minutes

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent from the total time available.

Total time available = 30 minutes
Time spent so far = 6 minutes (to the corner) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes

Time left = Total time available - Time spent so far
Time left = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left = 11 minutes

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The total amount Catherine pays is $14."
"To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we need to multiply the number of cookies Greta bakes by 2. 
Celinda bakes 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.

Now, let's add the number of cookies Greta and Celinda baked together. 
30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies while cooling, so we need to subtract 10 from the total number of cookies. 
90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is 80."
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin is x + 7.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, the total number of people is 5. 

So, the equation is: x + (x + 7) + (x + 7) + (x + 7) + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms: 5x + 28 = 44

Subtract 28 from both sides: 5x = 16

Divide both sides by 5: x = 3.2

Since x represents the age of the younger twin, the age of the younger twin is 3.2 years.

The final answer is: 3.2"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first convert the time he has before dinner into minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins each person has saved after 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, he will save:
20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month. 2/5 of 20 coins is 8 coins. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. 
In 10 years, Neil will save:
28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings:
2400 coins (Rong) + 3360 coins (Neil) = 5760 coins"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2: 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as x. We can set up the equation: 
60% of x = 0.6x
Since the total bill includes the cost of vaccines ($40) and the heartworm check, we can set up the equation:
0.6x = $40 + x

Now, let's solve for x:
0.6x - x = $40
-0.4x = $40
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

So, the total bill is $100. Now, we can find out how much John leaves with:
$125 - $100 = $25"
"To calculate the price of the crate, we need to first find the price of each fruit and then multiply it by the quantity of each fruit in the crate.

The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, and the price of one orange is three times the price of one banana. 

Since one apple costs $0.5, 
- one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1
- one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3

Now, we can calculate the total price of the crate by multiplying the price of each fruit by the quantity of each fruit and adding them together:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate the percentage of deer that are 8-point bucks.

First, we know that 50% of the deer are bucks. So, the number of bucks is 50% of 50 deer.
50% of 50 = 0.5 * 50 = 25 bucks

Next, we know that 20% of the bucks are 8 points. So, the number of 8-point bucks is 20% of the number of bucks.
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field."

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
40% of 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard:
3 boxes of 5 fireworks each = 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and her backyard:

Total number of people = 20

Since each seat can hold 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks, we need to find the total number of drinks and snacks needed. 

Total number of drinks = Total number of people * 2
Total number of drinks = 20 * 2
Total number of drinks = 40

Total number of snacks = Total number of people * 3
Total number of snacks = 20 * 3
Total number of snacks = 60

Since each drink and snack costs $2, we can find the total cost of drinks and snacks by multiplying the total number of drinks and snacks by $2.

Total cost of drinks = Total number of drinks * $2
Total cost of drinks = 40 * $2
Total cost of drinks = $80

Total cost of snacks = Total number of snacks * $2

"To solve this problem, we can start by finding out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Let's denote the weight of gravel that Gissela's truck can carry as 'x'. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, Gordy's truck can carry 'x + 800' pounds.

When Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the total weight of gravel they can carry is 11,600 pounds. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 800) + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Combine like terms:

2x + 800 + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600

Subtract 800 from both sides:

2x + Gary's truck capacity = 10,800

Now, we need to find Gary's truck capacity. Since we don't know Gary's truck capacity, let's denote it as 'y'. So, the equation becomes:

2x + y = 10,800

We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. So, we can substitute 'x' with 4,000:

2(4,000) + y = 10,800

8,000 + y = 10,800

Subtract 8,000 from both sides:

y = 2,800

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: 2,800"

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. 
To find 80% of 40%, we multiply 40% by 0.8 (since 80% = 80/100 = 0.8). 
0.8 * 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city:
40% - 32% = 8%

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

= 50 quarts per hour

Now, let's find the rate of production for vanilla ice cream:
Rate of vanilla ice cream = Total quarts / Total hours
= 50 quarts / 4 hours
= 12.5 quarts per hour

Now that we have the rates, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:
Total production in 48 hours = (Rate of chocolate ice cream * 48) + (Rate of vanilla ice cream * 48)
= (50 * 48) + (12.5 * 48)

- Right foot: 300 taps/minute
- Left foot: 250 taps/minute
- Combined taps/minute: 300 + 250 = 550 taps/minute

Scenario 2: Arms raised
- Right foot: 200 taps/minute
- Left foot: 200 taps/minute
- Combined taps/minute: 200 + 200 = 400 taps/minute

Since Helga dances for 5 minutes in total, with her arms raised for 2 minutes, we can break it down as follows:
- 2 minutes with arms raised: 2 * 400 = 800 taps
- 3 minutes with arms down: 3 * 550 = 1650 taps

Total taps = 800 + 1650 = 2450 taps

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing it and then subtract the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

First, let's calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:
$450 (damage to the car) + $120 (fine) = $570

Now, let's add the cost of the asphalt:
$570 + $75 (3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each) = $645

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the damage to the car to find out how much money Ron saves:
$450 (damage to the car) - $645 (total cost) = -$195

Since the result is negative, it means that Ron will actually lose $195 by fixing the pothole himself.

Final answer: -$195"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
170 (normal chairs) - 20 (normal chairs sent for repair) = 150

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
23 (baby chairs) - 13 (baby chairs sent for repair) = 10

Now, let's add the number of normal chairs and baby chairs left:
150 (normal chairs) + 10 (baby chairs) = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people, they ate 3 x 2/3 = 2 pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so they ate 2 x 12 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. Since 1 ½ pizzas is equivalent to 1 whole pizza and 6 slices, they ate 1 x 12 + 6 = 18 slices.

Now, let's subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time the cat takes. 

The cat takes 30 minutes, so 2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

The dog takes 20 minutes to eat the sausages.

Now, we need to find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages. 

The average time is the sum of the time the cat and dog take divided by 2. 

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: 
9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 9:
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed by students and teachers separately.

Number of windows smashed by students: 
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed by students = 64 * 4 = 256

Number of windows smashed by teachers: 
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed by teachers = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students) + 64 (teachers) = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools out of the total number of spools.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100
= (60 / 150) * 100
= 0.4 * 100
= 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who voted by midday (2/5 of 5000):
   2/5 * 5000 = (2 * 5000) / 5 = 10000 / 5 = 2000

2. Calculate the number of people remaining after midday:
   5000 - 2000 = 3000

3. Calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 (2/3 of the remaining people):
   2/3 * 3000 = (2 * 3000) / 3 = 6000 / 3 = 2000

4. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:
   3000 - 2000 = 1000

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4 pieces).

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To find the total number of smores needed, we need to calculate the number of smores for kids and adults separately.

Number of smores for kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
Number of smores for adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total number of smores needed: 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

We know that Dora is 15 years old. 

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. 
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years.

The final answer is: 87"

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together.

1. Cindy's math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so together they weigh 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.
2. Her French book weighs 4 pounds.
3. Her English book weighs 3 pounds.
4. Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. So, the number of votes candidate C got is 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples. 

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount.
90 - 87 = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

So, Steven has 10 books.

Now, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, Alice has:

10 + 6 = 16 books

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's number of books from Clara's number of books:

20 - 16 = 4

Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Cost of 10-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a gallon jar
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent:
Total amount spent = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount spent = $50 + $48
Total amount spent = $98"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students who like to play video games. 

First, we know that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. The total number of students is 50. 

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as 'x'. We also know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. So, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of students is 50, we can set up the equation:

10 (bakers) + 5 (basketball players) + x (video game players) + 10 (music players) = 50

Combine the constants:
25 + x = 50

Subtract 25 from both sides:
x = 25

So, 25 students like to play video games.

"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12.

1/3 of 12 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds were scared away.

Initially, Jeremy had 12 birds. After scaring away 4, he had 12 - 4 = 8 birds.

Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard. Now, the total number of birds is 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and two classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 / 2 = 40

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, we multiply 40 by 0.4.

40 * 0.4 = 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, Mara had 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. She added 3 slices of cake to the plate, so now she has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
3. She tripled the number of slices she currently has, so now she has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
4. She ate 2 slices, so now she has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
5. Her friend stole 5 slices, so now she has 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to add up the total number of animals and divide it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Total number of animals = 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses

Now, let's divide the total number of animals by 7:
28 ÷ 7 = 4

Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"To calculate the total cost, Mark buys 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

He gets 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, subtract the total cost from the total value: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total cost of the first amusement park, we need to multiply the number of adults by the adult fee and the number of children by the child fee, then add the two amounts together.

For the first amusement park: 
Adults: 2 * $26 = $52
Children: 2 * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
Adults: 2 * $14 = $28
Children: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

To find the savings, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of marbles Carl and Cal have.

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 
Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles.

Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can find the number of marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4. 
Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. 
Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112

"To find the number of students in each group, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups (6). 

However, the question states that 12 groups are required, not 6. 

To find the number of students in each group, we divide 54 by 12: 
54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to re-evaluate the situation. 

If 12 groups are required, we can calculate the total number of students needed for 12 groups:
12 * 4 = 48

Since 54 is more than 48, we need to find out how many more students are needed to fill the 12 groups. 
54 - 48 = 6

However, the question asks for the number of groups needed, not the number of students. Since we already have 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to reach 12 groups. 
12 - 6 = 6

The answer is 6."
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is: 
60 chairs/day * 20 days = 1200 chairs

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is: 
100 chairs/day * 8 days = 800 chairs

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is: 
1200 chairs + 800 chairs = 2000 chairs

"To find the initial number of glasses and plates, we need to convert the dozens to individual units.

8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's calculate the number of glasses and plates that were returned broken:
10 glasses were broken, so the number of glasses remaining is 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
6 plates were broken, so the number of plates remaining is 48 - 6 = 42 plates

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
She starts with 30 small stickers. 
90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Step 2: Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
She starts with 40 large stickers. 
50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

Step 3: Lorraine trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons.
She has 20 large stickers left. 
Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
She has 3 small stickers left from the initial trade.
She gets 60 small stickers from the second trade.
She has 20 large stickers.

Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, we can convert the large stickers to small stickers:
20 large stickers * 3 small stickers per large sticker = 60 small stickers.

Now, we add up all the small stickers:
3 (initial small stickers) + 60 (from the second trade) + 60 (from the large stickers) = 123 small stickers.

The total number of buttons Lorraine has is 123 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 143 buttons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the information that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. 

Since the total number of council members is 33, and the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we multiply x by 2:

Votes in favor = 2x
Votes in favor = 2 * 11
Votes in favor = 22

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of students:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. 
60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Pomeranians first. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find out how much Jayden has, we need to calculate the amount of money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already had to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

Since the camera costs $200, we subtract the amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."

"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas and add it to 200.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

"To find the total number of books read, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find the number of books Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books initially and then decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we can find the number of books Ahmed read by dividing 300 by 2: 300 / 2 = 150.

Now, we can find the total number of books read by adding the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed: 450 + 150 = 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break it down into two parts: her hourly wage and the daily bonus.

For Monday:
- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, so her total hours worked is 4 * 5 = 20 hours.
- Her hourly wage is $15, so her earnings for 20 hours is 20 * $15 = $300.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets a daily bonus of $5, so her total earnings for Monday is $300 + $5 = $305.

For Wednesday:
- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, so her total hours worked is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- Her hourly wage is $15, so her earnings for 4 hours is 4 * $15 = $60.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets a daily bonus of $5, so her total earnings for Wednesday is $60 + $5 = $65.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $305 + $65 = $370.

The final answer is: $370"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he earns from selling eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he earns from eggplants is:
20 * 3 = 60

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We also know that he earns $60 from eggplants. To find out how much he needs to earn from corn, we subtract the amount he earns from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make:
135 - 60 = 75

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we can divide the amount he needs to earn from corn by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear:
75 / 25 = 3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

The final answer is 50."

   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, the total time spent driving is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Total time spent at the museum and driving = 6 hours

Total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the number of movies in series: 
   A third of 600 movies is 600 / 3 = 200 movies.

2. Calculate the cost of the series: 
   Since the series cost is 1/3 of the cost of a normal movie, it's 1/3 * $10 = $3.33 per series. 
   The cost of 200 series is 200 * $3.33 = $666.

3. Calculate the number of remaining movies: 
   Total movies - movies in series = 600 - 200 = 400 movies.

4. Calculate the number of older movies: 
   40% of 400 movies is 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies.

5. Calculate the cost of the older movies: 
   The cost of 160 older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

6. Calculate the cost of the remaining movies: 
   The cost of the remaining 240 movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

7. Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies:

The total amount Winston spent on fruit is $38.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the family when they hiked. 

Let's denote the speed of the family when they drove as 'd' miles per hour. Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, their hiking speed is d/2 - 5 miles per hour.

We know that the time they spent driving is 6 hours, and their driving speed is 50 miles per hour. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

So, the distance they drove is 6 * 50 = 300 miles.

Now, we know that the time they spent hiking is 1.5 hours, and their hiking speed is d/2 - 5 miles per hour. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

So, the distance they hiked is 1.5 * (d/2 - 5).

Since the total distance is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, we can set up the equation: 300 + 1.5 * (d/2 - 5) = total distance.

However, we don't know the total distance. We can express the total distance as 300 + 1.5 * (d/2 - 5) = 300 + 0.75d - 7.5.

Now we have the equation: 300 + 0.75d - 7.5 = total distance.

Since the total distance is the distance they drove plus the distance they hiked, we can set up the equation: 300 + 0.75d - 7.5 = 300 + 1.5 * (d/2 - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.75d - 7.5 = 0.75d - 7.5.

This equation is an identity, which means that the equation is true for any value of 'd'. However, we can use the fact that the time they spent hiking is 1.5 hours to find the value of 'd'. 

We know that the time they spent hiking is 1.5 hours, and their hiking speed is d/2 - 5 miles per hour. We can set up the equation: 1.5 = (d/2 - 5) / 1.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 1.5 = d/2 - 5.

Now, we can solve for 'd': 1.5 + 5 = d/2.

7 = d/2.

d = 14.

Now that we know the value of 'd', we can find the distance they hiked: 1.5 * (d/2 - 5) = 1.5 * (14/2 - 5) = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

The distance to their vacation spot is 300 + 6 = 306 miles.

The final answer is: 306"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations for both Ava and Emma's scores.

Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A.

Ava's score: 
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on (E + 8) enemies.
- She collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects (E + 3) berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level (E - 4) seconds.

The points for each enemy jumped on is 10, for each berry collected is 5, and for each second left on the timer is 30.

Ava's score = 10 * (E + 8) + 5 * (E + 3) + 30 * (E - 4)

Emma's score: 
- She jumps on E enemies.
- She collects E berries.
- She finishes the level E seconds.

Emma's score = 10 * E + 5 * E + 30 * E

Now, let's simplify Ava's score equation:
Ava's score = 10E + 80 + 5E + 15 + 30E - 120
Ava's score = 45E - 25

Now, let's simplify Emma's score equation:
Emma's score = 10E + 5E + 30E
Emma's score = 45E

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
Difference = (45E - 25) - 45E
Difference = -25

The final answer is -25."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract 30 dollars from 64 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the result by 2:
34 ÷ 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. So, for these two days, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of white and orange fish Bob bought.

Let W be the number of white fish Bob bought, and let O be the number of orange fish he bought.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. 

We can set up the following equation based on this information:

3 + O = 2(4 + W)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + O = 8 + 2W

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

O = 5 + 2W

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17. We can set up another equation based on this information:

O + W = 17

Substituting O = 5 + 2W into this equation:

(5 + 2W) + W = 17

Combine like terms:

3W + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3W = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

W = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total weekly fuel consumption, we need to calculate the daily fuel consumption and then multiply it by 5 (since he uses his car 5 days a week.

Daily fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Daily fuel consumption = 5 miles / 10 MPG
Daily fuel consumption = 0.5 gallons

Weekly fuel consumption = Daily fuel consumption * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 0.5 gallons * 5
Weekly fuel consumption = 2.5 gallons

To calculate the weekly fuel cost, we need to multiply the weekly fuel consumption by the current price of gas:
Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $7.50

$300 (total cost) / 2 = $150 (school's contribution)

Now, we need to subtract the amount John has from the total cost minus the school's contribution to find out how much he is missing:

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) = $150
$150 (remaining cost) - $50 (John's money) = $100

John is missing $100."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

Total passed: 340 + 40 + 400 = 780

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
780 passed / 1000 total = 0.78 or 78%

The school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"To find the total number of glass chips Milo has, we need to multiply the number of chips in one bag by the number of bags he has. 

72 chips per bag * 2 bags = 144 chips

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total number of square inches.

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can multiply the number of square inches by the height to find the total area.

12 square inches * 3 inches = 36 square inches

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each student drank and then add it up.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts): 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first find out how many candies he has in total.

Dale started with 100 candies and sold 150, so he has 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible since he can't have a negative number of candies. This means he actually sold more candies than he had.

Then, he ordered 100 more candies, so now he has 100 (the ones he had left) + 100 (the new ones) = 200 candies.

Since he originally wanted to sell 100 candies, and he already sold 150, we need to find out how many more he needs to sell to reach his goal. To do this, we subtract the number of candies he has from his goal: 100 (goal) - 200 (current candies) = -100. However, this is also not possible since he can't sell a negative number of candies.

This means that Dale actually sold more candies than he had, and he now has more candies than he needs. To find out how many candies he has left, we subtract the number of candies he sold from the total number of candies he has: 200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies.

Since Dale has more candies than he needs, he doesn't need to sell any more to reach his goal."
"To calculate the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the beginning of the year (January), there are 10 students.
- At the end of January, the number of students doubles to 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles to 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles to 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles to 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles to 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract this number from the total number of students at the end of May: 
320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose picked and subtract the number of petals she dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals she picked:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals picked: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Now, let's calculate the number of petals she dropped:
- She dropped 1 of each type of flower, so she dropped 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 petals

Now, let's subtract the number of petals she dropped from the total number of petals she picked:
101 - 18 = 83 petals

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used:
John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.
Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag:
35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (marshmallows used) = 17 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since there are two kids:
17 (remaining marshmallows) ÷ 2 = 8.5 S'mores per kid.

Since you can't make a fraction of a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores per kid.

John and DeSean can have 8 S'mores each.

Final answer: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

First, let's convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time each person played:

- Jack played for 20 minutes.
- One of his friends played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The other friend played for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes.
- The better friend played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, we need to convert the total time to quarters: 70 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 3.5 games.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total cost is 3.5 * 0.25 = 0.875 quarters.

To convert the total cost to dollars, we multiply by 0.25: 0.875 * 0.25 = 0.21875 dollars.

The final answer is: 0.21875"
"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the amount of salt is S, the amount of oil is O, the amount of fragrance is F, the amount of citrus zest is Z, and the amount of sugar is G.

We are given the following information:

1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
2. Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
3. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
4. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

We can substitute the expressions from the first three equations into the fourth equation:

S + O + F + Z + G = 10
S + 2S + F + Z + S = 10 (substituting O = 2S and Z = F)
4S + F + F = 10 (since Z = F)
4S + 2F = 10

Now, we can substitute S = G (from the second equation) into the equation:

4S + 2F = 10
4S + 2S = 10 (substituting S = G)
6S = 10
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we have the value of S, we can find the value of O:

O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

So, Tanya uses 10/3 ounces of oil.

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To find the total amount John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats at $500 each is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows at $1500 each is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

John spent $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, let's subtract the cupcakes he already has from the total:
63 - 48 = 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2 (since 20% = 20/100 = 0.2).
   40 * 0.2 = 8

   So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left.
   Joe had 40 cars initially.
   He sold 8 cars.
   He gave away 16 cars.

   So, the total number of cars Joe has left is 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations ($50,000) from the total amount raised ($175,000).

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the remaining amount by 20 to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

Time walked on the first day: 8 hours
Time walked on the second day: Half of 8 hours = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days: 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars is now 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a day, we need to multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks per cycle and the amount he earns per task.

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
Amount per task: $1.20

First, multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks per cycle:
30 cycles * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks per day

Now, multiply the number of tasks per day by the amount per task:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

Since John works 7 days a week, multiply the daily earnings by 7:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 
88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is 52."
"Let's denote the number of cards that PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each color of eggs Cindy has and then add them up.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy has 5 green eggs.

Since she has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she has 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Since she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy has 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and add it to the cost of shipping per mile.

Weight of the book: 4 pounds
Cost per pound: $0.35
Cost per mile: $0.08
Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles

Cost of shipping: 
Weight cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
Mileage cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
Original price of the book: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24

Since Milly will only get 75% of the original price back, she will lose:
Original price: $32
Refund amount: $24
Amount lost: $32 - $24 = $8

The total amount Milly will lose is $8."
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the money Mulan had initially to the money her father gave her: 
$40 + $100 = $140

Next, we calculate the total cost of the items she bought:
2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60
Adding the cost of the bag: $60 + $20 = $80

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total amount of money Mulan had: 
$140 - $80 = $60

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

Week 1: 8,000 bars
Week 2: Half of Week 1 = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Week 3: Three times as much as Week 1 = 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Since the problem doesn't mention any production in the fourth week, we can assume that Boris maintains the same production level as the third week.

The final answer is: 24,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

1. Time spent on TikTok videos: 
   18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes per week
   Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 
   72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes

2. Time spent writing songs: 
   2 hours/week * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes/week
   120 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 480 minutes

3. Time spent doing makeup: 
   15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
   90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a month: 
288 minutes (videos) + 480 minutes (writing songs) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the base cost of the installation and then add the cost of the additional items.

The base cost of the installation is $129.00.

The additional items Angela needs are:
- 6 mirrors (4 + 2) = 6
- 2 chandeliers (1 + 1)
- 20 pictures (10 + 10)

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is:
- 6 mirrors: 6 x $15.00 = $90.00
- 2 chandeliers: 2 x $15.00 = $30.00
- 20 pictures: 20 x $15.00 = $300.00

The total cost of the additional items is $90.00 + $30.00 + $300.00 = $420.00.

The total cost of the installation and the additional items is $129.00 + $420.00 = $549.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The final answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroos. Since 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of each turtle is:
Speed of each turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of each turtle = 3 hours

Now, we need to find the time it takes for 4 turtles to cover the same distance. Since the distance remains the same, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed

We know the speed of each turtle, so we can find the time it takes for 4 turtles to cover the distance:
Time = Distance / (4 * Speed of each turtle)
Time = Distance / (4 * 3 hours)
Time = Distance / 12 hours

Since we don't know the exact distance, we can represent the time it takes for 4 turtles as:
Time = x / 12 hours

We know that 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, so we can set up an equation:
3 * 6 hours = 18 hours
3 * 6 hours = 18 hours
18 hours = 18 hours

Now, we can set up an equation using the time it takes for 4 turtles:
3 * 6 hours = 4 * x / 12 hours
18 hours = x / 3 hours
x = 18 hours * 3 hours
x = 54 hours

However, this is the time it takes for 3 kangaroos to cover the distance. We need to find the time it takes for 4 turtles to cover the same distance. Since the distance remains the same, we can set up a proportion:
3 * 6 hours = 4 * x / 12 hours
18 hours = x / 3 hours
x = 18 hours * 3 hours
x = 54 hours

Since the distance is the same, we can set up a proportion:
3 * 6 hours = 4 * x / 12 hours
3 * 6 hours = 4 * x / 12 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many clay dishes each person made and then add them together.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

We also know that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional money from her mom.

First, let's calculate the price of the laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Now, let's add the money she received from her part-time job and her mom: 
$400 + $150 + $80 = $630

Since she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation: 
$630 = $600 + $50

This means she has $630, which is the total amount she needs to buy the laptop. 

The final answer is: $630"
"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Total number of slices = 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 - 15 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many liters of milk the current 3 cows produce.

3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters

Since the farmer wants 25 liters, we need to find out how many more liters he needs.

25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk per day.

10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of the glue sticks that are used and subtract it from the total length of the glue sticks.

First, we need to find the length of the glue sticks that are used. 

For the first glue stick, 1/6 is used, so the length used is 1/6 * 12 = 2 mm.
For the second glue stick, 2/3 is used, so the length used is 2/3 * 12 = 8 mm.
For the third glue stick, 1/2 is used, so the length used is 1/2 * 12 = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks is 12 mm. To find the length of the glue sticks that are not used, we subtract the length used from the total length: 12 - 16 = -4 mm. However, since we can't have a negative length, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We need to find the length of the glue sticks that are not used. We can do this by finding the length of the glue sticks that are left and adding them together.

For the first glue stick, 5/6 is left, so the length left is 5/6 * 12 = 10 mm.
For the second glue stick, 1/3 is left, so the length left is 1/3 * 12 = 4 mm.
For the third glue stick, 1/2 is left, so the length left is 1/2 * 12 = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are left: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 mm.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of socks and then the number of dishes.

Let's denote the number of socks as S and the number of dishes as D.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes, so D = 60.

We also know that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so D = 2S. Since D = 60, we can set up the equation 60 = 2S and solve for S.

60 = 2S
S = 60 / 2
S = 30

Now that we know the number of socks, we can find the number of dishes Peter has. We know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has D = 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now that we know the number of socks and dishes for both Jack and Peter, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together.

Total number of socks = S + S (since Peter has the same number of socks as Jack) = 30 + 30 = 60
Total number of dishes = D + D (since Peter has the same number of dishes as Jack) = 60 + 60 = 120

Total number of socks and dishes = 60 + 120 = 180

Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English

"To find the total time required for each group, we need to add the time for getting on stage, performing, and exiting the stage. 

Time for each group = 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting the stage) = 10 minutes

Now, we need to subtract the time for the intermission from the total concert time to find the available time for the groups. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time for intermission = 10 minutes
Available time for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we can divide the available time by the time required for each group to find the number of groups that can perform.

Number of groups = Available time for groups / Time for each group
= 110 minutes / 10 minutes
= 11

The final answer is 11."

The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

For the first year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 1 year is $300 + $225 = $525.

For the second year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 2 years is $525 + $225 = $750.

For the third year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 3 years is $750 + $225 = $975.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."

"To find the total time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to calculate the time it takes to clean half of 90 rooms.

First, we need to find half of 90:
90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:
45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

2. In the next year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.
3. In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 48 * 2 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have 144 homes built over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S.

2. I am three years younger than my brother, so A = B - 3.

3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so A = S + 2.

4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so M = 3B - 1.

5. The sum of our ages is 87, so A + B + S + M = 87.

Now, we can substitute the expressions for A, B, and M from the first three equations into the fifth equation:

(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5B - 8 = 87

Add 8 to both sides:

5B = 95

Divide by 5:

B = 19

Now that we know B, we can find A and S:

A = B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16

S = A - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14

So, I am 16 years old.

"To find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student will get: 
27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide 54 by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs:
54 ÷ 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all the students. 
6.75 → 7

So, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth with discrete time steps. 

Day 1: 
- 10 people are initially infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.
- Total infected = 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2:
- 70 people are infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections.
- Total infected = 70 (previous) + 420 (new) = 490.

Day 3:
- 490 people are infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections.
- Total infected = 490 (previous) + 2940 (new) = 3430.

Therefore, after three days, there are 3430 people infected.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Since it takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, Amber earns 1/2 of Claire's badges per month. So, Amber earns 1/2 * 1 = 0.5 badges per month. In a year, Amber earns 0.5 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns 3 * 1 = 3 badges per month. In a year, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. 

To find the total amount raised, multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 70 - 30 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is 110."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

Let's denote the number of red cars as R, the number of green cars as G, the number of blue cars as B, and the number of yellow cars as Y.

We know that:
R = 12 (given)
G = R - 2 (2 fewer green cars than red cars)
G = 12 - 2 = 10
B = 3G (3 times the number of green cars)
B = 3 * 10 = 30

Now, we know that the total number of cars is 75, so we can set up the equation:
R + G + B + Y = 75
12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75
52 + Y = 75
Y = 75 - 52
Y = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as x. 
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, the number of books Anne has is x - 12.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, the number of books Sofie has is (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2.

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Now, we know the weight of the sweet potatoes. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes.

Weight of carrots = weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will get. 

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since each box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by the cups per box to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we need to find out how much the jello will cost. We know the price per box is $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box.

Number of boxes needed: 12
Price per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 = $3500

The seller pays with $4000, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays 40% of the total cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the amount Keenan pays in a month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of pieces eaten on the first day: 
   2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces

2. Calculate the remaining pieces after the first day:
   60 - 24 = 36 pieces

3. Calculate the number of pieces eaten on the second day:
   10 pieces

4. Calculate the remaining pieces after the second day:
   36 - 10 = 26 pieces

5. Calculate 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day:
   (7/13) * 26 = 14.15 (round down to 14 since we can't eat a fraction of a piece)

6. Calculate the total number of pieces eaten:
   24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

The final answer is 48."
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda, we need to multiply the cost of 1 bottle of soda by 3. 

Cost of 1 bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

To find the cost of 2 bottles of water, we need to multiply the cost of 1 bottle of water by 2.

Cost of 1 bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water to find the total cost.

Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of 16 bolts is 16 * $0.03 = $0.48.

Now, we subtract the cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has: 
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00.

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find Ella's hourly rate, we need to divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked.

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work to find her total earnings.

Total earnings = Hourly rate * Number of hours
Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

The final answer is: $132"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we add the marbles Paul initially had to the marbles his friend gave him: 
52 + 28 = 80

Then, we calculate 1/4 of the total marbles Paul had after receiving the marbles from his friend:
1/4 * 80 = 20

Now, we subtract the marbles Paul lost from the total:
80 - 20 = 60

So, Paul has 60 marbles left.

60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the weighted sum of her scores for each type of question.

For multiple-choice questions:

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of money Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, we first need to calculate the total number of chickens he plans to sell. 

Since Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, we multiply 300 by 3/5:

300 * 3/5 = 300 * 0.6 = 180 chickens

Now, we know that Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each. To find the total amount of money he will make, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

180 * 50 = 9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we need to subtract this from the total amount of money he will make:

9000 - 2000 = 7000

This means Isaias needs $7000 to make a profit of $2000. 

To find the cost of the chicken he took to the market for sale, we divide the total cost by the number of chickens:

7000 / 180 = 38.89

So, Isaias bought the chicken he took to the market for sale for approximately $38.89."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's glasses from Julie's glasses.

14 (Julie's glasses) - 10.67 (Micah's glasses) = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is 3.33."
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the total cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount of money she has.

First, we need to find out how much money Sarah has. Since the rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter, we multiply 20 by 2 to get the total cost of the rope.

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, we need to find out how much money Sarah will spend on the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, so we multiply 20 meters by 1.5 to get the total cost of the new rope.

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah has.

$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

$10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's present age. 

Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. 

Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 18

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:
x = 18 - 10
x = 8

Now that we know Melanie's present age is 8, we can set up another equation to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age:
3x = ?

Substituting x = 8 into the equation, we get:
3(8) = 24

So, in 24 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

24"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

First, we know that 5 packs of bacon cost $10. 
Since 6 packets of chicken cost twice as much as a pack of bacon, 6 packets of chicken will cost 2 * $10 = $20.

Next, 3 packs of strawberries cost $4 each, so 3 packs of strawberries will cost 3 * $4 = $12.

Lastly, 7 packs of apples cost half the price of a pack of strawberries, so 7 packs of apples will cost 7 * ($4 / 2) = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in her cart: 
$10 (bacon) + $20 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $56

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget to find out how much money she has left:
$65 - $56 = $9

The final answer is $9."
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert.

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x.

We know that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, and it includes a 15-minute encore. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

Subtract 15 from both sides:

2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initial number of toys: 200

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many, so they make 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the total number of chimichangas made on those three days:
125 + 125 + 250 = 500

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can fit in pairs. 

Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, 80% of the microphones can be arranged in pairs. 

Number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs = 80% of 50
= 0.8 * 50
= 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:
40 / 2
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 
5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 
4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals

Now, subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 
40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to calculate one-fourth of 100.

100 * (1/4) = 25

So, there are 25 indoor plants.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining plants. 
100 - 25 = 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
75 * (2/3) = 50

Now, we need to find the number of flowering plants. 
75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we need to divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.

(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25%."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x meters per second.

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob (x), we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Whirligig speed = 5x
Whirligig speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig speed = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first find the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage of $10. 

$10 (original wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 (new wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can set up the equation 6x = total earnings from mowing lawns.

We know that Tasha made $80 in total, so the earnings from mowing lawns is 80 - 6 = 74.

Now we can set up the equation 6x = 74 and solve for x.

6x = 74
x = 74 / 6
x = 12.33

Since x represents the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, it must be a whole number. However, we can't have a fraction of a mow. This means that our initial assumption that x is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. Since the total number of lawns mowed is 3x + 5x = 8x, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is $74, we can set up the equation 8x = 74.

8x = 74
x = 74 / 8
x = 9.25

Again, x must be a whole number, so our initial assumption is still incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. Since the total number of lawns mowed is 3x + 5x = 8x, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is $74, we can set up the equation 8x = 74.

8x = 74
x = 74 / 8
x = 9.25

However, we can try to find a different combination of x that works. Let's try x = 9.

If x = 9, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 9 = 27 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 9 = 45 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 27 + 45 = 72, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 9 = 54.

Since 54 is less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 10.

If x = 10, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 10 = 30 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 10 = 50 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 30 + 50 = 80, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 10 = 60.

Since 60 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 11.

If x = 11, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 11 = 33 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 33 + 55 = 88, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 11 = 66.

Since 66 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.

If x = 12, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12 = 60 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 36 + 60 = 96, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12 = 72.

Since 72 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 13.

If x = 13, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 13 = 39 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 13 = 65 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 39 + 65 = 104, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 13 = 78.

Since 78 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.5.

If x = 12.5, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.5 = 37.5 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.5 = 62.5 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 37.5 + 62.5 = 100, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.5 = 75.

Since 75 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.67.

If x = 12.67, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.67 = 38 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.67 = 63.35 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38 + 63.35 = 101.35, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.67 = 75.02.

Since 75.02 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.67 + 0.01.

If x = 12.68, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.68 = 38.04 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.68 = 63.4 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.04 + 63.4 = 101.44, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.68 = 75.08.

Since 75.08 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.68 + 0.01.

If x = 12.69, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.69 = 38.07 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.69 = 63.45 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.07 + 63.45 = 101.52, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.69 = 75.14.

Since 75.14 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.69 + 0.01.

If x = 12.7, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.7 = 38.1 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.7 = 63.5 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.1 + 63.5 = 101.6, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.7 = 75.2.

Since 75.2 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.7 + 0.01.

If x = 12.71, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.71 = 38.13 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.71 = 63.55 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.13 + 63.55 = 101.68, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.71 = 75.26.

Since 75.26 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.71 + 0.01.

If x = 12.72, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.72 = 38.16 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.72 = 63.6 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.16 + 63.6 = 101.76, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.72 = 75.32.

Since 75.32 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.72 + 0.01.

If x = 12.73, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.73 = 38.19 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.73 = 63.65 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.19 + 63.65 = 101.84, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.73 = 75.38.

Since 75.38 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.73 + 0.01.

If x = 12.74, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.74 = 38.22 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.74 = 63.7 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.22 + 63.7 = 101.92, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.74 = 75.44.

Since 75.44 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.74 + 0.01.

If x = 12.75, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.75 = 38.25 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.75 = 63.75 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.25 + 63.75 = 102, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.75 = 75.5.

Since 75.5 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.75 + 0.01.

If x = 12.76, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.76 = 38.28 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.76 = 63.8 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.28 + 63.8 = 102.08, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.76 = 75.56.

Since 75.56 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.76 + 0.01.

If x = 12.77, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.77 = 38.31 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.77 = 63.85 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.31 + 63.85 = 102.16, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.77 = 75.62.

Since 75.62 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.77 + 0.01.

If x = 12.78, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.78 = 38.34 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.78 = 63.9 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.34 + 63.9 = 102.24, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.78 = 75.68.

Since 75.68 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.78 + 0.01.

If x = 12.79, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.79 = 38.37 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.79 = 64.95 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.37 + 64.95 = 103.32, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.79 = 75.74.

Since 75.74 is still less than 74, we need to try a larger value of x. Let's try x = 12.79 + 0.01.

If x = 12.8, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.8 = 38.4 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.8 = 64. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.4 + 64 = 102.4, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.8 = 76.

Since 76 is greater than 74, we can stop trying larger values of x.

Now that we know the total earnings from mowing lawns is 75.5, we can set up the equation 75.5 = 6x.

75.5 = 6x
x = 75.5 / 6
x = 12.5833

Since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 12 and x = 13.

If x = 12, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12 = 36 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12 = 60 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 36 + 60 = 96, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12 = 72.

Since 72 is less than 74, we can try x = 13.

If x = 13, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 13 = 39 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 13 = 65 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 39 + 65 = 104, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 13 = 78.

Since 78 is less than 74, we can try x = 12.5.

If x = 12.5, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.5 = 37.5 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.5 = 62.5 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 37.5 + 62.5 = 100, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.5 = 75.

Since 75 is less than 74, we can try x = 12.67.

If x = 12.67, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.67 = 38.01 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.67 = 63.35 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.01 + 63.35 = 101.36, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.67 = 75.02.

Since 75.02 is less than 74, we can try x = 12.67 + 0.01.

If x = 12.68, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.68 = 38.04 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.68 = 63.4 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.04 + 63.4 = 101.44, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.68 = 75.08.

Since 75.08 is less than 74, we can try x = 12.68 + 0.01.

If x = 12.69, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.69 = 38.07 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.69 = 63.45 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.07 + 63.45 = 101.52, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.69 = 75.14.

Since 75.14 is less than 74, we can try x = 12.69 + 0.01.

If x = 12.7, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.7 = 38.1 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.7 = 63.5 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.1 + 63.5 = 101.6, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is 6 * 12.7 = 75.2.

Since 75.2 is less than 74, we can try x = 12.7 + 0.01.

If x = 12.71, then Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x = 3 * 12.71 = 38.13 times and Alba's lawn 5x = 5 * 12.71 = 63.55 times. The total number of lawns mowed is 38.13 + 63.55 = "
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the steps:

"To find the total distance Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance and add it to Dijana's distance.

Dijana's distance = 50 miles
1/5 of Dijana's distance = 1/5 * 50 = 10 miles
Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + 1/5 of Dijana's distance
Anis's distance = 50 + 10 = 60 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance both of them rowed.
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

"To find out how many bowls of soup Calvin has, we need to know how many bowls he has in total. Since he can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that he has 4x or 8x bowls of soup. 

Since Calvin is an adult, his wife is also an adult, and there are two children, that makes a total of 4 adults. 

Since Calvin can fill 4 bowls with the soup, we can say that he has 4x bowls of soup. 

Now, we need to find out how many bowls of soup are left after everyone eats one bowl. Since there are 4 adults, 4x - 4 = 4x - 4 bowls of soup left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining soup by the number of children, which is 2. 

So, (4x - 4) / 2 = 2x - 2 bowls of soup left for the children.

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't give an exact answer. However, we can say that each child can have 2x - 2 bowls of soup for lunch.

The final answer is: 2"

Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8

The total amount William spent is $8."
"To find the total amount of material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 
Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is 2/4 = 0.5 yards.
For 20 small masks, the total material needed is 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards.

For large masks: 
Since Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is 2.25/3 = 0.75 yards.
For 8 large masks, the total material needed is 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards.

The total material needed for 20 small and 8 large masks is 10 + 6 = 16 yards.

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so in a day, he sleeps for 10 hours.
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the total hours he spends on these activities from the total hours in a day:
24 (total hours in a day) - 10 (sleeping hours) - 8 (working hours) - 1 (walking hours) = 5

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day."
"To find the number of blue shoe boxes left, we subtract the number of blue shoe boxes used from the total number of blue shoe boxes: 
7 - 3 = 4

To find the number of red shoe boxes left, we first need to find 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes:
1/3 * 9 = 3

Now, we subtract the number of red shoe boxes used from the total number of red shoe boxes:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Adam's current age. 

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A. 

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8
60 = 2A
A = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of both farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day will be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

"To find the total time John spends on sudoku, we need to calculate the time for the normal sudoku and the extreme sudoku.

Time for normal sudoku: 45 minutes
Time for extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Total time spent on sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 0.5 to find the number of bottles he drinks.

Number of bottles = Total time / 0.5
= 225 minutes / 0.5
= 450

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total. We know that he threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. 

Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We are given that R = 20. 

We can set up the equation based on the total number of bologna pieces thrown:

2R + 3Y = 58

Substituting R = 20 into the equation:

2(20) + 3Y = 58
40 + 3Y = 58

Now, we can solve for Y:

3Y = 58 - 40
3Y = 18
Y = 18 / 3
Y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days.

Total miles driven = miles driven per day * number of days
Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find the number of round trips he can make in 8 hours.

8 hours / 4 hours per round trip = 2 round trips

Since the sloth makes a round trip (down and back up), we need to find the number of one-way trips. 

2 round trips / 2 = 1 one-way trip

Now, we know the sloth can make 1 round trip in 4 hours. We also know he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. 

To find the number of berries he can pick per round trip, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of round trips.

24 berries / 2 round trips = 12 berries per round trip

Since the sloth makes 1 round trip, we can divide the number of berries per round trip by 2 to find the number of berries he can pick per one-way trip.

12 berries per round trip / 2 = 6 berries per one-way trip

The final answer is 6."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water in the tank initially: 
   Since they fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool,

2. Calculate the total amount of water used from the tank in 6 days:
   The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so in 6 days, 
   the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

3. Calculate the remaining amount of water in the tank:
   The initial amount of water in the tank was 5000 gallons, and 3000 gallons were used, 
   so the remaining amount of water in the tank is 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the remaining budget for Colby to spend on movies.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent:
- 5 movies on a Friday: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Remaining budget: $150 - $130 = $20

Since Colby wants to buy popcorn and candy tonight, let's subtract the cost of these items from his remaining budget:
- Popcorn: $8
- Candy: $2
Total cost of popcorn and candy: $8 + $2 = $10

Remaining budget after buying popcorn and candy: $20 - $10 = $10

Now, Colby can spend the remaining $10 on movie tickets. Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, he can buy 1 ticket tonight.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we multiply the number of mini pastries by their respective calories:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the total number of Junebugs removed, we need to add the number of Junebugs removed each day.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on each of those days. 
So, the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add the total number of Junebugs removed:

"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

The bus traveled 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.
The car traveled 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

To find the difference, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has.

First, let's add the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings: 
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this total from the total number of toys Sophie now has: 
62 (total toys) - 48 (toys already had) = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to each person's age. Let's say Peter's age is P, Paul's age is P + 10 (since Paul is 10 years older than Jean), and Jean's age is P - 10 (since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age).

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We can write this as an equation:

P + (P + 10) + (P - 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

3P = 100

Divide both sides by 3:

P = 100 / 3
P = 33.33

So, Peter's age is approximately 33.33 years.

The final answer is: 33.33"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to follow the steps:

1. Maria and her 4 friends initially had 1 + 4 = 5 balloons.
2. Then, each person received 3 more balloons, so the total number of balloons for Maria and her friends is 5 * 5 = 25.
3. Maria also had 1 balloon, so the total number of balloons is 25 + 1 = 26.

The total number of balloons is 26."
"To find the total number of boxes, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance spat by Zoey, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet

To find the total distance spat by Sydney, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 
35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances spat by both Zoey and Sydney: 
400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 
820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To calculate the production rates, we need to multiply the number of widgets each machine makes per hour by the number of hours it runs per day and then by the number of days in the month.

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

To find the difference in earnings, subtract the earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the earnings of the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To calculate the cost, we first need to determine the number of hours Cameron will be staying after the 12-hour mark. 

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will be staying for 18 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day).

Since the 12-hour mark is already included in the initial 1000 pesos, we need to calculate the additional hours after 12 hours. 
18 hours (total stay) - 12 hours (included in the initial rate) = 6 hours

The cost for the additional 6 hours is 6 hours * 70 pesos per hour = 420 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron would be the initial 1000 pesos plus the additional 420 pesos, which equals 1420 pesos.

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour option, the cost would be 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is 1600 - 1420 = 180 pesos."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we need to calculate the amount of hay for each type of animal and then add them together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds. Since there are 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of hay needed for goats and sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much John earned, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked.

John's earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Now, let's subtract the cost of gas and the cost of pencils from his earnings.

Remaining money = 300 dollars - 50 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining money.

Remaining money after deposit = 200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

Now, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money.

Number of pens = 100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total:
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows.

Number of children in each row = 8
Number of rows = 7

Total number of children = 8 * 7 = 56

There can be 56 children in the drill."
"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons: 9 coupons * 100 bottles per coupon = 900 bottles.
2. Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students: 29 students * 2 bottles per student = 58 bottles.
3. Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can redeem: 900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into parts:

1. Labor cost: 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75
2. Parts cost: $60
3. Total fixed cost: $40 (visit charge) + $60 (parts) = $100
4. Total labor cost: $78.75
5. Total cost: $100 (fixed cost) + $78.75 (labor cost) = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the amount he got back from selling 5 of them.

Original price of 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150
Discount on 10 CDs = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price James paid for 10 CDs = $150 - $60 = $90

Now, let's calculate the amount James got back from selling 5 CDs:
Price of 5 CDs = 5 * $40 = $200

Since James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, he actually sold them for $200, not $40. This means he sold them at a loss.

To find the actual loss, we need to subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid for the CDs:
Loss = $90 - $200 = -$110

Since James lost $110, he is out of money.

Final answer: -$110"
"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of root crop and then add them together.

For the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9
For the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20
For the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the total amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed * Time
Since James swims 60% of the total distance, we need to find 60% of 20 miles.
Distance = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Time = 0.5 * Time
Time = 0.5 * 6 hours
Time = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Step 4: Calculate the time James takes to swim the remaining distance at half the speed.
New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 5: Calculate the total time James takes to get across the lake.
Total time = Time to swim the first part + Time to rest + Time to swim the second part
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we subtract the stickers she lost: 15 - 7 = 8
Then, we add the stickers her teacher gave her: 8 + 5 = 13

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"To calculate the commission, we need to first calculate the total revenue from the sales of each newspaper.

For the New York Times:
6 copies * $5 = $30
Commission on the New York Times: 10% of $30 = 0.1 * $30 = $3

For the Wall Street Journal:
10 copies * $15 = $150
Commission on the Wall Street Journal: 8% of $150 = 0.08 * $150 = $12

Total commission: $3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is $15."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given. 

Let's denote Leo's age as L, Marcus's age as M, and Deanna's age as D. 

We know that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so M = 0.5L.

Additionally, Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5.

Now we can substitute the value of M from the second equation into the third equation: 
0.5L = D - 5
0.5L = 26 - 5
0.5L = 21

To find Leo's age, we multiply both sides by 2:
L = 2 * 21
L = 42

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say Azibo scored x points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored x + 20 points. Dinar scored 10 points less than Bahati, so Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.

We know that the total points scored by the three team members is 45. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

So Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to first find the number of pages per inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

Now, we know the book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the number of pages, we multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch.

Number of pages = Thickness of the book * Number of pages per inch
= 1.5 * 2
= 3

The book has 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total time spent stapling reports.

First, we need to find the total hours worked. 
11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to convert 15 hours to minutes. 
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports stapled.
900 minutes / 15 minutes/report = 60 reports.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she slept and subtract the time she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the total time she usually sleeps in a day:
10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours. 
8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time she slept that day:
She woke up at 2:15 a.m. and went to sleep at 2:38 a.m. 
The time she slept is 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. 
So, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the time she slept:
23 minutes - 5 minutes = 18 minutes

Now, let's add the time she slept that day to her usual total sleep time:
480 minutes (usual sleep time) + 18 minutes (time slept that day) = 498 minutes

The final answer is: 498"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has 2 dozen cups, we first convert 2 dozen to the total number of cups: 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we find 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups.

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, the initial number of occupied beds is 200.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted will be 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity.

Total capacity = 1000 beds
Total occupied beds = 900 beds

Number of unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
= 1000 - 900
= 100 beds

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. Since she sends 7 work emails, we subtract that from the total number of emails she sends in a day:
16 (total emails) - 7 (work emails) = 9

2. Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining emails are to her family. Since two-thirds of the remainder are to family, we multiply the remainder by 2/3:
9 (remainder) * 2/3 = 6

3. Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. Since one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend, we multiply the remainder by 1/3:
9 (remainder) * 1/3 = 3

So, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. We know Aliya is 3 years old.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years.

Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the original number of people (48) and subtract it from the original number.

20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:

48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is 38.4."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of balls that Jeffrey picked up and carried. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up an equation to find the number of balls Jeffrey carried:

Let x be the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls.
We know Jason carried 2 balls, so 2x = 2.
Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Now that we know Jeffrey carried 1 ball, we can find the total number of balls carried by the three boys:
Jason carried 2 balls, and Jeffrey carried 1 ball, so together they carried 2 + 1 = 3 balls.
Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.
The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 3 + 4 = 7.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation: 4 * 31 = total holes on the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124

Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, the total number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 (the holes dug by the end of the third day) = 93 holes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, we can set up an equation.

Let's say the number of corn chips each person got is x. Since Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so the total number of corn chips they got is 70 + 70 = 140.

Since there are three people, the total number of corn chips is 3x. We can set up the equation:

3x = 140 + 15 (since Collins got 15 more than the others)

3x = 155

To find x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 155 / 3
x = 51.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a corn chip, we can round down to 51. However, in this case, we can't use this value for x because it would mean that Collins got 66 corn chips (51 + 15), which is not the case.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others. We can set up the equation:

Amora + Lainey + Collins = Total

70 + 70 + (x + 15) = Total

140 + x + 15 = Total

155 + x = Total

We know that the total number of corn chips is 3x. We can set up the equation:

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others. We can set up the equation:

Amora + Lainey + Collins = Total

70 + 70 + (x + 15) = Total

140 + x + 15 = Total

155 + x = Total

We know that the total number of corn chips is 3x. We can set up the equation:

3x = 155 + x

Subtract x from both sides:

2x = 155

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given the following information:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the expression for X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each direction and then add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first leg of the journey (southerly direction):
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

For the second leg of the journey (northerly direction):
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

For the third leg of the journey (southerly direction):
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled by the bird. Since the bird traveled south for the first 300 miles and then north for 36 miles, we need to subtract the northward distance from the southward distance to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.
Total distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total distance = 264 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially had 1 dozen brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, let's subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the age of Nani's brother, we need to multiply Nani's age by 2. 
Nani's brother's age = 8 * 2 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age.
25% of 8 = 0.25 * 8 = 2 years.
Nani's sister's age = 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together.
Total age = Nani's age + Nani's brother's age + Nani's sister's age
Total age = 8 + 16 + 6
Total age = 30 years.

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

"To find out how much money Tyler needs to buy the books, we need to add the costs of the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook.

$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has $14, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs.

$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25

Now, we know Tyler needs $25 more to afford the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$25 (amount needed) ÷ $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard has. 

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up the equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries, we can set up the equation:

Jerry's cherries + 50 = 60
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday and Sunday.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday. So, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is A + 4.

We also know that Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday. So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5.

We are given that Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday. So, G = 10.

We can now find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday: A = G - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6.

We can now find the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday: G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

We can now find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday: A + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

Total earnings on Saturday = (G * 6) + (A * 15) = (10 * 6) + (6 * 15) = 60 + 90 = 150.

Total earnings on Sunday = (G + 5) * 6 + (A + 4) * 15 = (15 * 6) + (10 * 15) = 90 + 150 = 240.

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday = 150 + 240 = 390.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

From point 1, we know E = 19.

From point 2, when Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be twice Emil's age at that time. So, D + 5 = 2 * 24, since 24 - 19 = 5. 
D = 2 * 24 - 5
D = 43

From point 3, when Emil turns 24, his brother's age will be half of his dad's age at that time. So, B + 5 = (D + 5) / 2
B + 5 = (43 + 5) / 2
B + 5 = 48 / 2
B + 5 = 24
B = 19

Now, we have the current ages of Emil, his dad, and his brother: E = 19, D = 43, and B = 19.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is D + B = 43 + 19 = 62.

"To find the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

First, convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space each plant occupies: 
12 inches (plant width) + 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot (space between plants) = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the flower bed in inches by the space each plant occupies: 
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be: 
27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.
90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Time to cook 90 shrimp: 
Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we divide 90 by 30 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp.
90 / 30 = 3 minutes

Since these tasks are done sequentially, we add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp.
15 minutes (peeling) + 3 minutes (cooking) = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Answer: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the total cooling effect is 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, warming the room 3 degrees per hour. So, the total warming effect is 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour. So, the total warming effect is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net effect is the difference between the cooling and warming effects: 6 - 12 - 4 = -10 degrees.

The final answer is -10."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 
2. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, we can say that Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet is x + 30.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill's age at that time is 3(x + 30).
4. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3(x + 30) - x = 75.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 90 - x = 75.
6. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 90 = 75.
7. Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get 2x = -15.
8. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = -7.5.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Buford writes 48 checks per year."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can calculate the total number of flights made by the first plane as 44 * 2 = 88.

The first plane makes three-quarters of its flights to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is 88 * (3/4) = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Since the total number of flights is 88, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22.

Therefore, the first plane makes 22 flights to France in one day.

"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam initially bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that the total age of the children is 20. We know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, so we can subtract their ages from the total age to find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred.

Combined age of Helene and Wilfred = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age)
Combined age of Helene and Wilfred = 20 - (3 + 4)
Combined age of Helene and Wilfred = 20 - 7
Combined age of Helene and Wilfred = 13

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as 'x'. Since there are 4 children, the total age of the group is 4x. We know that Helene's age is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2x.

We can set up an equation using the combined age of Helene and Wilfred and the fact that Helene's age is twice the average age:

2x + Wilfred's age = 13

We also know that the total age of the group is 20, so we can set up another equation:

4x = 20

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 20 / 4
x = 5

Now that we know the average age, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2x
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can find Wilfred's age:

Wilfred's age = Combined age of Helene and Wilfred - Helene's age
Wilfred's age = 13 - 10
Wilfred's age = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first find out the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute to Walter's total collection.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times the amount Walter has collected so far. 
3 * 2000 = 6000

However, Walter's friend is going to give him $200. So, we need to subtract $200 from Walter's lawyer's contribution.
6000 - 200 = 5800

The final answer is 5800."
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate 1/2 of 100 guests' cookies.

1/2 of 100 guests' cookies = (1/2) * 100 = 50 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people.

Number of people in the church = 50 cookies / 15 cookies per person
= 50 / 15
= 3.33 (round down to 3 since you can't have a fraction of a person)

So, there were 3 people in the church next door.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is x. Then, the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Since each slice is a fraction of the whole watermelon, we can assume the whole watermelon is 1 (or 100%). To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices for the adults by the total number of slices and multiply by 100:

(4 slices / 6 slices) * 100 = 66.67%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 66.67."
"To find the total time spent on tasks, we need to calculate the time spent on inpatients and appointments.

Time spent on inpatients: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent on tasks: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total available time:
9 hours (total time) - 8 hours (time spent) = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations. Let's say the number of chocolate bars in a box is 'x'. 

Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Since Peter sold 4.5 boxes, he sold 4.5x chocolate bars.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. So, we can set up the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms:

8x = 64

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

Total cost:
- Studio rental cost per week: $25 * 3 days = $75
- Total cost per week: $75 + (10 students * $1.50 per student) = $75 + $15 = $90
- Total cost per month: $90 * 4 weeks = $360

Total revenue:
- Number of students: 10
- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Total sessions per month: 10 students * 3 sessions = 30 sessions
- Revenue per session: $25 + $1.50 = $26.50
- Total revenue per month: 30 sessions * $26.50 per session = $795

Expected earnings of the dance studio in a month: $795 - $360 = $435

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chocolate bars in each box. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. 

Since Peter has 4 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x. 
Since Martha has 7 boxes, the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7x.

We are given that Peter has 64 chocolate bars and Martha has 56 chocolate bars. 

So, we can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of each equation by the coefficient of x.

x = 64 / 4
x = 56 / 7
x = 16

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha.

The difference is 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

3/5 of 50 = (3/5) * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born will be:

30 female porcupines * 4 babies/female porcupine * 12 months = 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we need to add the initial population of porcupines to the number of babies born:

50 (initial population) + 1440 (babies born) = 1490

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool.

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume * 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons * 0.10
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to find the number of blue sticks first. 

Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 
55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 
45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The difference in distance traveled is 230 miles."
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information step by step.

1. Total students: 3000
2. Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old
4. Remaining students over 16 years old are female: 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old
5. Half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students
6. One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old
7. Remaining students under 16 years old are female: 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old
8. Total female students: 1125 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1875

The final answer is: 1875"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's start with the first 5 hours. Since the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour, we can calculate the remaining capacity after 5 hours as follows:

Initial capacity = 100%
Remaining capacity after 5 hours = 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, let's consider the last 3 hours. Since the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour, we can calculate the remaining capacity after 3 hours as follows:

Remaining capacity after 3 hours = 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining was 28% at the end, we can set up an equation to find the initial capacity:

Initial capacity - 34% = 28%
Initial capacity = 28% + 34% = 62%

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 62%."
"To calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate her total weekly earnings and then find 20% of the car's price.

Total weekly earnings = (wages per hour * hours worked per week) + (tips per hour * hours worked per week)
Total weekly earnings = ($10/hour * 40 hours/week) + ($15/hour * 40 hours/week)
Total weekly earnings = $400 + $600
Total weekly earnings = $1000

Now, let's calculate 20% of the car's price:
20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we'll divide the down payment amount by her total weekly earnings:
Number of weeks = Down payment amount / Total weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $2,000 / $1,000
Number of weeks = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
3 peaches * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears * $0.75 = $3
2 kiwis * $1 = $2
5 apples * $0.75 = $3.75
Total cost of fruits already bought = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, we subtract the total cost of the fruits he already bought from his initial amount:
$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25

Since Jamaar can't spend a negative amount, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy any more fruits."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the compound interest formula:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where:
A = final price
P = initial price = $120
r = annual increase rate = 5% = 0.05
n = number of years = 3

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = 120(1.05)^3
A = 120(1.157625)
A = 139.74

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $140.

Final answer: $140"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to find the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

18"
"To find the time James spends reading, we need to first find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. 

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to get the time it takes to read one page. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we know it takes James 3.33 minutes to read one page. To find the total time James spends reading, we multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages he reads.

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. The hotel initially had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which means 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. The total number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2.
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9.

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals as 'x' and the number of small stuffed animals as '2x' since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the total revenue from small stuffed animals is 2x * $4 = $8x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so it's 3 * $4 = $12.

The total revenue from large stuffed animals is x * $12 = $12x.

The total revenue from both large and small stuffed animals is $120. So, we can set up the equation:

$8x + $12x = $120

Combine like terms:

$20x = $120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Since the number of small stuffed animals is 2x, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day

Now, multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found by the friends.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 were not found by the friends. So, the number of eggs the friends found is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month.

1. First, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 
Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 
With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more ore than with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.

2. Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine per day with steel pickaxes. 
40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

3. To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month, we multiply the daily amount by 30 days. 
40 dwarves can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in a month."
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then use that to calculate the price of the third package.

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package to find its price: 
$1.50 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, we need to calculate 10% of the remaining amount owed:
10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 balloons

   Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
   Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 balloons

   Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6

3. Calculate the number of blue balloons added:
   75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 balloons

   Total balloons = 15 (red) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 27

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 
   - Probability of normal teacher coming in: 60% (100% - 50% chance of substitute teacher)
   - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension)
   - Probability of not getting an extension and not having to turn in homework: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36

2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension:
   - Probability of normal teacher coming in: 60% (100% - 50% chance of substitute teacher)
   - Probability of getting an extension: 40%
   - Probability of getting an extension and having to turn in homework: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24

3. The substitute teacher comes in:
   - Probability of substitute teacher coming in: 50%
   - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension)
   - Probability of not getting an extension and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add the probabilities of the three scenarios:
0.36 + 0.24 + 0.3 = 0.9

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.9 * 100 = 90%

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 90%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of small beans Grandpa can eat. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans is 2 * 75 = 150.

Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, the number of small beans is 150 * 3 = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of bottles to find the number of intervals between the bottles:

8 bottles - 1 = 7 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next:

7 intervals * 5 seconds per interval = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of apples, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes.

Total apples = 40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Next, let's calculate the total cost of Mozzarella cheese:
3 pounds * $6 per pound = $18

Now, let's add the costs of both cheeses:
$22 (Parmesan) + $18 (Mozzarella) = $40

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from Amor's initial $50:
$50 - $40 = $10

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had worked during the 4 years of college.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had worked during college:

$25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000

Since his college degree tripled his income, his new income would be:

$25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he would have earned if he had worked during college:

$75,000 per year * 4 years = $300,000

The total amount of money lost from not working while in school is the difference between the amount he would have earned and the amount he actually earned:

$300,000 - $100,000 = $200,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to repay the loans:

$50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000

Since the amount of money lost from not working while in school is equal to the amount of money needed to repay the loans, we can say that the opportunity cost of going to college is equal to the amount of money lost from not working while in school.

To find out how long it would take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we can divide the total amount of money lost by the amount of money he earns per year after college:

$200,000 / $75,000 per year = 2.67 years

So, it would take Jim approximately 2.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Final answer: 2.67"
"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric separately and then add them together.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so they will be 8 feet long by 10 feet wide.

The area of the first piece of fabric is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.
The area of the second piece of fabric is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the total area by 2.
Total area = 80 + 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209.

Now, let's add the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 
425 + 102 + 209 = 736.

The final answer is: 736"

Now, let's add the costs together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's find out how much he won in the second race. He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, which is $5. 
So, he won 2 * $5 = $10, and then $1 more than that, which is $10 + $1 = $11.

Now, let's find out how much he lost in the third race. He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, which is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's add up the total amount he lost:
$5 (first race) + $11 (second race) + $16.50 (third race) = $32.50

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races:
$32.50 / 3 = $10.83

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $10.83."

First, multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country: 
26 * 5 = 130

Then, multiply the result by the population per city: 
130 * 1000 = 130,000

The total population in South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first convert their heights to the same unit. Since Xavier's height is given in feet and inches, we'll convert it to inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches
Xavier's height in inches = 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
Xavier's growth in inches = 3 inches
Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Now, we have Cole's height in inches: 50 inches
Cole's growth in inches = 2 inches
Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference in height = Cole's new height - Xavier's new height
= 52 inches - 51 inches
= 1 inch

The final answer is 1."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount the first person took as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The sum of the amounts taken by all three people is $1920, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3
x = 586.67

So the first person took $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, we need to find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to hours and multiply it by the number of days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Since they worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the hours by 3:
9 hours * 3 = 27 hours

Now, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:
27 hours / 4 painters = 6.75 hours per painter

The final answer is 6.75."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of balls retrieved in each set. 

Let x be the number of balls retrieved in the second set. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls retrieved in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: Initial price = $20,000
Depreciation for 2007 = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2008: Initial price = $15,800
Depreciation for 2008 = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2009: Initial price = $12,482
Depreciation for 2009 = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,865.58."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of non-Spanish books. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 
50 - 25 - 5 = 20

There are 20 Spanish books."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

First, we'll subtract 325 from 1955:
1955 - 325 = 1630

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Since Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days to get the total cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total cups to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initial number of people on the train: 120
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train: 120 + 20 = 140
3. At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and twice that number (100) boarded the train: 140 - 50 + 100 = 190
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train: 190 - 80 = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: 
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt). 

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost.

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12.

Yearly cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To calculate the number of loads, we need to first calculate the total number of sets of sheets Greg uses in a year.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 

For twin beds, he uses 4 sets per week. 
For king beds, he uses 1 set per week.

Total sets per week = 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets per week

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, the total number of loads per week is:
- 2 twin sets / 2 = 1 load for twin sets
- 1 king set / 1 = 1 load for king sets

Total loads per week = 1 (twin) + 1 (king) = 2 loads per week

Total loads per year = 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads per year

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched in a weekend = 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to calculate the stickers he had two years ago, last year, and this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find Silvia's slices by multiplying Jake's slices by 2:
Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, let's use the variables x to represent the time Donovan spent on the meal. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can represent Betsy's time as x + 18.

We know that the total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since x represents Donovan's time, we can find Betsy's time by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's time = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the costs:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the 30-minute visit: 
   - The doctor charges $300/hour, so for 30 minutes, it's $300/2 = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: 
   - The doctor charges $4/pill, and assuming 30 painkillers, it's $4 * 30 = $120
4. The cost of the parking: 
   - The doctor charges $6/hour, and the visit is for 2 hours, so it's $6 * 2 = $12

Now, let's add up the costs:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find the number of emails James responds to, we need to first find the number of emails that don't require a response. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, we subtract the non-responsive emails from the total: 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James gets 80 emails a day, we multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by 5: 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."

The average score is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team separately, then subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 pizzas = 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
80% of 40 pizzas = 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Total pizzas eaten = 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

Total pizzas ordered = 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

Pizzas left = Total pizzas ordered - Total pizzas eaten
= 60 - 46
= 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."

The total cost of postage is $245.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches remaining is 7 - 4 = 3.
3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.
4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched.

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

The total amount of fertiliser delivered is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To calculate the cost of the butter, we need to first determine how many pounds of butter Dennis will need. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To calculate the cost, we can divide the total pounds of butter needed (6) by 2, since the promotion is for every 2 pounds. 6 / 2 = 3. 

Since Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds of butter for every 2 pounds, he will pay for 3 sets of 1.5 pounds. 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 pounds of butter.

The cost of 4.5 pounds of butter is 4.5 * $4.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. 
Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

However, 4 people said they could not come. 
Number of guests = 45 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. 
Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21
Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126
Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first find out how much money they initially had.

Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, she spent 1/4 of her money. Let's call the total amount of money she had 'x'. Then, the amount she spent is 1/4x.

Riza spent 1/3 of her money, so the amount she spent is 1/3x.

Since they each had $60, we can set up the equation:

x - 1/4x = 60
x - 1/3x = 60

To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for 4 and 3, which is 12. 

Multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to eliminate the fractions:
12x - 3x = 720
9x = 720

Now, divide both sides by 9:
x = 80

So, Maggie and Riza initially had $80 each.

Now, let's find out how much they have left:
Maggie's remaining money: 80 - 20 = 60
Riza's remaining money: 80 - 26.67 = 53.33

The total amount of money they have left is 60 + 53.33 = 113.33"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Now, we need to find out how many bananas are left for the third monkey. 
The total number of bananas is 315. 
The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. 
So, the third monkey eats 315 - 24 = 291 bananas per day.

However, since the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, we need to divide the total bananas by 7 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day. 
291 / 7 = 41.57 bananas per day.

Since we can't have a fraction of a banana, we can round down to 41 bananas per day.

The final answer is 41."
"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second 500-piece puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

In the second 500-piece puzzle, he placed all 500 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

"To find out how much Jenny spent on roses, we first need to calculate the cost of the roses. 

A dozen roses costs $15, and she bought 15 roses. Since 15 is more than a dozen, we need to calculate the cost of 12 roses and then add the cost of 3 more roses.

The cost of 12 roses is $15. 
The cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. 
The total cost of 15 roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, so she has 5 * $5 = $25. 
She spent $21 on roses, so she has $25 - $21 = $4 left.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the remaining $4 into quarters. 
There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we divide $4 by 0.25 (the value of a quarter). 
$4 / 0.25 = 16 quarters.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and then add them together.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time elapsed until the second train arrives is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, and it stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed. The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, so it arrives at 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. The time elapsed until the third train arrives is 50 - 30 = 20 minutes.

3. The third train arrives 1 hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves. Since the second train arrived at 50 minutes, the third train arrives at 50 + 60 = 110 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the time elapsed until the fourth train arrives is 110 - 110 = 0 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Since the third train leaves at 110 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 110 + 20 = 130 minutes.

So, Paul will wait for 130 minutes for his train."
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required for the sculpture (200).

200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the remaining number of toothpicks needed (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks needed for the sculpture.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. We can calculate the selling price:

Selling price = Original price * 1.20
Selling price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Selling price = $3200

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Selling price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

Since we are looking for the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount percentage = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Discount percentage = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Discount percentage = -20%

The negative sign indicates that the friend obtained a discount, but we are only interested in the percentage value, so we can ignore the negative sign.

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours. 

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 60 seconds in 1 minute. 

So, there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in 1 hour. 

Multiply this by 4 hours to get the total number of seconds: 3600 * 4 = 14400 seconds.

Now, we know that each spring creates one jellyfish every second. So, in 14400 seconds, 5 springs would create 5 * 14400 jellyfish.

5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

The final answer is 72000."
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway, he covered half of the total distance, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since James walked back home, he covered the same distance of 2 miles. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

The total time it took James to reach the store and come back home is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Total time = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours
Total time = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually:
10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas
40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches:
10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

"To find the rate of growth, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4 years).

Rate of growth = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply the price of each type by the number sold.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * (1/2) = 300 * (1/2) = 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15 = 300 * 0.15 = 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= 67500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= 11250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB bike
= 105 * 500
= 52500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= 67500 + 11250 + 52500
= 132500

The final answer is: 132500"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes for the classes and the extra learning time.

Total minutes for classes: 
6 classes * 40 minutes per class = 240 minutes
Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, we multiply the total minutes by 5:
240 minutes * 5 = 1200 minutes

Extra learning time:
1/16 of the total minutes in a week is spent on Saturday and Sunday. 
There are 1680 minutes in a week (60 minutes * 7 days). 
1/16 of 1680 is 105 minutes. 
Since John spends this extra time on both Saturday and Sunday, we multiply by 2:
105 minutes * 2 = 210 minutes

Total minutes spent learning per week:
1200 minutes (classes) + 210 minutes (extra learning) = 1410 minutes

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1410 minutes / 60 = 23.5 hours

The final answer is 23.5."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

Now, we need to find the height of the ball on its second bounce. The ball will reach 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we convert 6 feet to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.
2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.
3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.
4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Now, we multiply the total number of bags sold by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, which is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the amount left after the T-Rex ate is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the initial amount is 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To calculate the probability, we need to consider the total number of sodas and the number of shaken sodas left.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, when Ellen's friend comes, there are 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas left.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/9) * 100 = 22.22%

The final answer is 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add them together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

To find the total distance between the two trains, we add the distances they have traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to work and the number of people he can help per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of days in March: 31 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 31 days:
20% of 31 = 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

Now, let's calculate the number of days Billy is available to work:
31 days - 6 days = 25 days

Billy can help 2 people per hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he can help per day is:
2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people/day

Now, we can multiply the number of days Billy is available to work by the number of people he can help per day:
25 days * 6 people/day = 150 people

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

Number of people in buses: 12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people
Number of people in cars: 20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Total number of people: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people

The final answer is: 480"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to create a system of linear equations.

Let's denote Martha's age as M, Jeff's age as J, and Mike's age as m.

From the information given, we have two equations:

1. J = M + 10 (Jeff is 10 years older than Martha)
2. M = m - 4 (Martha is 4 years younger than Mike)

We are also given that Mike is 24 years old, so m = 24.

Substituting m = 24 into the second equation, we get:
M = 24 - 4
M = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can substitute M = 20 into the first equation to find Jeff's age:
J = 20 + 10
J = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this total time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5.

1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance covered by all three is 52 miles. 
We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. 
So, the distance covered by Ahito is 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"To find the new balance, we need to follow the steps:

1. Calculate the discount on the frying pan:
   Original price: $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

2. Calculate the discount on the towels:
   Original price: $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

3. Calculate the total cost of the new purchases:
   Frying pan: $16.00
   Towels: $27.00
   Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - (x/5) = (4/5)*x.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6*15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information:

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

Caroline is 24 years old."
"To calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work, we need to first calculate her annual retirement savings. 

Annual salary: $100,000
Savings rate: 20%
Annual savings: $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000

Since Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual living expenses will be:
$100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000

Now, let's calculate her annual retirement income:
Annual retirement savings: $20,000
Annual living expenses: $40,000
Annual retirement income needed: $40,000

Since Lauren's annual retirement savings is less than her annual living expenses, she needs to increase her savings rate. However, we will continue with the given information.

Annual retirement savings: $20,000
Annual retirement income needed: $40,000
Number of years for retirement: 20 years

To calculate the total amount needed for retirement, we multiply the annual retirement income needed by the number of years:
Total amount needed for retirement: $40,000 * 20 = $800,000

Now, we can calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save each year:
Total amount needed for retirement: $800,000
Number of years: 20
Total annual savings: $20,000

To find the number of years Lauren needs to work, we can divide the total amount needed for retirement by her annual savings:
Number of years to work: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years

However, Lauren is currently 0 years old (assuming she started saving at age 0), and she wants to retire in 20 years. So, she needs to work for 40 years to save enough for her desired retirement.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since 40% of the students are boys, and we know that 240 boys make up 40% of the school, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

The number of girls in the school is the total number of students minus the number of boys:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"

"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total distance she wants to hike (9,300 miles) by the number of days in June (30 days). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is planning to hike twice a day, we need to divide the daily target by 2.

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per day

Now, we need to find out how many miles Soledad is currently hiking per day. We know she hikes 125 miles twice a day, so we multiply the daily target by 2.

125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we subtract the current daily target from the required daily target.

155 miles - 250 miles = -95 miles

Since Soledad cannot hike a negative number of miles, we need to re-evaluate her current hiking schedule. It seems that she is already hiking more than the required 155 miles per day."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. 

First, we need to find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. We can do this by dividing the number of blinks by the time it took to blink those blinks.

Rate = 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

Time = Total blinks / Rate
Time = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute
Time = 9 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 400 toys are ordered, the fifth worker must produce 400 - 220 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

Total M&M's = 3 large bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, to find the number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam's current age is 16, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Since Vince's age 2 years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is 9 years old now."
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's represent the number of eggs Sarah painted as 'x'. Then, the number of eggs Camden painted would be 'x + 12'. 

Since the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30, we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms: 
2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides: 
2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted as 'y'. Since the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, we can write the equation: 
y + y + 9 + 21 = 56

Combine like terms: 
2y + 30 = 56

Subtract 30 from both sides: 
2y = 26

Divide both sides by 2: 
y = 13

So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and the number of eggs Arnold painted: 
21 - 13 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will need and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to find the number of boxes: 
200 / 8 = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight of each box to find the total weight of the crayons:
25 * 8 = 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight of the crayons by 16 to find the weight in pounds:
200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons is 12.5 pounds. Since the boxes also weigh 8 ounces each, we need to convert the weight of the boxes to pounds:
8 ounces / 16 = 0.5 pounds per box

Now, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight of each box in pounds:
25 * 0.5 = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the boxes is 12.5 pounds. To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes:
12.5 + 12.5 = 25 pounds

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we divide 64 feet by 4 to get the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Each log has 5 planks, so we multiply the number of logs by 5 to get the total number of planks.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie's salary is $5000. Since she earns 1/2 of her brother's salary, her brother's salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. So, their mother's salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, let's add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk.

Let's denote the rate of speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her rate on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that the distance walked on the beach is 2 miles and the time spent walking on the beach is 40 minutes. We can use the formula: distance = rate * time to find the rate of speed on the beach.

2 = x * 40
x = 2 miles per minute

Now that we know the rate of speed on the beach, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk. The distance walked on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and the rate of speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 miles per minute.

Time = distance / rate
Time = 1 / 4 = 0.25 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent walking by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

Total time = 40 + 0.25 = 40.25 minutes

The final answer is: 40.25"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so we multiply 4 by 8:
4 * 8 = 32

Since she has already saved $32, we subtract this from the total amount she wants to save ($60) to find out how much more she needs:
60 - 32 = 28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save $28 at a rate of $4 per week. We can divide $28 by $4:
28 ÷ 4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

28"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

3 trees each had 7 blue birds, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

2 different trees each had 4 blue birds, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

1 final tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds from each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

Let's denote the initial number of marbles as 'x'. 

We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, the equation can be written as: 
x + 24 = 60

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 
x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now that we know Bob initially has 36 marbles, we need to subtract 10 marbles from this number. 
36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles.

26"
"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the information given:

- Donny has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature.
- He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle.
- The water in the bottle is now drinkable, meaning it's at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the amount of water in the bottle becomes 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water. 

The total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. Since the water is now drinkable, the temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up an inequality to represent this situation:

(4 * 33) + (1 * x) ≥ 40

Simplifying the inequality:

132 + x ≥ 40

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 8

So, the second mug must be at least 8 degrees to make the water drinkable after pouring."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Total number of cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs. 
Total cost = 4 * $10.00 = $40.00

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Russell paid. 
Final amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, we divide the final amount by 9 to find the cost of each bagel. 
Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 9 = $4.00

The final answer is $4.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's start by defining the variables:
- Let x be the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate.
- Let y be the number of potatoes needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

From the given information, we have two equations:

1. x = 23 - 5 (Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops)
   x = 18

2. y = 6 - 3 (it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 scoop)
   y = 3

Now, we need to find the number of potatoes Gomer ate. Since we know that 1 scoop is equal to 3 potatoes, we can multiply the number of scoops by 3 to find the total number of potatoes.

Number of potatoes = x * 3
= 18 * 3
= 54

Therefore, Gomer ate 54 potatoes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester will eat in 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester will eat in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester will need:

240 ÷ 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, we can multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2.

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

The number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

He grows 5 trees and each tree gives 6 lemons per year. So, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

Now, to find the total number of lemons he gets in a decade, we multiply 30 by 10:
30 * 10 = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women on the bus initially, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of 1 part: 84 ÷ 14 = 6.

Now, we multiply the value of 1 part by the number of parts representing women (9) to find the initial number of women: 6 * 9 = 54.

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bouquets Faraday sold in 3 days. 

Let's start by finding out how many bouquets he sold. We know that he earned $56 from the bouquet per day, so in 3 days, he earned 3 * $56 = $168 from the bouquets. Since each bouquet costs $8, the number of bouquets he sold is $168 / $8 = 21.

Now, we know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold is 21 * 12 = 252.

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell 252 sunflowers after 3 days.

The final answer is: 252"
"To calculate the initial investment, Adam spends $100 on rocks. 

He buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

He sells 60% of his inventory, which is 20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks.

He earns 12 * 7 = $84 from selling the rocks.

He loses 100 - 84 = $16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of days required, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the project requires all three types of scenes, we need to find the maximum number of days required, which is 9 days for large-sized scenes.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

First, we need to convert the number of eggs from dozens to individual eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12 eggs, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4):

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the daily cost and then multiply it by the number of days in May.

May has 31 days. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, the total daily cost for all 3 fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"

Then, she bought 15 more roses:
6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

= 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability of both tickets being winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets being winners, we multiply the individual probabilities:

0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected.

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 5 = 27

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

2x = 22

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x = 2(11) = 22 seashells.

Now, we know that the total number of seashells is 11 + 22 + 27 = 60.

To divide the seashells equally among the three people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. 
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days in a week.
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of Carl and then the length of his cane.

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is 3."
"To find the total energy demand of 2300 people, we need to multiply the number of people by the energy demand per person.

Energy demand per person = 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand
Energy demand per person = 0.20 * 1 = 0.20
Total energy demand of 2300 people = 0.20 * 2300 = 460

Since each bottle covers 20% of the daily energy demand, we need 100% of the energy demand, which is 460 bottles.

Currently, Hortex produces 4200 bottles. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production:

460 - 4200 = -3740

However, this is not possible, as Hortex cannot produce a negative number of bottles. This means that the initial assumption of 20% of the daily energy demand per person is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If each bottle covers 20% of the daily energy demand, then 1 bottle covers 0.20 of the daily energy demand. To cover 100% of the daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (100% / 0.20 = 5).

Now, we can calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy demand of 2300 people:

Total bottles needed = 5 * 2300 = 11500

Since Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles, we subtract the current production from the required production:

11500 - 4200 = 7300

Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing a bow and the number of babies wearing purple.

Let's assume there are 8 babies (since it's an octuplet).

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing a bow = 1/3 * (number of babies wearing purple) + 1/3 * (number of babies wearing blue)
= 1/3 * 6 + 1/3 * 2
= 2 + 2/3
= 8/3

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 

Probability = (Number of babies wearing purple and a bow) / (Total number of babies wearing a bow)
= (Number of babies wearing purple) / (Total number of babies wearing a bow)
= 6 / (8/3)
= 6 * 3 / 8
= 18/8

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on all days = 5168

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday and Saturday (since we don't have information about Saturday). 
Total reports received on Wednesday and Saturday = Total reports received on all days - Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday - Total reports received on Thursday and Friday
= 5168 - 1907 - 2136
= 5168 - 4043
= 1125

Now, we need to find the number of reports received on Wednesday. Since we don't have information about Saturday, we can't directly find the number of reports received on Wednesday. However, we can find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Wednesday and Saturday.
Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on Wednesday and Saturday - Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday
= 1125 - 1907
= -782

However, the number of reports cannot be negative. This is because we are trying to find the number of reports received on Wednesday. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We can find the total number of reports received on Wednesday and Saturday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received on all days.
Total reports received on Wednesday and Saturday = Total reports received on all days - Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday - Total reports received on Thursday and Friday
= 5168 - 1907 - 2136
= 5168 - 4043
= 1125

Now, we can find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Wednesday and Saturday.
Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on Wednesday and Saturday - Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday
= 1125 - 1907

However, the number of reports cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

We can find the total number of reports received on Wednesday and Thursday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.
Total reports received on Wednesday and Thursday = Total reports received on all days - Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday

Now, we can find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received on Wednesday and Thursday.
Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on Wednesday and Thursday - Total reports received on Thursday and Friday
= 3261 - 2136

The final answer is 1125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Abraham initially has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left. He then sold 1/4 of this remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 30 square meters for 30 * 3 = $90.

To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to add the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person finds and then subtract that from the total number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 0.6 * 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = 3120 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: 2350"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100, which is $20.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the red rope as R, and the length of the yellow rope as Y.

We are given the following information:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: R = 4B
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: B = Y - 7
3. The 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters: R + B + Y = 37

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
4B + B + Y = 37
Combine like terms:
5B + Y = 37

Now, substitute the second equation into the previous equation:
5B + (B + 7) = 37
Combine like terms:
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:
B = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

Let's say Ronnie gave x dollars to his sister. Then, Rissa gave x dollars to her sister as well. 

Initially, Rissa had 15 - x dollars. After giving x dollars to her sister, she was left with 15 - 2x dollars.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. So, we can set up the equation:

15 - 2x = (4/5)(15)

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5:

75 - 10x = 60

Now, we can subtract 75 from both sides:

-10x = -15

Dividing both sides by -10:

x = 1.5

So, Ronnie gave his sister $1.5.

Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's initial money: $5
Ronnie gave his sister: $1.5
Ronnie's remaining money: 5 - 1.5 = $3.5

The final answer is: $3.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's assume the amount of red, white, and purple paint used is x pints each. Since there are equal amounts of these three colors, the total amount of paint used for these three colors is 3x pints.

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is half of the total amount of paint, which is 12 pints. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of paint used:

3x + 6 = 12

Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation gives us:

3x = 6

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 2

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of clouds Alice counted across all five days is 93.

93"
"To find the number of cycles, we need to first find the number of pods in the new box. 

The original box has 100 pods. The new box has 20% more pods, so we need to calculate 20% of 100 pods and add it to 100.

20% of 100 pods = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods
New box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods

Now, we know that the new box has 120 pods and costs the same as the original box ($12). We want to find out how many cycles we can run for $1.

To do this, we need to divide $1 by the cost of the new box ($12) and multiply it by the number of pods in the new box (120).

Number of cycles = (1 / 12) * 120
= 10

So, you can run 10 cycles with the new box for $1."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. 
Since 1000 / 20 = 50, Thomas has 50 $20 bills initially.

Step 2: He loses 10 bills while getting home.
So, he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 $20 bills.

Step 3: He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 $20 bills to pay for the bill. 
Now, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 $20 bills.

Step 4: Thomas triples his money.
Since he has 20 $20 bills, tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 $20 bills.

Step 5: He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.
Since 60 $20 bills are equivalent to 60 * 5 = 300 $5 bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the first half.
Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

Step 2: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Step 3: Calculate the number of goals scored by team A in the second half.
Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores (1/4) * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of goals scored by team A in the match.
Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, so team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of goals scored by team B in the match.
Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, so team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of goals scored in the match.
The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how much chalk is left. 

5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher now uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 2.75 inches.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to find the number of days it takes to use up the remaining 0.55 inches.

0.55 inches / 0.20 = 2.75 days

Since the teacher already used 2.25 inches on Monday, we need to add 1 day to the result.

2.75 days + 1 day = 3.75 days

So, the teacher has 3.75 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk."

"To find the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus got a refund for the returned milk, we need to calculate the total cost of the returned milk.

Cost of 1600 gallons of milk = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total with $27000.

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost of one book by dividing $500 by 100 books.

$500 ÷ 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by the cost of one book.

$27000 ÷ $5 per book = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books to 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

5400 books ÷ 3 schools = 1800 books per school

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, so he had 2 - 1 = 1 apple left.
3. Then, 5 more apples fell out of the tree, so he now had 1 + 5 = 6 apples.
4. He put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he had 6 - 1 = 5 apples left.
5. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out, so he now had 5 + 6 = 11 apples.
6. Finally, he picked up all the remaining apples and went home.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs and subtract the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, so his rate is 20 snowballs per hour.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which they melt, we need to convert 15 minutes to hours. 15 minutes is 0.25 hours.

So, 2 snowballs melt every 0.25 hours. To find the rate, we divide 2 by 0.25, which is 8 snowballs per hour.

Now, we subtract the rate at which they melt from the rate at which Jay builds snowballs: 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by 12, which is 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to determine how old he was when Digimon was released. Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release is x. 
John's age at the time of Digimon's release would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, and we also know that the time that has passed since Digimon's release is the same for both John and Jim. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
28 = 2x + x

Combine like terms: 
28 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 28 / 3
x = 9.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 
x = 9

This means Jim was 9 years old when Digimon was released. 

To find Jim's current age, we add the years that have passed since Digimon's release to his age at the time of release: 
Jim's current age = 9 + 20
Jim's current age = 29

The final answer is 29."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

2. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

3. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

4. On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59.

5. We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

6. Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 59 = 19.

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

Weekly earnings = 45 hours/week * $1.5/hour
Weekly earnings = $67.50/week

Since Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance, we need to add this to her weekly earnings.
Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings + Attendance bonus
Total weekly earnings = $67.50/week + $10/week
Total weekly earnings = $77.50/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we multiply her total weekly earnings by 4.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we calculate 50% of the cost of the scotch and add it to the cost of the scotch:
50% of $60 = 0.5 * $60 = $30
$60 + $30 = $90 per bottle

Now, we multiply the cost per bottle of cognac by the number of bottles:
$90 * 20 = $1800

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we find the height of the house: 
   Mattison's height is 60 inches, and the house is 7 times as high as he is, so the house's height is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

2. Then, we find the height of the first floor: 
   The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, so the first floor's height is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

3. Now, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor:

4. Since the question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house:
   420 - 240 = 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

Remaining shells = 700 - 280 = 420

Next, we need to find 60% of the remaining shells, which is the number of shells team The finders found.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we need to find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.

Shells found by team Gogetters = 420 - 252 = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the total miles walked by all dogs, we need to add the miles walked by the first three dogs. 

1 (first dog) + 4 (second dog) + 3 (third dog) = 8 miles

Since there are 4 dogs in total, we divide the total miles by 4 to find the average miles per dog. 

8 miles / 4 dogs = 2 miles per dog

However, the problem states that the average miles per dog is 3 miles. To find the total miles needed for all dogs, we multiply the average miles per dog by the total number of dogs.

3 miles per dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles

Now, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all dogs to find the miles needed for the last dog.

12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles

The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day."
"To find out how much John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of his house's value.

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas.

Total weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram.

Total earnings = Total weight * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg
Total earnings = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
= (11 * 72) / 8
= 792 / 8
= 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= 99 - 72
= 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount removed at each setting and add them together.

Low setting: 1 liter per day for 3 days = 1 * 3 = 3 liters
Medium setting: 2 times the low setting, so 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day for 3 days = 2 * 3 = 6 liters
High setting: 2 times the medium setting, so 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day for 5 days = 4 * 5 = 20 liters

Now, let's add the total amount of water removed:
3 (low) + 6 (medium) + 20 (high) = 29 liters

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we need to first find the total number of balloons they started with. 

They have 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack. 
10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons

Since 12 balloons are left, we subtract 12 from the total number of balloons to find out how many were thrown.
300 - 12 = 288

The answer is 288."
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to multiply 14 mL by 3.

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

Now, we need to add the amount of the first medicine (14 mL) to the amount of the second medicine (42 mL) for one dose.

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Since Saanvi needs to prepare 8 doses, we multiply the total amount of one dose (56 mL) by 8.

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

The final answer is 448."
"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has 2 classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 1/8 * 120 = 15
John's school capacity = 2 * 15 = 30

Now, we need to add the capacity of Ali's school and John's school to find the combined capacity.
Combined capacity = Ali's school capacity + John's school capacity
= 120 + 30
= 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To calculate the total amount Stephen needs to pay, we first need to find the interest he owes. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * $300 = $6.

The total amount Stephen needs to pay is the initial $300 plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

To find the amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first find out how many diapers are changed in total per day. 

There are 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will change the other half. Half of 10 is 10 / 2 = 5.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to multiply the length, width, and height of the jar.

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the total volume by 0.8 to get the actual volume of the jelly beans.

Actual volume of jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Actual volume of jelly beans = 675 cubic inches

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the actual volume of the jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = 675 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 202.5

However, since we can't have a fraction of a jelly bean, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

Number of red jelly beans = 202

To find how far off Tim's guess was, we subtract the actual number of red jelly beans from the true number of red jelly beans.

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Tim's guess
Difference = 900 - 202
Difference = 698

The final answer is: 698"
"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to follow the steps:

1. The bus had 20 people initially.
2. 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, so the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30.
   So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station.
   The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. 
   The number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits, we need to calculate the cost of the visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits 3 times a year, the total cost for the first 5 years is:
5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = 5 * 3 * 2 = $30

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is:
$2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5
The total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 years * 3 visits/year * $5/visit = 3 * 3 * 5 = $45

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$30 + $45 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 3 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, making a total of 3 * 10 = 30 students. Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we can form 30 / 8 = 3.75 groups. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left. 

The 3 full groups will take 3 * 45 minutes = 135 minutes. The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group to finish. 

So, the total time required is 135 minutes for the 3 full groups and 45 minutes for the remaining 6 students. 

Total time = 135 + 45 = 180 minutes.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames separately.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each is 4 x $20 = $80.
The cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each is 2 x $10 = $20.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

John has to pay Ali $100."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios. Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces must be equal to 40. We can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to first find out how many pounds of meat he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds of meat by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window.

Number of windows: 5
Width of each window: 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of cupcakes and brownies. Let C be the number of cupcakes and B be the number of brownies.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be represented as:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that each person gets two treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up the equation:

C + B = 10

Now we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost, first, we need to find the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The original cost of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. So, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, let's add the cost of nail art for both hands. There are 10 nails (5 fingers on each hand), and each nail art costs $3. So, the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year will send 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's represent the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can represent Shelley's paintings as x + 8.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so we can represent Samantha's paintings as (x + 8) - 12.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:
x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

Price in December: $40 + $32 = $72

Price decrease in January: 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
Price in January: $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and then add them together.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate:
4 lessons * $80 per lesson = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. 
25% of $80 is $20, so his reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per lesson.
2 lessons * $60 per lesson = $120

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So Eve originally had 80 pomelos.

Now, we can find out how many pomelos Eve gave away by subtracting the number of pomelos she had left from the original amount:

Eve gave away 60 pomelos."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Walter bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them. 
   2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. 
   So, the remaining apples are 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

2. Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 
   25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples. 
   So, the remaining apples after giving to his sister are 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

3. Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each.

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Since he traveled for 3 days, we need to convert the days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100

"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Now, we need to find the total available time for the custodian to work in 5 days. Since they work 8 hours a day, the total available time is:
5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total available time and multiply by 100:

The custodian spends 50% of their available time cleaning classrooms on average."
"To find the total number of books each shelf can hold, we need to determine the capacity of each shelf.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since the middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, we know the capacity of each shelf: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

To find the total capacity of all shelves, we add the capacities together: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find the number of bookcases needed: 110 / 45 = 2.44.

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. 
So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick:
$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost per stick to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents.

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to get right in total to pass the 6th grade.

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to get right as follows:

70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77

Since she already got 60% of the first test correct, we need to subtract that from the total number of questions she needs to get right:

77 - 60% of 70 = 77 - 0.6 * 70 = 77 - 42 = 35

Now, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test. Since the second test has 40 questions, we can set up the equation:

x = 40 - (questions she already got right on the first test)

We know that she got 60% of the first test correct, so we can calculate the number of questions she got right on the first test as follows:

60% of 70 = 0.6 * 70 = 42

Now we can plug this value into the equation:

x = 40 - 42
x = -2

However, this is not possible, as the number of questions cannot be negative. This means that Audrey did not get 60% of the first test correct, or she got more than 100% of the first test correct. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If Audrey got 60% of the first test correct, she got 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions correct. Since she needs to get 77 questions correct in total, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent it as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting x into the equation 5x - 4:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He picked up a bead that wasn't a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble.
5. Now he has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars.
Since 1 out of every 2 customers buys a car, we need 2 customers to sell 1 car. 
So, to sell 15 cars, we need 15 x 2 = 30 customers.

Step 2: Calculate the number of customers needed to get 30 customers.
Since 1 out of every 25 telephone calls results in a customer coming into the dealership, we need 25 customers to get 1 customer. 
So, to get 30 customers, we need 30 x 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"To find the total number of flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights for each room and then add them together. Since there are 8 rooms and 2 flashlights per room, the total number of flashlights is 8 * 2 = 16.

To find the total number of candles, we need to calculate the number of small candles and medium candles separately. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

Now, we can find the total number of candles and flashlights by adding them together: 16 flashlights + 36 candles = 52.

The final answer is 52."
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. 

There are 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110 chips.

"To calculate the total time, we need to break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time taken for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time taken to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"To find the total number of items, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is 20 * 2 = 40.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first find out how many minutes he spends on calls in a day. 

Since he spends 6 hours a day at work, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 6 hours by 60 minutes to get 360 minutes per day.

Now, we divide the total minutes per day (360) by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls per day (24) by 5 to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the time difference, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

Time for old varnish to dry on 6 paintings: 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes
Time for new varnish to dry on 6 paintings: 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Time difference: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

The new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water:
4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

Next, let's calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water:
8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, let's calculate the amount of water for the remaining plants. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining plants are 20 - 12 = 8 plants.

Since these plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we can calculate the amount as follows:
8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the total amount of water needed:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes to hop on land and the time it takes to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Half of 200 yards is 100 yards. 

Time = Distance / Speed

For the land part: 
Time = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

For the water part:
Time = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Since these two parts are happening simultaneously, we add the times together to get the total time:
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of boxes Bob needs, we need to divide the total number of popsicle sticks he needs (56) by the number of sticks per box (8).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since Bob needs 7 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since there are 4 additional phones, and each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

The total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $160 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in June, we need to multiply the number of dozen doughnuts he makes per day by the number of days in June. 

June has 30 days. 
10 dozen doughnuts per day * 30 days = 300 doughnuts per day

Since Derrick sells each doughnut for $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:
300 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $600

Derrick makes $600 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped in each time period.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, 3 times the amount of the first 30 seconds popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to 4 times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels popped from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add the kernels that popped from the residual heat to the total:
200 + 10 = 210 kernels

"To find the total number of lemons needed, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for 4 gallons of lemonade and then multiply it by 2 for the extra gallon.

First, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for 1 gallon of lemonade. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, and 1 gallon is equal to 4 cups, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:

6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons / 4 cups = 1.5 lemons per cup

Now, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 4 gallons:

1.5 lemons per cup * 4 cups per gallon = 6 lemons per gallon

Since Tim needs to make 5 gallons of lemonade (4 gallons for the party and 1 extra gallon), we multiply the number of lemons per gallon by 5:

6 lemons per gallon * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to multiply the number of lemons by 2:

30 lemons * 2 = 60 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 60 lemons in total.

"To find the distance Elvis traveled west, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled west: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours
Distance = 90 miles

To find the distance Elvis traveled east, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled east: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours
Distance = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. 
The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west: 
Net Distance = Distance East - Distance West
Net Distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net Distance = 54 miles

"To calculate the depreciation, we need to calculate the value of the boat after each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

"To calculate the total amount Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
- Original price of each T-shirt: $8
- Buy one get one 50% off deal
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so he pays full price for 1 and gets 50% off the other
- Price of the first T-shirt: $8
- Price of the second T-shirt: $8 * 0.5 = $4
- Total cost of T-shirts: $8 + $4 = $12

For the shoes:
- Original price of the shoes: $40
- 40% off the original price
- Discount amount: $40 * 0.4 = $16
- Price of the shoes after discount: $40 - $16 = $24

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:
- Total cost: $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings first. 

Ryan earns $6 per week and he did his chores for 3 weeks, so his earnings are:
6 * 3 = 18

Now, he spent $1.25 on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. The total cost of ice cream cones is:
1.25 * 4 = 5

Now, subtract the cost of ice cream cones from his earnings:
18 - 5 = 13

Now, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets that cost $6.50 each. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket:
13 / 6.5 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add the costs of the items purchased by Ellen and Lani.

Ellen's purchases: 
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total spent by Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: 2 * $100 = $200
Total spent by Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both: $105 + $230 = $335

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the total cost of making 1 jar of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of each ingredient and add them together.

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of 1 jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, to find the profit per jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price:
Profit per jar: $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
Total profit: $6 * 10 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

- 32 quarters = 32 * $0.25 = $8.00
- 95 dimes = 95 * $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6.00
- 750 pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8.00 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6.00 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how many days Josh is open in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he is open in a week and then multiply it by 2.

Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday). 
In 2 weeks, he is open 5 * 2 = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, the total number of cars he services in 2 weeks is 3 * 10 = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks will be 30 * 4 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the situation step by step:

Initially, Randy has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He eats:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie for a snack
- 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch
- 2 sugar cookies for his friends

After eating, he has:
- 9 - 1 - 2 - 2 = 4 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 4 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 sugar cookies

After baking, he has:
- 4 + 4 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

So, Randy now has 8 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection.

Half of 12 is 6. 

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each): 6 * 5 = 30

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each): 6 * 7 = 42

Now, we add the earnings from both halves: 30 + 42 = 72

Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the buyer's offer."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many holes Nate needs to fill.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled per day is:
9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes. We can divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to calculate 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School.

3/4 of 4000 is (3/4) * 4000 = 3000.

So, Butler High School enrolls 3000 students on average.

To find the difference in enrollment between the two schools, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Subtracting the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:
7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, let's solve for B: 
8 + B + 16 = 29
B + 24 = 29
B = 29 - 24
B = 5

So, Igor gathered 5 beakers.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of screws needed, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then multiply that by the number of screws per leg.

Number of tables: 4
Number of legs per table: 4
Number of screws per leg: 2

Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2 = 32

James has 40 screws. To find the number of screws left over, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

40 - 32 = 8

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 2 * 10 = 20

Total number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30

30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a proportion based on the information given. Let's denote the time it took Aaron to run his part of the race as 'x' minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it took Vanessa to run her part of the race would be 2x minutes.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we also know that Aaron ran half the distance that Vanessa did. So, the distance Aaron ran is 4 / 2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can set up the following proportion:

x / 2 = 16 / 2x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 16 * 2
2x = 32
x = 32 / 2
x = 16

Now that we know x, we can find the time it took Vanessa to run her part of the race:

Time taken by Vanessa = 2x
Time taken by Vanessa = 2 * 16
Time taken by Vanessa = 32 minutes

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line required

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required.

600 feet of line required - 6 feet of line already available = 594 feet of line needed

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by 2 (since they are open 2 days a week).

Daily revenue:
- 6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals
- 12 meals * $5 per meal = $60
- 1 bottle of wine * $5 = $5
- Total daily revenue = $60 + $5 = $65

Weekly revenue:
- Daily revenue * 2 (since they are open 2 days a week) = $65 * 2 = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the total selling price.

Total cost of watermelons = $80
Profit percentage = 25%

First, we find the total selling price:
Total selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Total selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Total selling price = $80 + $20
Total selling price = $100

Now, we find the selling price of each watermelon:
Number of watermelons = 50
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we can find James' current age by subtracting 3 from 12. 
James' current age = 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know that John had a son James when he was 19. To find John's current age, we need to add the number of years that have passed since James was born to John's age at the time of James' birth. 
Since James is 9 years old now, the number of years that have passed since James was born is 9. 
John's current age = 19 + 9 = 28 years.

Now, we know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. To find the youngest son's current age, we need to subtract the number of years that have passed since the youngest son was born from John's current age. 
The number of years that have passed since the youngest son was born is 28 - 32 = -4 years. However, since we can't have negative years, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's rephrase it: John's youngest son was born when John was 32, and we want to find the youngest son's age in 3 years. 
The number of years that have passed since the youngest son was born is 3. 
Youngest son's current age = 32 + 3 = 35 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son's age will be 35 + 3 = 38 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person peels per minute and then calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled after an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1 orange / 3 minutes = 1/3 orange per minute.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her peeling rate is 1 orange / 4 minutes = 1/4 orange per minute.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of oranges each person peels in an hour:

Ana peels (1/3) * 60 = 20 oranges
Jane peels (1/4) * 60 = 15 oranges

Now, we can find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

20 - 15 = 5

So, Ana will peel 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the cost of the radiator at the junk shop, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320
$400 - $320 = $80

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the labor for the mechanic. 
3 hours * $50 per hour = $150

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.
$80 + $150 = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use the fact that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Let's say the number of chickens is x and the number of cows is y.

We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for x by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2x + 4y = 70
2x + 2y = 40 (multiplied the first equation by 2)
-------------------
2y = 30

Now, divide both sides by 2:

y = 15

Now that we know y, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find x:

x + 15 = 20
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens and 15 cows.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (including Henry and his 3 friends, which is 4). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is 14."
