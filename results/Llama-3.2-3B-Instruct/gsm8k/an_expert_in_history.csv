"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs per sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints per week.

James runs 3 sprints per week, and each sprint is 60 meters. 

Total meters per sprint = 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Total meters per week = 180 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far and subtract that from the total amount of feed she needs for the entire day.

She gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed she has given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed she needs for the entire day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

To find out how much feed she needs for the final meal, we subtract the amount she has already given from the total amount she needs: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass, then add them together.

The first glass costs $5.
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost for the first 15 glasses (since the second glass is 60% of the price of the first glass) and the 16th glass.

The cost of the first 15 glasses is 15 * $5 = $75.
The cost of the 16th glass is $3.

The total cost is $75 + $3 = $78.

The final answer is: $78"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle by adding the number of sheep in each city: 
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB.
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 120 GB is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to restart the download:
60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Next, Carla has to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Now, let's add the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file and the time it takes to restart the download:
80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the 200 GB file.

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to break it down into three parts.

1. The first part: John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 60 * 3
   Distance = 180 miles

2. The second part: John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move.
   Distance = 0 miles

3. The third part: John drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 30 * 0.5
   Distance = 15 miles

4. The fourth part: John drives for 3.5 hours at 80 mph.
   Distance = Speed * Time
   Distance = 80 * 3.5
   Distance = 280 miles

Now, we add up the distances from each part to find the total distance John traveled.
Total Distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 280
Total Distance = 455 miles

John is 455 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

Final Answer: 455"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the point where the net profit is greater than $0. To do this, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

However, this calculation only accounts for the initial cost and does not take into account the fact that the tree will start producing lemons after the first year. 

So, we need to subtract 1 from the result to get the correct number of years:

12 years - 1 year = 11 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos 11 years for the lemon tree to start earning money.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - 12 - x + 2 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 30

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit from the electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling at the same time, they will cover the same distance.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward.

So, the total distance covered by each train is:
- Westward: 80 miles
- Northward: 150 miles
- Total distance covered by each train: 80 + 150 = 230 miles

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary as a teacher: 
- 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week
- 50 weeks/year * $700/week = $35,000/year

Her annual salary as a coach: 
- 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week
- 50 weeks/year * $450/week = $22,500/year

Total annual salary:

"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

Now, we multiply the number of eggs she eats per week by 4 to find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert 84 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to maintain her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour. 

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Speed required = Distance / Time
Speed required = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed required = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

Initially, the orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

When 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water lost is 1 liter. So, the remaining amount of water is 49/3 - 1 = 48/3 = 16 liters.

The total amount of liquid remaining is 24 liters, so the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 16 liters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age: 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold.

His first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.
His next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.
His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

Now, let's add up the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract that from the total distance of the trip.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. 

Henry stopped after 20 miles, so the distance he traveled before his second stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance between his first and second stops is 15 miles.

Therefore, Henry traveled 15 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the second pair of heels costs 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. This can be written as:

33 + 66 = B - 5

Combine the costs of the heels:
99 = B - 5

Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate B:
99 + 5 = B
104 = B

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3 (the number of guesses).

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

Final answer: $75.00"
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left, we can find the amount he spent on video games and Lego sets by subtracting the amount he had left from the total amount he got: $195 - $160 = $35.

Now, we know that he spent $35 on video games and Lego sets. We also know that he spent $160 on video games. To find out how much he spent on Lego sets, we subtract the cost of video games from the total amount he spent: $35 - $160 is incorrect, we need to subtract the cost of video games from the total amount he got: $195 - $160 = $35. Since he spent $35 on both video games and Lego sets, we can find the number of Lego sets he sold by dividing the amount he spent on Lego sets by the price of each set: $35 / $15 = 2.33. Since we can't sell a fraction of a Lego set, we round down to 2 sets.

However, we know John had 13 Lego sets initially, and he sold 2 sets. To find out how many Lego sets he still has, we subtract the number of sets he sold from the initial number of sets: 13 - 2 = 11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find John's speed, we need to first calculate the total number of hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Since he runs 6 hours in 3 days, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total hours by the number of days: 6 hours / 3 days = 2 hours per day.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles in 2 hours. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 2 hours = 30 miles per hour.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels by running and walking in six hours. 

Distance traveled by running = speed * time = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance traveled by walking = speed * time = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled in six hours = 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. So, the remaining calories available for consumption are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have: 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 servings * 5 grams per serving = 4 grams.

The final answer is 4."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue: Charlie sells 20 candles at $2.00 each, so the total revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

Total cost: Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, so for 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax and the wicks. The cost of the beeswax and the wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is 20 x $10.00 = $200.00.

Net profit: To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00.

Since the net profit is negative, Charlie is actually losing money."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes an average of 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used and the ones she had left.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is the sum of the ones she used and the ones she had left: 220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243.

Now, we subtract the initial number of Post-it notes from the total number to find the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased: 243 (total) - 80 (initial) = 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

200 / 40 = 5 blue ties

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

10 red ties * $60 per tie = $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and red ties:

$200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800

The final answer is: 800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to calculate the total number of units in the building and then find 3/4 of that number.

Total number of units in the building = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total number of units in the building = 15 * 8
Total number of units in the building = 120

Now, we need to find 3/4 of the total number of units.
3/4 of the total number of units = (3/4) * 120
3/4 of the total number of units = 90

Since the total number of units in the building is 120, the number of unoccupied units is:
Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units - Number of occupied units
Number of unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Number of unoccupied units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds from the toys.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, $480 (Friday) is greater than $520 (Thursday). 

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since we are looking for the amount of revenue earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens.

"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags he can fill:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14):

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees are $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 2 (sour) = 3 oranges

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the total number of unripe and bad/sour oranges from the total number of oranges: 
25 - 5 (unripe) - 3 (bad/sour) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she receives 5% of the initial pension value. The initial pension value is $50,000. 

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, for the remaining 10 years, Marcy's annual pension will be $2,500.

To find the total annual pension after 30 years, we add the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the remaining 10 years.

Total annual pension = $50,000 (for the first 20 years) + $2,500 (for the remaining 10 years) = $52,500.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used to fill it up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she has left (3 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 3 gallons = approximately 33.33 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive approximately 33.33 miles per gallon.

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the remaining days in the year.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The remaining days in the year are 365 - 180 = 185 days. After the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we need to calculate the cost of buying 3 packages of 3 flowers each and then add the cost of 3 additional flowers.
Cost of 3 packages of 3 flowers = 3 * $2.50 = $7.50
Cost of 3 additional flowers = 3 * $1 = $3
Total cost = $7.50 + $3 = $10.50

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won would be 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22. So, the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683
Salary after 10 years = $1414.7683 + $141.47683 = $1556.24513

"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults, so the total amount for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

A child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. There are 5 children, so the total amount for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children together: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets the three have: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children.

We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age can be calculated by subtracting 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs it in 38 seconds, we can set up an equation to find Gerald's original time. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation as: 
x + 2 = 38

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
x = 38 - 2
x = 36

So, Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his diet change. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 seconds is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds.

Now, we can add this to his original time to find his new time:
36 + 3.6 = 39.6

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds with his improved diet.

39.6"
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry slept and the hours James slept. 

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume when cooking, the 32 ounces of sauce she made came from 64 ounces of tomatoes (32 * 2 = 64).

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes (64) by 16 to find out how many cans she used, and then multiply that by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

64 / 16 = 4 cans
4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20 (the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes).

We also know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now we can set up an equation:

x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:

x = 5

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she already has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She received 18 new potted plants yesterday, so the total number of potted plants she now has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. 

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

Therefore, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 

Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3, since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir.

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 15

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1.5 hours is equal to 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. To do this, we divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes. 90 / 30 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he bakes 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each roll and then add them together.

For Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 roll-ups * 24 rolls = 48 roll-ups
For Marcell's roll-ups: 3 roll-ups * 14 rolls = 42 roll-ups

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups eaten by each person.

Average number of roll-ups eaten: 90 / 2 = 45

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away and she rows 20 feet at a time, we can divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round down to 3 sets.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rowed 3 sets of 20 feet, she would have taken on 2 liters * 3 sets = 6 liters of water.

The time it took her to row 3 sets of 20 feet is 3 sets * 16 seconds per set = 48 seconds. However, this is not the total time it took her to reach the shore. We know the shore is 64 seconds away, and she took 48 seconds to row 3 sets of 20 feet. So, the remaining time is 64 - 48 = 16 seconds. Since she took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the distance she covered in the remaining 16 seconds. 

16 seconds / 16 seconds per 20 feet = 1 set of 20 feet. 

Since she took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and she covered 1 set of 20 feet, she would have taken on 2 liters * 1 set = 2 liters of water.

So, the total amount of water the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore is 6 liters + 2 liters = 8 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so we can write an equation: 
6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can write an equation:
B = 50D

Substituting the value of B we found earlier, we get:
300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

The total cost of all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of each board is 1.5 times the original price. 
The original price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10, so the selling price is $10 * 1.5 = $15.
The original price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16, so the selling price is $16 * 1.5 = $24.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $270 - $180 = $90.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added (20) by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then calculate their current salaries.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)

To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can divide both sides by 1.3:
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary:
Adrien's current salary = Adrien's salary four years ago + 40% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + 0.4($40,000)
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's current salary = $56,000

Now, we can calculate their total salary four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $30,769
Total salary = $86,769

The final answer is: $86,769"

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many letters Jennie put stamps on. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
One-third of the letters needing stamps = 60 / 3 = 20

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters.

Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the number of letters she put stamps on from the current number of letters in the pile.

Number of letters in the pile when Jennie began = Number of letters in the pile now - Number of letters she put stamps on

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband gave her 5 spoons, so now she has x + 5 spoons.

She used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she has x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons left.

We know that she had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total time spent on patients per day. 

500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes per day

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours per day

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, so the total revenue from patients is:
200 hours * $200 per hour = $40,000 per day

The hospital charges the doctors $150 per hour, so the total cost of paying the doctors is:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000 per day

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
$40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000 per day

The hospital makes $10,000 per day from these visits."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
   A third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20. 
   So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   10 elves quit, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

"To find the total expenditure, we need to calculate the expenditure for May and June separately and then add them together.

Expenditure in May: $500
Expenditure in June: $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: 940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 6 * 2 = 24 tickets.

In total, they used 12 + 24 + 24 = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday.

41 - 28 = 13 miles.

Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

Total cost per year: $60 * 12 = $720

Tom pays $720 in a year."
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to first find the total number of Scottish unicorns. 

Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, and there are 27 unicorns in total, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows:

27 / 3 = 9

So, there are 9 Scottish unicorns.

Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

9 * 2/3 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

"To calculate the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Now, we add the questions completed in both tests: 
40 questions + 30 questions = 70 questions

Since the total number of questions in the first test was 75, we subtract the questions completed from the total to find the questions left incomplete: 
75 questions - 70 questions = 5 questions

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first calculate four times the number of blue gumballs. 

Four times the number of blue gumballs is 4 * 12 = 48.

Since there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, we add 22 to 48. 

48 + 22 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into the equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To calculate the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to first calculate the number of hours he would work in a week.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would play for 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

Since he earns $10 an hour, in 14 hours he would earn 14 * 10 = $140.

So, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in one week."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first find the total cost of the food items and the non-food items separately.

The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
10% of 10 dollars is 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items:
10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the food items and the non-food items with tax:
5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left initially return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.

So, the total number of bees that have returned so far is 30 (initially returned) + 15 (in the next 6 hours) = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left fly from the hive and leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before that hadn't already returned. Since 45 bees had returned, 30 - 45 = 15 bees that left initially hadn't returned.

In the last 6 hours, these 15 bees return to the hive.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 15.

Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries.
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Now, to find the initial number of fries in the pack, we need to add the fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, the pigeons, the raccoon, and the ants to the remaining fries: 48 (eaten) + 5 (remaining) = 53 fries.

However, we need to account for the fries eaten by the seagull, which is 7 fries. So, the initial number of fries in the pack is 53 + 7 = 60 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. 
She does this 34 times, so she covers 100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round. 
34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance:

"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others. 

Since one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can set up an equation. 

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D. We know that D = 3A and R = 4.

We also know that the cost of one red car is $4, so R = 4. 

Now, we can find the cost of an action figure: 
D = 3A
4 = 3A
A = 4/3

Now that we know the cost of an action figure, we can find the cost of the doll:
D = 3A
D = 3 * (4/3)
D = 4

Now, we have the costs of all the toys:
- Red car: $4
- Action figure: $4/3
- Doll: $4

To find the total cost of all the toys, we add their costs:
Total cost = 5 * R + 3 * A + D
Total cost = 5 * 4 + 3 * (4/3) + 4
Total cost = 20 + 4 + 4
Total cost = 28

Total cost of accessories: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9

Number of babysitting jobs = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2 * 8 = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2.

Ethel has $8. Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 * 8 = 16.

Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has, so we add $2 to 16. 16 + 2 = 18.

Jimmy has $18.

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs of each type of creature and add them together.

Spiders have 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so they have 80 * 8 = 640 legs.
Insects have 90 insects with 6 legs each, so they have 90 * 6 = 540 legs.
Rare mutant invertebrates have 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Now, let's add the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and Sally Thirty-two (8).

To find the total age of the four birds, we add their ages together: 8 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 51.

"To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to first find out how much Jessica wants to pay for each debt. 

For her student loans, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $300. 
50% of $300 is $150, so she wants to pay $300 + $150 = $450 per month.

For her credit card, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $200. 
50% of $200 is $100, so she wants to pay $200 + $100 = $300 per month.

For her mortgage, she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, which is $500. 
50% of $500 is $250, so she wants to pay $500 + $250 = $750 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly payments: $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500 per month.

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000 per year.

The final answer is: $18,000."
"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and cutting each potato separately and then add them together.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for peeling and cutting by 60.

Time to peel 60 potatoes: 1.5 minutes * 60 = 90 minutes
Time to cut 60 potatoes: 5 seconds * 60 = 300 seconds

Converting 300 seconds to minutes: 300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes

Now, we add the time for peeling and cutting together: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue must be $25 + $25 = $50.

Now, let's calculate their total cost per gallon. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since their total revenue is $50 and the total cost per gallon is $5, they must have made 50 / 5 = 10 gallons.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, and they made 10 gallons. So, the total cost of lemons is 10 * $3 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to find the total number of Chinese participants. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese participants. Since there are 240 participants in total, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants. 

Number of girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of boys
= 160 - 60

The final amount Zaid will have is 1300."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crabs each person has.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 
Bo has 40 crabs, Monic has 36 crabs, and Rani has 46 crabs. 
The total number of crabs is 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks.

To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years.
   Since Mark was 5 years older than that, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.
3. Since Mark is now 2 years older than Jean, we can find Jean's age by subtracting 2 from Mark's current age.
   Mark's current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.
   Jean's age is 22 - 2 = 20 years.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event (rolling a number less than or equal to 3) on the first roll, which is 3/6.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and then rolling an even number is (3/6) * (1/2) = 3/12 = 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 and then rolling an even number is (3/6) * (1/2) = 3/12 = 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and then rolling an even number is 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 and then rolling an even number is 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 or rolling two even numbers in a row is 1 - (probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 and rolling an even number) = 1 - (1/4 + 1/4) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4.

The difference in probability is (1/2) - (1/4) = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25%"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first find out how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's apples as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples to find the total number of apples picked:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom is 30.

"To find the total number of straw pieces used for the rats, we need to subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used. 

First, let's calculate the straw used for the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces per hamster = 50 pieces of straw.

Next, let's calculate the straw used for the rabbits: 20 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the remaining straw by 6 to find the number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the number of rats by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's calculate the total cost of transportation:
Total cost of transportation = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost of transportation = 13 * $2
Total cost of transportation = $26

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
Total cost = Total cost of bags + Total cost of transportation
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, let's calculate the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total revenue - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

However, this is the total number of bags bought, not sold. To find the number of bags sold, we need to subtract the number of bags bought from the number of bags sold. But we know that the number of bags bought is equal to the number of bags sold, since the trader bought and sold the same bags. 

So, the number of bags sold is 13."

Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom plants and chops down each year, and then subtract the total number of trees that die after 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so after 10 years, he will have planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

He chops down 2 trees per year, so after 10 years, he will have chopped down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

Initially, Tom had 50 trees. After planting 100 trees, he now has 50 + 100 = 150 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.3: 150 * 0.3 = 45.

So, 45 trees die, leaving Tom with 150 - 45 = 105 trees.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his earnings before the award and then add the award amount.

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award. Since he makes $2000 per week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings before the award would be:

$2000 per week * 52 weeks per year = $104,000 per year

Now, let's add the award amount of $5000 to his total earnings:

$104,000 + $5000 = $105,000

Additionally, he received a 5% raise in salary. To calculate the raise amount, we multiply his original salary by the raise percentage:

$2000 * 0.05 = $100

Now, we add the raise amount to his original salary:

$2000 + $100 = $2100

Since the raise is applied to his new salary, we need to calculate his new salary:

$2100 per week * 52 weeks per year = $109,200 per year

Now, let's add the award amount to his new salary:

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

To get an average of 93, the total score of the six tests should be 93 * 6 = 558.

Since the total score of the first five tests is 438, the score of the sixth test should be 558 - 438 = 120.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test.

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the kilometers he rode in two different periods.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. 
5 times a week * 4 weeks = 20 times
20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the total number of cakes she bought on each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

The final answer is: 76"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   The cost of each cup is $16800 / 240 = $70.

The total cost of buying each cup is $70."
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $40, we can divide $40 by $5, which is 8 sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. Since she earns $4 per session, we can divide $40 by $4, which is 10 sessions.

Since 8 babysitting sessions would not be enough to cover the total amount, we need to find the least common multiple of 8 and 10. The least common multiple of 8 and 10 is 40.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times to earn $40.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the number of customers on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the small pool initially had x gallons of water. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool initially had 2x gallons of water.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons of water and lost 16 gallons, it now has 2x - 16 gallons. We know that this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons of water and lost 16 gallons, so it now has x - 16 gallons. We are told that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, so we can set up another equation:

4y = x - 16

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for x from the second equation into the first equation:

2(4y + 16) - 16 = 4y

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

8y + 32 - 16 = 4y

Combine like terms:

8y + 16 = 4y

Subtract 4y from both sides:

4y + 16 = 0

Subtract 16 from both sides:

4y = -16

Divide both sides by 4:

y = -4

Since the amount of water in the small pool cannot be negative, this solution is not valid. However, we can try to find another solution.

Let's re-examine the equations:

2x - 16 = 4y

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have been mentioned so far: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums: 
90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total:
90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140 flowers.

The total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year, which is a third of $15,000.

$15,000 / 3 = $5,000

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is the sum of the amounts spent in the first and second years.

$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

The company spent $20,000 on advertising for the two years."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then add them together.

Carlos rented a canoe for 3 hours at $30 an hour, so his total cost is 3 x $30 = $90.

Benji rented a banana boat raft for 5 hours at $18 an hour, so his total cost is 5 x $18 = $90.

Now, we add their costs together: $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180.

The total cost for their rentals is $180."
"To find the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the days for each leg of the trip.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days.

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Then, he loses 8 water type cards. 
New total cards = 90 - 8 = 82

He buys 14 grass type cards. 
New total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
New water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To find the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The base burrito is $6.50.
Extra meat is $2.00.
Extra cheese is $1.00.
Avocado is $1.00.
2 sauces are $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The upgrade is $3.00.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50
$8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50
$9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50
$10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can complete per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can complete 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can complete half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. 

So, together they can complete 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, we need to divide 360 by 6 to find the total minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 / 60 = 1 hour

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first visited. 

30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36 watermelons. So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest.

Now, there are 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 is 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons.

So, 63 watermelons were harvested. 

The number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested is 84 - 63 = 21.

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to know that there are half as many bugs as ants. Since there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to add the number of bugs and ants together:

Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
Total number of insects = 25 + 50
Total number of insects = 75

The total number of insects in the garden is 75.

"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to first determine how many penguins left sunbathing after the first two groups leave.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jump in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

So, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins leave the sunbathing area.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 days in a week to get 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what he eats, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes Steve needs in total per week. Since he eats 42 tomatoes and his girlfriend eats 21, the total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 + 21 = 63.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week (63) by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week (3) to get the number of vines needed: 63 / 3 = 21.

"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza. 

Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices needed as follows:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Now, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens.

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has and then compare it to John's and James' candies.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has. 

John has 54 candies, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, we can compare John's and James' candies. John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies. 

The difference between John's and James' candies is 54 - 33 = 21.

"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to add the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read 2 + 2 = 4 books in total.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read 1 + 1 = 2 books in total.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and receives.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

In total, Mike writes 6 (sent) + 6 (received) = 12 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 12 * 5 = 60 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, he writes 60 pages per week in 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call would be:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used would be:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left for the month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for 'x', we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:

"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step:

1. The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total.
2. Half of the balls are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.
3. Half of the golf balls are blue, so the number of blue golf balls is 8 / 2 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we need to multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom. 

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house = 6 bedrooms
6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

There are also 4 additional windows in each house, so we need to multiply this by the number of houses.

4 windows per house * 2 houses = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows.

12 bedroom windows + 8 additional windows = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

The mother pays $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2. 
So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. The solo song has 54 lines. This is the number of lines Sean has to memorize for the song.

2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. So, the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines.

3. Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

4. The second scene has six more lines than the song. So, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.

5. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize in the second scene is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

6. To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 = (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards
2. The remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48 cards
3. Then, find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards
4. The remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24 cards
5. Finally, find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards
6. The remaining cards are 24 - 15 = 9 cards, which have the letter D.

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. Since we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, let's denote their current ages as Mico's age = x and Marco's age = 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (20 - x + 10) = 30 + 10 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total number of spots, we first need to find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras, so the total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800.

There are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100.

The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900.

Half the number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To determine the total number of people attending the soccer game, we need to calculate the number of team members, coaches, and their guests.

Number of team members: 12
Number of coaches: 3
Number of guests per team member: 2
Total number of guests: 12 * 2 = 24
Total number of people: 12 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find the number of pizzas needed:
39 / 3 = 13

Since Maddy can't buy a fraction of a pizza, she will need to buy 13 pizzas.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost will be:
13 * $15 = $195

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the total length of the topaz gemstones in each necklace, we multiply the number of gemstones by their length: 
8 gemstones * 1 inch = 8 inches

Since the total length of the necklace is 25 inches, we subtract the length of the gemstones to find the length of the silver beads: 
25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Now, we divide the length of the silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads: 
17 inches / 0.25 inches = 68 beads

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories written, we need to calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week and then add them together.

In the first week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
In the first week, Margot wrote 60 stories, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add the total number of stories written by each person in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

Total number of stories written: 60 + 120 + 180 = 360

"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of her quarters is 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of her dimes is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the value of her quarters and dimes: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, which is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, which is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
So, the total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5, which is 40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones being transported. 

Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones, the total weight is:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the weight capacity of the truck (2000 pounds) to find out how many trucks are needed:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. This means that 39 is 10 times less than 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 39 = (1/10)x

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 10: 
x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting.

Final answer: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. Since there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8: 16 / 8 = 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works. 

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * $5 = $75.

Now, let's check if each player has over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's initial points:
- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim's points: 18 points
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add the points of all three players:

"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice in the bag (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."

"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total cost of driving = Total miles driven per year * $2/mile = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile = $43,200/year

Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find the weight loss per week.

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can set up an equation to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Let's say it takes Sandy 'x' weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, we can set up the equation:

2x = 8

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x / 2 = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract that from the total cost of the trip: 
$1950 - $2000 = -$50

However, since we can't spend a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the calculation. The issue is that the total cost of the trip ($1950) is less than the amount Theo wants to save ($2000). This means Theo has enough money to cover the costs of the trip and still have $50 left over. 

Since Theo has enough money to cover the costs and still have $50 left over, he can spend the $50 on gifts for his business partners in South Africa."

2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can calculate Noah's age six years ago as follows:
   Noah's age six years ago = Cera's age six years ago
   Since Cera is 46 years old now, Cera's age six years ago = 46 - 6 = 40
   Noah's age six years ago = 40

2. Now, we can calculate Noah's current age:
   Noah's current age = Noah's age six years ago + 6
   Noah's current age = 40 + 6
   Noah's current age = 46

3. Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. We can calculate the population of Chile six years ago:
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
   Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 40
   Population of Chile six years ago = 120000

4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can calculate the current population of Chile:
   Population of Chile now = 2 * Population of Chile six years ago
   Population of Chile now = 2 * 120000
   Population of Chile now = 240000

The final answer is: 240000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Since his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and Solomon bought 20 marbles, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

2. Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) and the marbles his father gave him (8) to find the total number of marbles in the store. 20 + 8 = 28 marbles.

3. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight. 28 * 2 = 56 kgs.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 56 kgs.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation: 
3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

"To find the total number of people at the party initially, we need to add the number of men and women.

Total people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:
Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is:
Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:
Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.
2. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

We know that 3x + 2 = 26 (total pencils Jam has). 

Now, we can solve for 'x': 
3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

So, each box has 8 pencils. 

Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which is a total of 3*8 + 2 = 26 pencils. 

Now, let's add Meg's pencils to Jam's pencils: 
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 
72 / 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee.

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and Shannon adds 5 ice cubes (assuming she uses 5 ice cubes to cool the coffee by 65 degrees), the total cooling effect is:

5 ice cubes * 13 degrees/ice cube = 65 degrees

Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can say that the coffee is now at 0 degrees (assuming it was initially at 65 degrees). This means the coffee has been cooled by 65 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the weakening effect of the added cream. Each added milliliter of cream makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, the total weakening effect is:

15 milliliters * 12 milliliters/milliliter = 180 milliliters

However, this is the total weakening effect, not the weakening effect per degree. To find the weakening effect per degree, we need to divide the total weakening effect by the total cooling effect:

180 milliliters / 65 degrees = 2.77 milliliters/degree

Now, we can calculate the total weakening effect of the cooling:

65 degrees * 2.77 milliliters/degree = 180.35 milliliters

Since the coffee is already weakened by 180 milliliters, we can subtract the weakening effect of the cooling from the total weakening effect:

180 milliliters - 180 milliliters = 0 milliliters

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is 0 milliliters because the coffee is already weakened by the 180 milliliters of cream, and the cooling effect does not add to the weakening effect.

The final answer is 0."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of new records the 5 people received. We know that they left with 7 new records.

Since each person received 7 new records, and there are 5 people, the total number of new records is 7 * 5 = 35.

We also know that 2 old records are required to get 1 new record. So, to get 35 new records, the total number of old records required is 35 * 2 = 70.

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 70 old records.

70"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can calculate the salary of a senior programmer as follows:

Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we can calculate the total number of senior programmers as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month as follows:

Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 more got on at the second stop. So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we know that 7 people got off at the second stop. To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to add the number of people who got off at the second stop to the total number of people heading to the third stop. 

So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 13 + 7 = 20.

Therefore, 20 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and received $1 off for every $20 spent. Since $80 is 4 times $20, they received 4 rewards. 

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the rewards they received were halved. 

The customer received 4 rewards, but they were halved, so they received 4 / 2 = 2 rewards. 

The rewards they received were worth $1 each, so they received 2 * $1 = $2 off.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: $80 - $2 = $78.

The customer paid $78 on this shopping trip."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of each animal and then add the weight of the container.

We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals: 
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree. 
So, the height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, we know the heights of the two shorter trees. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. 
The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees, which is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items Dean bought is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he had $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will have to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. We know that the total cost of the activities is $30, and we want to find out how many friends she can invite.

Let's assume the cost per person is x. Then, the total cost of the activities for n friends will be $30n. Since each friend will pay for their own activities, the total cost of the activities for n friends is equal to the cost per person multiplied by the number of friends.

$30n = x * n

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by n:
$30 = x

So, the cost per person is $30. Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person to find out how many friends she can invite:
$60 ÷ $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her party.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, which is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

So, the amount she saves each day is $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is $4 * 5 = $20.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy had initially. He had $10.

He spent $1.5 on candy. So, the amount of money left is $10 - $1.5 = $8.5.

He took half of the change, which is $8.5 / 2 = $4.25. He spent this amount on gumballs.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, the number of gumballs he bought is $4.25 / $0.05 = 85.

We know that Billy bought 40 gumballs. This means that the amount he spent on gumballs ($4.25) is equal to the amount he would have spent on 85 gumballs ($0.05 * 85 = $4.25).

Now, we need to find out how much money he had initially to buy 40 gumballs. Since he spent $4.25 on 85 gumballs, he must have had $4.25 * 40 / 85 = $1.5 to buy 40 gumballs.

Since he initially had $10 and spent $1.5 on candy, the amount of money left is $10 - $1.5 = $8.5.

Now, we know that he had $1.5 to buy 40 gumballs. We also know that he spent $1.5 on candy. This means that the amount of money he had initially ($8.5) is equal to the amount he had to buy 40 gumballs ($1.5) plus the amount he spent on candy ($1.5).

However, this is not the case. The correct approach is to find the amount of money he had initially to buy 40 gumballs and then subtract the amount he spent on candy.

Since he spent $4.25 on 85 gumballs, he must have had $4.25 * 40 / 85 = $1.5 to buy 40 gumballs.

Now, we know that he had $1.5 to buy 40 gumballs and he spent $1.5 on candy. This means that the amount of money he had initially ($1.5) is equal to the amount he had to buy 40 gumballs ($1.5) plus the amount he spent on candy ($1.5).

However, this is still not correct. We need to find the amount of money he had initially to buy 40 gumballs and then subtract the amount he spent on candy.

Since he spent $1.5 on candy, the amount of money he had initially to buy 40 gumballs is $1.5 + $1.5 = $3.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the son's age as 'x'. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can set up the equation:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two).

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the train will complete the trip before the next service, so it will go 0 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey.

First, we calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house:

Next, we add the detour:
Detour distance = 10 miles
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles
Time taken to drive to his friend's house = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to his friend's house + Time taken to drive back home
Total time = 3 + 3 = 6 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. 
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   This means 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   This means 3 * 7 = 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. 
   We have already accounted for 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 customers.
   To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract 31 from 50.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin had 3x points before. 
We know Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 
To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3 = 4.67. 

So Sara had 4.67 points before. 
Since Erin had 3 times more points than Sara, Erin had 3 * 4.67 = 14 points before."

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400
Materials cost = 0.8 * $400
Materials cost = $320

Now, we need to add the cost of the materials to the cost of the materials to find the total cost.

Total cost = Materials cost + Original cost
Total cost = $320 + $400
Total cost = $720

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $720."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returns) = 50.

"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to calculate the hours for each day and add them together.

Hallie had 1 hour of dance practice on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. 
So, the total hours for these two days are 1 + 2 = 3 hours.

On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 hours. 
So, the total hours for Saturdays is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

Now, let's add the hours for all three days: 3 hours (Tuesdays and Thursdays) + 4 hours (Saturdays) = 7 hours.

Therefore, Hallie had 7 hours of dance practice per week.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Total amount spent = $400,000
Percentage of faulty pieces = 40%

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000 = 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is 400,000 and 160,000 are faulty, the number of functioning pieces is:
400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000

Now, we need to find the value of the functioning pieces. Since the faulty pieces are 40% of the total, the functioning pieces are 60% of the total.
Value of functioning pieces = 60% of $400,000 = 0.6 * 400,000 = $240,000

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

She has 30 sheep, so half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her 6 children.

She started with 12 rolls and fed 6 to her children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into: 6 * 8 = 48.

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.
2. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.
3. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.
4. The rest of the pupils like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount of money she made ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, and she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the total number of apples picked over the three days: 
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of pairs and the number of loose socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
Cookies left after brother ate some: 23 - 44 = -21

Since you can't have a negative number of cookies, it means that there are not enough cookies left for Rachel."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest rate and then divide the total amount by the number of months.

The monthly interest rate is 10% / 12 = 0.008333 (approximately).

The total amount Karan borrowed is $3,650.

The monthly payment can be calculated using the formula: 
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
Monthly payment = $3,650 / 5
Monthly payment = $730

So, Karan has to pay $730 per month.

"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the two distances.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

The answer is 67."
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue will be 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18 (profit)

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: 
$18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he sold 3/5 * x hectares. The amount he has left is 2/5 of the original amount, which is 2/5 * x hectares.

We know that the amount he has left is 12.8 hectares. So, we can set up the equation:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 26. Since the choir is performing with just its female members, the number of girls performing is 26.

However, half of the people performing can't make it to the show. This means that 50% of the total number of people performing will be absent. Since the choir is performing with just its female members, we need to find 50% of the total number of girls. 50% of 26 is 13.

So, the number of girls performing is 26 - 13 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people performing is 13 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 16.

"To find the total number of parts in the ratio, we add 5 + 6 = 11. 

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we divide 165 by 11 to find the value of each part: 165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Now, we multiply the value of each part by the number of parts for each person: 
Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month for both services.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Now, let's calculate the savings by canceling the cable subscription. 
The cost of the cable subscription is $60 per month. 
The cost of the streaming services is $18 per month. 
The savings is $60 - $18 = $42 per month.

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by canceling his cable subscription.

"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 4 hours
- Recording time: 1.5 hours
- Editing time: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we'll divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 / 7) * 100 = 21.43%

"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find the total capacity of the shelving system. 

Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. 

20 more than double the number of books is 72 + 20 = 92.

So, Wendy needs 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she initially had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has: 
Initial cards: 50
Cards received: 17
Cards given away: 29

Total cards Erica now has: 50 + 17 - 29 = 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To find out how many slices Jenny has initially, we need to add the fractions 1/3 and 1/4. 

First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 3 and 4, which is 12. 

Now, we convert both fractions to have the same denominator:
1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, we can convert this to a decimal or find the whole number equivalent. 

7/12 is approximately 0.583, or 5 whole slices and 7/12 of a slice.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract 2 from 5 whole slices:
5 - 2 = 3

Now, we need to add the remaining 7/12 to 3. To do this, we convert 3 to a fraction with the same denominator (12):
3 = 36/12

Now, we add the fractions:
36/12 + 7/12 = 43/12

To convert 43/12 to a whole number, we divide 43 by 12:
43 ÷ 12 = 3.583

So, Jenny has 3 whole slices and 11/12 of a slice left.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has. 

$50 (initial amount) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortfall)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, this means he doesn't have enough money to buy the bike. He needs more money to cover the cost.

However, if we consider the scenario where Mark can save money, we can calculate the number of days he needs to save:

$300 (bike cost) / $10 (daily earnings) = 30 days

So, Mark needs 30 days to save enough money to buy the bike if he saves $10 per day.

Final answer: 30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders: 90
Number of millipedes: 1/3rd of 90 = 90 / 3 = 30

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. In 8 hours a day, it uses 8 * 900 = 7200 watts per day.

In 30 days, it will use 7200 * 30 = 216,000 watts.

Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts, we can convert 216,000 watts to kilowatts by dividing by 1000.

216,000 / 1000 = 216 kilowatts.

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new usage will be 8 - 5 = 3 hours per day.

The new daily energy usage will be 3 * 900 = 2700 watts.

In 30 days, the new daily energy usage will be 2700 * 30 = 81,000 watts.

Converting this to kilowatts, we get 81,000 / 1000 = 81 kilowatts.

The energy saved will be the difference between the original energy usage and the new energy usage: 216 - 81 = 135 kilowatts.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:

- 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

We also know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

However, we are told that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. This means he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house: 100 cannolis + 60 corns = 160.

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and also explode. However, we don't have information about the percentage of candles that explode. 

We know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, but we don't know if this is the same percentage that also explode. To find the answer, we would need more information about the relationship between the two defects.

However, assuming that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, we can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = 5% of 50000
= 0.05 x 50000
= 2500

So, 2500 candles smell like wet dog. If we assume that this is also the percentage that explode, then:

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode = 5% of 50000
= 0.05 x 50000
= 2500

Therefore, 2500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60) = 440 - 3x.

Since Joanne gathers apples from the average trees, the number of apples she gathers from the average trees is 440 - 3x.

However, we know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. So, the number of apples she gathers from the average trees is 30 + (440 - 3x) = 470 - 3x.

Since the problem states that Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than from the tallest trees, we can set up the inequality 470 - 3x > 30.

Simplifying the inequality, we get 440 - 3x > 0.

Solving for x, we get x < 440/3, which is approximately 146.67.

Since x must be a whole number, the maximum value of x is 146.

Now, we can find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees: 470 - 3 * 146 = 470 - 438 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can set up the following equation:

2C + D = 304 (total number of bumps)

We also know that the total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can set up another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for C and D by solving these equations simultaneously.

First, let's solve the second equation for C:

C = 180 - D

Now, substitute this expression for C into the first equation:

2(180 - D) + D = 304

Expand and simplify:

360 - 2D + D = 304

Combine like terms:

360 - D = 304

Subtract 360 from both sides:

-D = -56

Multiply both sides by -1:

D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

Final answer: 56"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom made a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the elevation at which Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb, we need to subtract Oliver's current elevation from the elevation of Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. 

10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet

Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000
Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

Final answer: 17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

2. The initial number of cats was 50. After 20 cats were taken away, the remaining number of cats is 50 - 20 = 30.

3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

4. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods:

1. The first 6 months: $8 per month
   6 months * $8 per month = $48

2. The next 8 months: $12 per month
   8 months * $12 per month = $96

3. The last 8 months: $14 per month
   8 months * $14 per month = $112

Now, we add the costs of all three periods:
$48 + $96 + $112 = $256

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the total amount Cole saved. Since he saved a total of $6 and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6. 

We know that 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans, so 2/3 * (x + 6) = 2/3 * (28 - 6) = 2/3 * 22 = 14.66. 

Now, we can set up the equation: 2/3 * (x + 6) = 14.66. 

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3/2: x + 6 = 14.66 * 3/2 = 22. 

Now, we subtract 6 from both sides: x = 22 - 6 = 16.

Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is 16 - 6 = 10.

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is 16 - 10 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

570"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Since the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 homemade feeders and 3 store-bought feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds, and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the prices of the soup and the cake.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs 4 + (25% of 4) = 4 + (0.25 * 4) = 4 + 1 = $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake: 5 + 4 + 2 = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's assume Kenny starts with x cards.

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. He sells 2/3 of the cards for $1.5 each, so the total amount he gets from selling the cards is:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = (2/3)x * 1.5 = $1x

Kenny has $50 in spending cash, so the total amount he has is $1x + $50.

Since the total amount he has is equal to the cost of the amusement park ticket ($100), we can set up the equation:

$1x + $50 = $100

Subtracting $50 from both sides gives us:

$1x = $50

Dividing both sides by $1 gives us:

x = 50

So, Kenny starts with 50 cards.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we calculate this as 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer initially prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, but 40 guests showed up. Since 18 guests already had two hotdogs, the remaining 40 - 18 = 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

So, Charlotte's order would cost $132.00 after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $132."
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora currently has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1/4 of 15 gallons is 15 * 1/4 = 15/4 = 3.75 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3.75 gallons to pints. 

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can assume that 1% of his total money is 1 cent. This means he spent 99% of his money, which is 99 cents.

Now, we know that George spent 120 cents on chips and 99 cents on candy bars. The total amount he spent is 120 + 99 = 219 cents.

Since George spent 5 dollars, we can convert this to cents: 5 * 100 = 500 cents.

Now, we can find out how much money George had initially: 500 - 219 = 281 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can find the initial amount of money he had: 281 * 100 = 28.1 dollars.

Now, we can find out how many candy bars George bought: 28.1 - 3 * 0.4 = 28.1 - 1.2 = 26.9. Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to 26 candy bars.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we divide 20 by 4:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece
Total weight of the pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends. 

Total number of people = 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56

Now, divide the total oranges by the total number of people: 
56 / 8 = 7

Everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then find out how much earlier she should leave.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, if Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open, and it's open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the window is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window. The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase due to oven - Temperature decrease due to window
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 1 hour 20 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run)
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to calculate James' swim time.
James' swim time = 40 - (10% of 40)
10% of 40 = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim and bike times, but we don't know his run time. Let's denote James' run time as 'x'. We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.

James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

James' total time = 36 (swim) + 85 (bike) + x (run)
36 + 85 + x = 180
121 + x = 180
x = 59 minutes

So, James took 59 minutes to complete the run."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to first find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. 

Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance it runs in 30 minutes as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time in hours = 30 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.5 hours
Distance = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and a bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of hay for 16 miles is:

Cost of hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile * $3/bail
Cost of hay = 16 * 1.5 * $3
Cost of hay = $72

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, which is a total of $30. 

Change = Total money - Cost of hay
Change = $30 - $72
Change = -$42

Since Michael doesn't have enough money to buy the hay, he is short $42.

"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to add the number of eggs in the cases and the number of loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses she can fill. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of the popcorn as P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of buying a super ticket.

The cost of a super ticket is $20, and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost of a super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 (movie ticket) + P (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = $15 + P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:

$15 + P = $21

Subtracting $15 from both sides of the equation gives us:

P = $6

So, the regular price of popcorn is $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since 20 balloons cost $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

45 + 20 = 65

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost of one balloon by 170:

65 * 170 = 11,100

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,100 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as:
Volume = Length * Width * Height
Volume = 8 feet * 2 feet * 2 feet
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet * 10
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total Volume / 2
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2
Number of bags = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 bags * $12
Total cost = $1920

The total cost of the potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden is $1920."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the number of red cards and add it to the number of red cards.

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Since the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

Now, let's add up the number of cards of all colors:
Number of red cards = 15
Number of green cards = 24
Number of yellow cards = 39
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
   Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. 
   So, 25 fairies join the initial 50 fairies, making a total of 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.
3. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12). 

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35%"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips needed:
3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

To find out her earnings in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Frederick has 10 plants.
2. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. 
   To find the number of plants Toni has, we need to calculate 60% of 10 and add it to 10.

"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = $9. 
She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = $10.
She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 = 0.10 x 10 = $1.
So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = $1.

The difference in the amount paid by Kelly and Becky is $1."
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by 80.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets

- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Now, let's add up the total number of items per room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 items per room

To find the total number of items in 80 rooms, we multiply the number of items per room by 80:
15 items per room * 80 rooms = 1200 items

The total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Total shoes before Saturday = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. 

To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100: (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We know that one-fourth of the students equals 20. 

So, (1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances.

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 kids are allergic to peanuts. However, 3 kids are allergic to both. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the total number of kids allergic to each substance.

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to at least one substance

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. The increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. 

So, the daily consumption for one horse is 5 pounds * 2 meals = 10 pounds per day.

For four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds * 4 horses = 40 pounds per day.

Since Uncle Ben needs oats for five days, the total amount of oats required is 40 pounds * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are needed. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. 

To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total amount of oats required (200 pounds) by the weight of oats in one bag (50 pounds).

Since the razors come 4 to a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

The original price of 2 packs is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, the total cost of 2 packs will be $8.00.

Now, we need to subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost. $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Since there are 8 razors in 2 packs, we need to divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost of each individual razor. $6.00 / 8 = $0.75.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2 per week.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of cows and sheep from both places to find the total number of animals.

Total number of animals = 30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo)
Total number of animals = 30 + 60 + 10 + 20
Total number of animals = 120

The farm and zoo have 120 animals combined."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4, since Rose bought 4 times the number of each item Sophia bought.

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

3 + 1 = 4"
"To determine the calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to reach his goal. 

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 181 days (approximately 6 months and 19 days).

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to be burned by the number of days: 
105,000 calories / 181 days ≈ 578 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 578 calories to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. In a week, he would earn 7 * $30 = $210.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20) = $40 + $120 = $160.

2. Ali gives half of the total money to his sister: 
   Half of $160 = $160 / 2 = $80. 
   Remaining money = $160 - $80 = $80.

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner: 
   3/5 of $80 = (3/5) * $80 = $48. 
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32.

The final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60.

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to find double the time it takes Rob and add 40 minutes.

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes
Adding 40 minutes to this = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the amount each person can pick and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the quarts each person can pick per hour: 
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original weekly consumption and the new weekly consumption.

Original weekly consumption: 
Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. 
There are 7 days in a week, so her original weekly consumption is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour.

New weekly consumption: 
The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. 
So, her new weekly consumption is 84 + 2 = 86 kilowatts per hour.

Original weekly bill: 
The cost of 1 kilowatt per hour is $1.50. 
So, her original weekly bill is 84 * $1.50 = $126.

New weekly bill: 
Her new weekly bill is 86 * $1.50 = $129.

The difference in her weekly electric bill is $129 - $126 = $3.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house by doubling the time. 

So, it would take one person 5 * 2 = 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can divide the time by 5 to find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house.

10 days / 5 people = 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply the number of days by 24 to find the total hours.

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. 

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs she has. Let's denote the number of chairs as 'x'. 

Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can write the equation as: 
20 = x - 2

To find the value of 'x', we add 2 to both sides of the equation:
x = 20 + 2
x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find out how many chairs Jenna has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can multiply the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3:
Jenna's chairs = 3 * 22
Jenna's chairs = 66

Now we know Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 66 chairs. To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs together:
Total = 20 (sofas) + 22 (chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs)
Total = 108

"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to first find out how much he spent on the CD.

Tom spent $48 in total and $4 on the CD. So, the amount he spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we can divide the amount spent on the headphone set by the cost of a CD:

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. This means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off at the second stop get on the bus. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 + 7 = 66.

Therefore, there are 66 passengers riding the bus after the second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 8 years old, which is x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 13 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

8 = x

So, Jame's current age is 8 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 13 years old, which is 8 + 13 = 21 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 21 - 8 = 13 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

The total cost of all three items is $2,400. To find the cost of one monitor, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Therefore, one monitor cost $600.

102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. 
Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

To find out how many weeks it will take to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

It will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3. 

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $120

Now, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost of lunch.

Total cost of lunch = $40 + $120
Total cost of lunch = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes. The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size: 12 * 1/4 = 12 * 0.25 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to multiply the amount Octavia drinks by 10. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, she drinks 0.5 cups. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 0.5 = 5 cups.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract 4 from 5. 

5 - 4 = 1

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup.

"To find the total number of rodents, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

Number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters
Number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

Final answer: 180"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in angle of the sun relative to the ground. 

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. Since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the angle from the initial angle to get the final angle. 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, and it moves for 10 hours. So, the change in angle is 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Now, we subtract the change in angle from the initial angle: 32 - 50 = -18 degrees.

However, since the sun is moving upward, the negative sign indicates that the angle is decreasing. To get the final angle, we need to take the absolute value of the result, which is 18 degrees.

The final angle from the ground to the sun is 18 degrees.

"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his older son. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Since the older son is 12 years old, James needs 12 candles for him. The younger son needs 8 candles. In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how much James spends on candles, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 and multiply by the cost per pack.

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12

James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in 105 minutes by dividing 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week: 
70 + 100 = 170 pages

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we need to follow the given information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
3. Richie scored 80 goals.

Let's start by finding the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can set up an equation:
Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = Mark's goals + 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We can set up another equation:
Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = Anna's goals + 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold (21) by the price of each lemonade ($4). 

21 * 4 = 84

Since Liam made $63, we subtract this from Mitchell's total to find the difference.

84 - 63 = 21

Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day, so he spent a total of $5 * 3 = $15 on wooden action figures.

He had $70 initially, so after spending $15, he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has $55 left, he can buy $55 / $2 = 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures (from Sunday to Wednesday) and 27 plastic action figures (from Thursday to Saturday), making a total of 3 + 27 = 30 action figures.

The final answer is 30."

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of the 3 vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60.
The cost of the broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops in a month. 

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses he supplies per week by 4.

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses
Total roses supplied in a month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses

Since Ford grows 40 roses every week, we need to find out how many roses he grows in a month.
Total roses grown in a month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses

Now, we subtract the total roses grown from the total roses supplied to find out how many roses Ford lacks.
Roses lacking = Total roses supplied - Total roses grown
Roses lacking = 260 - 160
Roses lacking = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

Final answer: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 1
Cost of bread = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves
Cost of bread = $3.00 * 1
Cost of bread = $3.00

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first find out how many crayons she has in total. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 / 8 = 24

Now, we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
Average = Total number of birds / Number of days
Average = 280 / 7
Average = 40

The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40."

The total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 is 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees."
"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is 0.10 * $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the cost of each pair of contacts. Since 90 single-use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days, we can divide the total number of contacts by 45 to find the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = 90 / 45 = 2

Now, we can divide the total cost by the number of pairs to find the cost of each pair.

Cost per pair = $180.00 / 2 = $90.00

"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned.

200 calorie units = 1600 / 200
200 calorie units = 8

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of units by 100.

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write another equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 / $0.05 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Total games after 3 years: 17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games

"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so the amount of money he has left is $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find the total number of rotations, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile and then multiply by the number of months in a year.

First, let's find the number of rotations per mile:
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's find the total number of rotations per month:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total number of rotations per month by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire needs to be replaced in 6 years."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

Now, we need to convert the cost from dollars to cents. 
$12.00 = 1200 cents

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax first. 
Sales tax rate is not given, but we can assume it's a standard 8% sales tax. 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he won't have any money left after the purchase.

Final answer: $0"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 336 croissants, we multiply 336 by 1/4:

336 * 1/4 = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to first calculate the cost of repaving his street. 

Cost per meter = $194
Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters

Cost of repaving Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost of repaving Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost of repaving Lewis' street = $95060

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between Monica's street and Lewis' street. 

Cost of repaving Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost of repaving Monica's street = $29,100

Difference in cost = Cost of repaving Lewis' street - Cost of repaving Monica's street

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

The funding for the remaining 5 months is as follows:
- Month 6: $150,000
- Month 7: $225,000
- Month 8: $337,500
- Month 9: $506,250
- Month 10: $757,812.50

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the remaining 5 months:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $757,812.50 = $2,380,562.50

Adding the cost of the first 5 months and the remaining 5 months, we get:
$500,000 + $2,380,562.50 = $2,880,562.50

So, the total cost of John's research is $2,880,562.50."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat. 

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so we calculate the number of seats occupied by administrators:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so we calculate the number of seats occupied by parents:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are 54 - 18 = 36 seats, which are occupied by students.

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The cost of the cars for James is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500 per car. 

Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost for him is $17,500 * 10 = $175,000. 

The total revenue from selling the cars is $25,000 * 10 = $250,000. 

The profit is $250,000 - $175,000 = $75,000. 

James got a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 0.1 * $75,000 = $7,500.

"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can calculate the number of women who can stay upright as follows:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Since the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond + Price of gold + Price of silver
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of truck stamps and rose stamps Max bought.

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed can't be negative, we need to consider the direction. In this case, we'll assume Bob is driving away from Tom, so we'll use the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class).

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $10
Total cost of classes = $100

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the total cost exceeds $100, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the total cost exceeds $100.

Let's assume Manny misses 'x' classes. The total cost will be:
Total cost = (10 - x) * $10

We want to find the maximum value of 'x' such that the total cost is less than or equal to $100.

(10 - x) * $10 ≤ $100
10 - x ≤ $10
x ≥ $0

Since Manny can't miss a negative number of classes, the maximum number of classes he can miss is 0.

However, the question asks how many classes he can miss before his parents won't sign him up again. Since his parents won't sign him up again if the total cost exceeds $100, Manny can miss 9 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50

Now, let's add the costs together: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the hole. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time it will take to dig the hole.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus amount.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

His new monthly salary will be: 
$20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 2 = $10000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21000 + $10000 = $31000

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31000 * 12 = $372000

The final answer is: 372000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 10 dress shirts is 10 * $60 = $600.

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600.

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To calculate the total number of articles published, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website in February and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so their son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / (1/2) feet/hour = 8 * 2 = 16 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 16 hours
Total time = 22 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 22 hours.

"To find the initial number of likes, we need to divide the total number of likes by 70. 

Initial number of likes = Total likes / 70
Initial number of likes = 2000 / 70
Initial number of likes = 28.57

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to 28.

Now, we need to add the 20000 new likes to the initial number of likes. 

Total likes = Initial likes + New likes
Total likes = 28 + 20000
Total likes = 20028

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On the second day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost was:
20 * $30 = $600
10% of $600 is $60, so the discount is $60
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and the result is negative, it means that Clara paid less than Sheila."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate the sales for each month.

In the first month, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. So, the sales from green hats in the first month were 2 * $400 = $800.

The total sales in the first month were $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month were 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

The total amount she made in two months is $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

Final answer: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total deviled egg halves: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs).

Total eggs: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12
Total dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the total number of days.

Days left = 30 - 20

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000. 

The monthly rent is $5000. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total rent for the year is 12 * $5000 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the rent, so the monthly fuel cost is 2 * $5000 = $10,000. The total fuel cost for the year is 12 * $10,000 = $120,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the total rent, and the total fuel cost: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of this time is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations to find the number of sheep. 

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40.

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation: (4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40
This simplifies to 2s = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90. 
100% - 60% = 40%. 
40% of 150 is 0.4 * 150 = 60. 

There are 60 math teachers. 

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 60 * 6 = 360 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To find out how much each person would have if they share the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

So, if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, each person would have 120 dollars.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days in the month. 

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and 10 neutral days in the first 30 days. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in the month. 
12 (good) + 8 (bad) + 10 (neutral) = 30 days

Since the first 30 days have already passed, we need to add the next 3 days. 
3 (good) + 1 (neutral) + 3 (good) = 7 days

Now, we need to subtract the total number of days that have passed from the total number of days in the month. 
30 (total days) - 30 (days passed) = 0 days

However, we need to subtract the 3 good days that have passed in the last 3 days. 
0 - 3 = -3

Since we can't have negative days, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's re-examine the information given. 

The problem states that Christina's first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. This means that the first 24 days were accounted for. 

Now, we need to add the next 3 days. 
3 (good) + 1 (neutral) + 3 (good) = 7 days

Since the first 24 days were accounted for, we need to subtract the 24 days from the total number of days in the month. 
30 (total days) - 24 (accounted for) = 6 days

Now, we need to subtract the 3 good days that have passed in the last 3 days. 
6 - 3 = 3

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. The difference between 600 and 240 is 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the total inches needed (360) by the daily growth rate (30) to find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

360 / 30 = 12

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we calculate 2/5 of $1200.
   2/5 * 1200 = (2 * 1200) / 5 = 2400 / 5 = 480

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount.
   1200 - 480 = 720

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We calculate 2/3 of 720.
   2/3 * 720 = (2 * 720) / 3 = 1440 / 3 = 480

"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

Since the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, we need to subtract this from the total weight to find the excess.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The elevator will exceed its maximum load by 20 kg."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally add up all the cookies.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies: 
68 + 5 = 73 cookies for Max.

Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies:
73 - 12 = 61 cookies for the Cookie Monster.

Now, we have the number of cookies for all three: Katarina (68), Max (73), and the Cookie Monster (61). To find the total number of cookies, we add them up:
68 + 73 + 61 = 202

The total number of cookies is 202."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length of the dress is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

Total time available = 30 minutes
Time spent walking to the corner = 6 minutes
Time spent walking to the fire station = 13 minutes
Total time spent walking so far = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time available - Total time spent walking so far
Time left to get to school = 30 - 19 = 11 minutes

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we need to multiply the number of cookies Greta bakes by 2. 

Celinda bakes 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

We also know that there is a set of triplets, so the age of the triplet would be 'x + 7' as well. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplet are 44. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3x = 30

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 10

So, the age of the younger twin is 10 years.

The age of the older twin is 10 + 7 = 17 years.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert 3 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time:
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10: 
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (since 10 is 2.5 times 4): 
$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies: 
$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00.

"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year and then multiply by the number of years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. In 10 years, Rong will have saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per year. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month. 2/5 of 20 is 8, so Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year. In 10 years, Neil will have saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have together, we add the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved. 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as x. 
0.6x = 60

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.6. 
x = 60 / 0.6
x = 100

The total bill is $100. The cost of the vaccines is $40. 
$100 - $40 = $60

John brought $125. He leaves with $125 - $60 = $65."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

The total number of squares is 68.

"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can multiply 8 by 5 to find the number of regular chairs.

8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to find the total number of chairs needed.

40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48

Since there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to add 57 chairs in total. However, Mia already has 48 chairs. To find out how many more chairs she needs, we subtract 48 from 57.

57 - 48 = 9

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

First, we need to find the number of bucks. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of bucks as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Now, we need to find 20% of the number of bucks:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2

So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Tom: 35

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city display and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city display:
15 boxes of 20 fireworks each = 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
40% of 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard:
3 boxes of 5 fireworks each = 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city display and her backyard:
120 (city fireworks) + 15 (backyard fireworks) = 135 fireworks

"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of people, drinks, and snacks.

There are 12 friends initially, plus 7 more friends, making a total of 19 people. Since each person has a seat, 19 seats are needed. 

Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks and snacks needed is:
- Drinks: 19 seats * 2 drinks per seat = 38 drinks
- Snacks: 19 seats * 3 snacks per seat = 57 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost is:
- Drinks: 38 drinks * $2 per drink = $76
- Snacks: 57 snacks * $2 per snack = $114

The total amount spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined weight of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.
4. When Gary joins the two of them, the total weight they can haul is 11,600 pounds.
5. To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we need to subtract the combined weight of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total weight: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings."
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5.

Since Gerald spent $10, we can find out how much money he had initially by multiplying the total amount ($100) by the ratio of his part (3/5). 

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100 = 60

Now, we subtract the amount he spent ($10) from his initial amount to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10 = 50

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 feet/second / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

They have already raised $2100, and their goal is $6300. 

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount they raise. 

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% of 40% is greater than 40%. 

Let's recalculate the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by finding the percentage of the river's total water used by the city and subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%.

First, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city. Since 80% of 40% is 32%, we can set up an equation to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city:

Let x be the percentage of the river's total water used by the city.
0.8x = 32

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8:

x = 32 / 0.8
x = 40

Now that we know the city uses 40% of the river's total water, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 40% from 100%:

100% - 40% = 60%

Therefore, 60% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the production rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the production rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production in 48 hours: 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 3 people, they ate 2 x 2/3 = 4/3 pizzas. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 4 by 3, which is approximately 1.33 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1.33 x 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for these 2 people, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1.5 pizzas. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 1.5 by 1, which is 1.5 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 1.5 x 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by all 5 people: 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. 
The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Now, we have the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages (20 minutes) and the time it takes the cat to eat the sausages (30 minutes). 

To find the average time, we add the two times together and divide by 2. 
Average time = (20 + 30) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Now we solve for 'x': 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars: 
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed for students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256

For teachers' cars:
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed for teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students) + 64 (teachers) = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by midday and then add the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.

By midday, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people had voted by midday.

The remaining people who had not voted by midday are:
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people had voted between midday and 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
3000 - 2000 = 1000 people.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he needs for 30 days.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day, so for 30 days, he will need:
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Since each pack has 15 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces per pack:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To find out how many smores the kids will eat, multiply the number of kids by the number of smores each kid wants: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores.

To find out how many smores the adults will eat, multiply the number of adults by the number of smores each adult wants: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores.

Now, add the total number of smores the kids and adults will eat: 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed: 24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the number of boxes needed is equal to the number of sleeves needed: 3 sleeves/box = 3 boxes.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Combined age = Dora's age + father's age + mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years.

"To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples. 

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck initially has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount:

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many books Steven has. 

20 / 2 = 10

So, Steven has 10 books.

Now, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Since Steven has 10 books, Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has.

20 - 16 = 4

Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Cost of 10-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a gallon jar
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent:

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to first find the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total number of students is 50, and 10 + 5 = 15 students like to bake or play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - 15 = 35.

Since 10 students like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and two classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 / 2 = 40 students in each class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

"To find the total cost of the packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Mark gets 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the total value of these two cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards Mark got is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: 
$6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups required (12). However, the question states that 12 groups are already required, but the activity requires 6 groups. 

Since 54 divided by 6 equals 9, and 54 divided by 12 equals 4.5, it seems there's a discrepancy. 

Given the information, it appears there might be a mistake in the question. However, if we follow the original instruction, we can calculate the number of groups needed to accommodate 54 students in 6 groups:

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

Since 54 students cannot be evenly divided into 6 groups, we need to re-evaluate the question. 

If the activity requires 12 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group:

54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students per group

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, it seems the question contains an error. However, if we assume the question is asking how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups, we can calculate the number of groups already formed:

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

To form 12 groups, we need:

9 students per group * 12 groups = 108 students

Since we have 54 students, we need:

108 students - 54 students = 54 more students

However, the question asks for the number of groups, not students. Since we need 54 more students to form 12 groups, we can calculate the number of groups needed:

54 students / 9 students per group = 6 groups

So, 6 more groups are needed to form 12 groups.

"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

In a 4-week month, there are 20 weekdays (4 weeks * 5 weekdays per week) and 8 weekend days (4 weeks * 2 weekend days per week). 

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in a 4-week month is 20 * 60 = 1200.

The number of chairs rented during weekends in a 4-week month is 8 * 100 = 800.

The total number of chairs rented in a 4-week month is 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Since we are asked to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2.

The total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is 2000 * 2 = 4000.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

Since a large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, she can convert her large stickers to small stickers.
20 large stickers * 3 small stickers per large sticker = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 63 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 123 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, she has 123 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 143 buttons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the information that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. 

Since the total number of council members is 33, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation would be 2x (twice the number of votes against it). 

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"

4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. 60% of 40 people is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. We can set up another equation:
2/3 * total puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
total puppies = 18 * 3/2
total puppies = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 (vanilla) - 16 (fruity) = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 * 3 = $60 from eggplants.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he made $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide $75 by 25 ears of corn.

$75 / 25 = $3 per ear of corn.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. So, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes him to drive to the museum and back.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, the total time he is gone from home is the sum of the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total wheels needed: 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total wheels needed from the number of wheels available in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

There will be 276 wheels left."
"To find the amount you have to pay after the discount, you need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 is 0.20 * $1000 = $200.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $1000 - $200 = $800.

So, you have to pay $800.

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as:
600 * (1/3) = 200 movies in series.

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract this from the total:
600 - 200 = 400 movies remaining.

Step 3: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate this as:
400 * 0.4 = 160 older movies.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, we can calculate this as:
200 * 6 = $1200.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate this as:
160 * 5 = $800.

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the remaining movies.
Since the remaining movies are normal movies, we can calculate this as:
400 * 10 = $4000.

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
We add up the costs of all the movies:
$1200 + $800 + $4000 = $5000.

The final answer is: $5000"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Total cost: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate the hiking speed as follows:
Driving speed = 50 miles per hour
Half of the driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Now, we know the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours) and their hiking speed (20 miles per hour). We can use the formula: distance = speed * time to find the distance.

Distance = 20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours
Distance = 30 miles

The Llesis family's vacation spot is 30 miles away from their starting point.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 * 5 = 15 berries. Ava collects 15 - 3 = 12 berries.

Emma jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so let's say Emma jumps on x enemies. Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies.

Emma's score is 10x (for the enemies) + 15 (for the berries) + 30 * (60 - 4) (for the time) = 10x + 15 + 30 * 56 = 10x + 15 + 1680 = 10x + 1695.

Ava's score is 10(x + 8) (for the enemies) + 12 (for the berries) + 30 * (60 - 4) (for the time) = 10x + 80 + 12 + 30 * 56 = 10x + 80 + 12 + 1680 = 10x + 772.

The difference between their scores is A - E = (10x + 772) - (10x + 1695) = -923.

The final answer is: -923"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2.

34 / 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the three usual days, they ride thrice a day, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 times.
On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 times.
The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 9 + 6 = 15 times.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish, but since you can't have a negative number of fish, we know that the 17 fish taken out must have included some orange fish. Let's assume that x orange fish were taken out. Then, the number of white fish taken out would be 17 - x.

Now, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's represent the number of white fish he has now as W. Since he had 4 white fish initially, the number of white fish he has now is W = 4 + (17 - x).

We know that the number of orange fish he has now is 3 - x. Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2W
3 - x = 2(4 + 17 - x)
3 - x = 2(21 - x)
3 - x = 42 - 2x
x = 39

So, 39 orange fish were taken out of the tank. Since the total number of fish taken out was 17, the number of white fish taken out is 17 - 39 = -22, but again, we can't have a negative number of fish. This means that the 17 fish taken out must have included some white fish as well.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 39 = -36 orange fish, which is still not possible. However, if we assume that 39 orange fish were taken out, then the number of white fish taken out would be 17 - 39 = -22, which is also not possible.

Let's try a different approach. If Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish after adding the new fish, then the number of white fish he has now is W = 3 + (17 - x). Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2W
3 + 17 - x = 2(4 + (17 - x))
20 - x = 2(21 - x)
20 - x = 42 - 2x
x = 22

So, 22 orange fish were taken out of the tank. Since the total number of fish taken out was 17, the number of white fish taken out is 17 - 22 = -5, which is still not possible.

Let's try again. If Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish after adding the new fish, then the number of white fish he has now is W = 3 + (17 - x). Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2W
3 + 17 - x = 2(4 + (17 - x))
20 - x = 2(21 - x)
20 - x = 42 - 2x
x = 22

However, we know that the total number of fish taken out is 17, and we can't have a negative number of fish. So, let's re-evaluate the situation.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week:

Fuel consumption per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumption per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Fuel consumption per week = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of fuel consumption per week:

Cost of fuel consumption per week = Fuel consumption per week * Price per gallon
Cost of fuel consumption per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Cost of fuel consumption per week = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

She spent 6 twenties, so she has 10 - 6 = 4 twenties left.

Carrie was given 140 quarters. She spent all of them.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she spent:
- 6 twenties = 6 * 20 = 120 dollars
- 140 quarters = 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars

Total amount spent = 120 + 35 = 155 dollars.

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's currently 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat the house up by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125.
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train becomes 125 + 13 = 138.
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to multiply the number of bottle caps he finds per day by the number of days in the month and then multiply that by the value of each bottle cap.

Number of bottle caps per day: 10
Number of days in the month: 30
Value of each bottle cap: $0.25

Total bottle caps collected in 30 days: 10 * 30 = 300
Total money made: 300 * $0.25 = $75

Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month."
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to break it down into two parts: her regular pay and her overtime pay.

Her regular pay for 8 hours of work is 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours of overtime, her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30. So, her overtime pay is 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total earnings for the day are $160 + $90 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total employees after 3 months = 260
Total amount paid = Total employees * Salary per employee
Total amount paid = 260 * $4000
Total amount paid = $1,040,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $1,040,000."
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time for each song.

""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, so we multiply its duration by 2: 
150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, which was $10. So, Sally's starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Sally also works 20 hours, so her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"

The total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to achieve a 30% ratio of stuffed goats to all her stuffed animals."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) per day for 14 days. 
Total hours played in the first 2 weeks = 0.5 * 14 = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours per day for 7 days.
Total hours played in the last week = 2 * 7 = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours

Since Kris needs to play 30 hours to earn the achievement, she still needs to play:
30 - 21 = 9 hours

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to find the distance between them. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car: 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 72 / 12 = 6 square inches.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed = 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount.

Initial amount of tea = 10 (remaining) + 38 (consumed) = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4.

Initial amount of tea in gallons = 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Dale initially had 100 candies and ordered 100 more, so he now has 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

He sold 150 candies, so he has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left.

To sell all of his candies, he needs to sell 200 - 50 = 150 more.

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 1 * 5 = 5 petals
- 1 * 6 = 6 petals
- 1 * 4 = 4 petals
- 1 * 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:
101 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

There were originally 35 marshmallows in the bag. After using 18 marshmallows, they have 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.

However, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so they have 17 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make 14 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2, since there are two kids.

14 S'mores / 2 kids = 7 S'mores per kid.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per game. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Jack played for 4/60 = 1/15 hours.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they played for 20/2 = 10 minutes, or 1/6 hours.

The friend who is significantly better plays for 1.5 times as long, so they played for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes, or 1/2 hour.

Now, let's add up the total time played: 
1/15 + 1/6 + 1/2 = (4 + 5 + 15) / 30 = 24/30 = 4/5 hours.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total cost is 4/5 * 25 cents = 20 cents.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

To convert the fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:
O = 10/3 ≈ 3.33

The final answer is 3.33."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 8 cars. Then, he gives away 16 cars to his mother, leaving him with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (amount from organizations) = $125,000 (amount from students)

Since there are 20 students, we can divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 students = $6,250 per student

The answer is 6,250."

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 
On the second day, she walked for half of 8 hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we need to convert the hours into minutes. 
1 hour = 60 minutes
8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.

During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find 1/2 of 70, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35.

So, 35 cars left the parking lot, leaving 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the payment per task.

Since John does 30 cycles a day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cycles in a week is:
30 cycles/day * 7 days = 210 cycles

Each cycle has 5 tasks, so the total number of tasks in a week is:
210 cycles * 5 tasks/cycle = 1050 tasks

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a week is:
1050 tasks * $1.20/task = $1260

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards that PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to know the total production for the first three weeks. 
Total production for the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production.
Production for the fourth week = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The production for the fourth week is 14,000 bars."

- The cost of the additional chandeliers is 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier.
- The cost of the additional pictures is 20 - 10 = 10 pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items. 
The cost of the additional items is 13 * $15.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (standard items) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00.

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the fact that the distance traveled by the kangaroos is the same as the distance traveled by the turtles. We can set up an equation using the speed of the kangaroo and the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108 hours

Now, we can find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 108 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 27 hours

However, since there are 4 turtles, we need to multiply the time by 4.

Time = 27 hours * 4
Time = 108 hours

But we can simplify this by using the fact that the speed of the turtles is half the speed of the kangaroo. Since the distance is the same, the time it takes for the turtles to travel across the highway will be 4 times the time it takes for one turtle to travel the same distance.

Time = 4 * Time for one turtle
Time = 4 * (18 hours / 3)
Time = 4 * 6 hours
Time = 24 hours

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many clay dishes each person made and then add them together.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

We also know that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. 

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as 'x'. We know that the total amount she needs to buy the laptop is $50, so we can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:
x + 230 = 450

Now, subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices Adam has, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the current 3 cows produce.

3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

Since the farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce the remaining amount.

25 liters (target) - 15 liters (current) = 10 liters

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount each cow produces:

10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm): 
(5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm): 
(1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm): 
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts of the glue sticks to find the total length of the used glue sticks:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we subtract the total length of the used glue sticks from the original length of the glue sticks:
12 mm - 20 mm = -8 mm

However, since we can't have a negative length, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The question asks for the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, but it's possible that the glue sticks are not completely used. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm): 
(5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm): 
(1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm): 
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts of the glue sticks to find the total length of the used glue sticks:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

Since the glue sticks are partially used, we can't simply subtract the total length of the used glue sticks from the original length. Instead, we need to subtract the total length of the used glue sticks from the original length of the glue sticks and then subtract the remaining length of each glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the remaining length, we multiply 1/6 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm): 
(1/6) * 12 = 2 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the remaining length, we multiply 2/3 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm): 
(2/3) * 12 = 8 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the remaining length, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm): 
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the remaining lengths of the glue sticks to find the total length of the unused glue sticks:
2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. 
Total amount Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

The total cost of the items he wants to buy = $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost of the items:
$10800 - $5200 = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount of money he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He spent $2 on each of the 6 squirt guns, so the total amount spent on squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also spent $3 on each of the 3 packs of water balloons, so the total amount spent on water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2. 
60 / 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.
30 * 2 = 60 socks

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. To find the total number of socks, we add 60 + 30 = 90 socks.

To find the total number of dishes, we already know that Jack has 60 dishes. Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2.
60 / 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we know that Peter has 30 dishes and Jack has 60 dishes. To find the total number of dishes, we add 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5

Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To find the total number of goats left in the two farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. You are 3 years younger than your brother.
2. You are 2 years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of your ages is 87.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. Then, your brother's age is x + 3, and your sister's age is x - 2.

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so it is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, we can write the equation based on the sum of your ages: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After the heavy rain, the amount doubles, so on the second day, the amount of water passing through the river is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected.

Day 2: 10 people infect 6 others each, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Total infected = 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 3: 70 people infect 6 others each, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. Total infected = 70 (previous) + 420 (new) = 490.

Therefore, after three days, 490 people are infected.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she initially bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 x 2 = 6 oranges were given to the daughters.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
Total oranges given away = 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find out how many slices Paige baked, we need to calculate the total number of hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) 
Total coins = 110

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has.

Let's say Fawn has x books.
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total number of cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the jello. We know that each box costs $1.25.

"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens. 

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he will make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much Isaias paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to sell the chickens for by the number of chickens:

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each.

The final answer is: $61.11"

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x. We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob. So, the speed of the whirligig is:

Speed of whirligig = 5x
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily goods. We can subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total to find the cost of the carrots. 

$11 (total) - $6 (salad) - $3 (yogurt) = $2

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day. To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2.

$2 / 2 = $1

The final answer is 1."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

$10 (original hourly wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new hourly wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 (new hourly wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

Mark makes $480 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is 3x + 5x + x = 9x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + (3 * 6) + (5 * 6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find John's profit, we need to calculate his total monthly income and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate his total monthly income:
Number of rentals per month: 10
Hours per rental: 3
Total hours per month: 10 * 3 = 30 hours
Hourly wage: $25
Total monthly income: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
Car payment: $500
Total monthly income: $750
Profit: $750 - $500 = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

Martha's notebooks = 3 * Joseph's notebooks
7 = 3 * Joseph's notebooks
Joseph's notebooks = 7 / 3
Joseph's notebooks = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't have a fraction of a notebook)

Now, we know Joseph had 2 notebooks initially. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has:
Martha's notebooks = 7 (initial) + 5 (additional) = 12

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:
12 (Martha's notebooks) - 2 (Joseph's notebooks) = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis's distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance as follows:
Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis's distance = 50 + 10
Anis's distance = 60

Now, we can calculate the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles."
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, Denise's total is 10 + 18 = 28 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, and there are four adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), he has 4 bowls of soup. 

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner. Calvin, his wife, and their two children will eat 3 bowls for dinner. 

So, 4 bowls - 3 bowls = 1 bowl of soup left for lunch.

Since there are two children, we can divide the remaining 1 bowl by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 

1 bowl / 2 children = 0.5 bowls per child.

Since you can't have half a bowl, we can round down to 0 bowls per child, as they won't be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

Final answer: 0"
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

= 40 yards

For large masks:
Number of large masks = 8
Material needed for large masks = Number of large masks * Material needed per large mask
= 8 * 2.25 yards
= 18 yards

Total material needed = Material needed for small masks + Material needed for large masks
= 40 yards + 18 yards
= 58 yards

"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Total amount spent = $216
Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 visits per movie = 27 tickets

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night, so in a day, he sleeps for 10 hours * 2 (for two days) = 20 hours.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Now, let's subtract the total hours he spends on these activities from the total hours in a day: 
24 (total hours in a day) - 20 (sleeping hours) - 8 (working hours) - 1 (walking hours) = 24 - 29 = -5

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie, which is (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

So, the total number of marbles Dean gave away is 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the initial number of marbles Dean had: 30 - 16 = 14.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Now, we can substitute D = 60 into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, we can solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the size of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

"To find the total time John spends on sudoku, we need to calculate the time for both normal and extreme sudoku.

Time for normal sudoku: 45 minutes
Time for extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Total time spent on sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks.

Number of bottles of water: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

Since you can't drink half a bottle of water, we can round down to 7 bottles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2 * 20 (pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons) + 3 * x (pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons) = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3x = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 6

This means that Benny threw 6 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. Since there are 20 red balloons, the number of yellow balloons can be found by subtracting the number of red balloons from the total number of balloons. However, we don't know the total number of balloons. We can set up another equation to represent the situation:

20 (red balloons) + x (yellow balloons) = total number of balloons

We know that Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, and we know that 2 pieces of bologna were thrown at each red balloon. So, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. The remaining pieces of bologna were thrown at yellow balloons, which we know is 18. Since 3 pieces of bologna were thrown at each yellow balloon, the total number of yellow balloons can be found by dividing the remaining pieces of bologna by 3:

18 / 3 = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons.

The total number of balloons is 20 (red) + 6 (yellow) = 26.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total number of miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours worked by Bruce in the three days, we need to calculate the hours worked each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked each day: 
5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent.

The cost of the cake is $11.
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Total amount spent = $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

$31 / 2 = $15.50.

Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50."
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

The total number of students playing sports is 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18 students.

There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38 students.

Now, we add the total number of students playing sports: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

Total number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

1. Cats: 3
2. Dogs: 3 times the number of cats, so 3 * 3 = 9 dogs
3. Rabbits: 2 fewer than dogs, so 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits
4. Fish: 3 times the number of rabbits, so 3 * 7 = 21 fish
5. Gerbils: 1/3 the number of fish, so 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person eats per day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 60.

60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours. 

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we divide 8 hours by 4 hours to get 2 trips. 

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 trips. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips. 

To find the number of berries per trip, we divide 24 berries by 2 trips, which equals 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the tank initially.
Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons of water.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water used from the tank in 6 days.
The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, in 6 days, the amount of water used will be 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days.
The initial amount of water in the tank was 5000 gallons. After 6 days, 3000 gallons were used. So, the remaining amount of water in the tank will be 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the tickets from the total money Colby has left. 

13 * $10 = $130

$134 - $130 = $4

Colby has $4 left. Since tickets for any other day cost $7, he can buy 4 / $7 = 0.57 (round down to 0 since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket) or 0 tickets on other days.

In total, Colby can see 13 movies.

Final answer: 13"
"To find the total calories of the mini pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, which is 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories from all the pastries Andrew baked are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to first find the total number of Junebugs removed.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days:
300 / 5 = 60

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

To find the difference, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31

- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys she already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Total toys she already had: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to create equations. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

From the information given, we have the following equations:

1. A = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)
2. P = A + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)
3. P + A + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years)

We can substitute equation 1 into equation 2 to get:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute P = 2J + 10 into equation 3:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 from equation 1:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age using equation 1:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age using equation 2:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons (10) to the additional balloons (15): 10 + 15 = 25.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 25.

"To find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total, we need to add the number of boxes donated by the 10 people and the number of boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

However, they already have 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine which machine Fern should buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will make:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total amount of money the Widgeteer 3000 can make in a month is:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will make:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total amount of money the WidgetMaster 9000 can make in a month is:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the amount made by the WidgetMaster 9000 from the amount made by the Widgeteer 3000:

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay = 75 + 84
Total hay = 159 pounds

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs. 

The original price of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the price James paid for the CDs is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling them is 5 * $40 = $200.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, we can set up the following equations:

Let's say Dinar scored x points.
Azibo scored x + 10 points.
Bahati scored x + 20 points.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 5

8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours, which is equal to 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since Vince staples 30 reports per set, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so she woke up at 11:55 p.m.

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 11:55 p.m. and woke up at 2:38 a.m. The time she was asleep is 2:38 a.m. - 11:55 p.m. = 2 hours 43 minutes.

However, we also need to account for the time she was sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

Now, let's add the time she was asleep and the time she was sleepwalking. 2 hours 43 minutes + 23 minutes = 3 hours 6 minutes.

Now, let's convert 3 hours 6 minutes to minutes. 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Adding 6 minutes, we get 180 + 6 = 186 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time she woke up early from the total time. 186 minutes - 5 minutes = 181 minutes.

Jonathan initially had 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan also has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = 34 utensils.

"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, initially, 200 beds are occupied.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds will increase by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted will be 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000 beds, so the number of unoccupied beds will be 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information step by step.

1. Total emails sent per day: 16
2. Work emails: 7
3. Remainder after subtracting work emails: 16 - 7 = 9
4. Emails to family: 2/3 of the remainder: 2/3 * 9 = 6
5. Emails to boyfriend: 1/3 of the remainder: 1/3 * 9 = 3

Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find Aliya's age, which is given as 3 years. 

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is approximately 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. 

Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2 * 1 = 2 balls.

Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day, but 2 of those holes were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.
4. The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.
6. Since the pirates had already dug 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add these amounts together: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'A', the number caught by Stan as 'S', and the number caught by Alex as 'X'. 

We know that:
1. X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
2. S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)
3. X + S + A = 339 (Together they have caught 339 Pokémon)

We can substitute the value of X from equation 1 into equation 3:
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 2 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200 minutes

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is traveling in a southerly direction for the first leg and then a northerly direction for the second leg, and finally a southerly direction for the third leg, we need to subtract the distance covered in the second leg from the sum of the first and third legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members: 
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."

Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so we need to add 7 to Carlton's team size. 

Carlton's team has 13 players, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the garden. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given length = 15 feet and width = 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box. 

12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the initial number of boxes: 
240 - 4 = 236 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 236 = 59 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges:
236 - 59 = 177 oranges

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in India and the USA.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's assume the number of states in the USA is 'x'. Then, the number of states in India would be (x + 4).

Since the USA has 50 states, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = (1/2) * 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 4 = 25

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

x = 21

So, the USA has 50 states.

Now, we know the number of states in India is (x + 4) = (21 + 4) = 25.

The total number of states in both countries is 50 (USA) + 25 (India) = 75.

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's share by subtracting 10 from Robert's share.

Richard's share = Robert's share - 10
Richard's share = 30 - 10
Richard's share = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries.

Jerry's share = Total cherries - Richard's share
Jerry's share = 60 - 20
Jerry's share = 40

Now that we know Jerry has 40 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting Jerry's share from Robert's share.

Difference = Robert's share - Jerry's share
Difference = 30 - 40
Difference = -10

Since the difference is negative, it means Robert has fewer cherries than Jerry."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
Apple pie: 11 boxes * $15 = $165

Total earnings for Saturday: $60 + $165 = $225

Total earnings for Sunday: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
Total earnings for Sunday: $90 + $165 = $255

Total earnings for two days: $225 + $255 = $480

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."

On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each flower plus the space between them.

The length of the flower bed is 111 feet, which is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant, we can fit 1332 / 18 = 74.67 flowers in the bed. However, since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 74 flowers.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we can calculate how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$2,000 (monthly income) - $500 (monthly savings) = $1,500 (monthly expenses)

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can divide her monthly expenses by the cost of a pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy in a month.

$1,500 (monthly expenses) / $1,000 (cost of a pair of shoes) = 1.5 pairs per month

To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy in a month by 12.

1.5 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 18 pairs/year

Jessica can buy 18 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the time it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp is also 10 minutes.

Now, to peel 90 shrimp, it would take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes, since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute.

So, the total time it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 10 minutes (to saute) + 15 minutes (to peel) = 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours. So, the room cooled 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours. So, the room cooled an additional 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

After that, it was turned off for 2 hours. The room would warm up at 2 degrees an hour, so it warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the total change in temperature. The room started at some unknown temperature, then cooled 6 degrees, then cooled an additional 12 degrees, and finally warmed up 4 degrees. 

So, the total change in temperature is 6 - 12 + 4 = -2 degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 75 - 30 = 45 years.

Now, Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since 45 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, and Bill saw the comet for the second time 45 years after his dad saw it, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill was born as 45 + 30 = 75 years.

Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and 75 years have passed since he was born, we can calculate Bill's age when he was born as 90 - 75 = 15 years.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. 

Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, it makes 0.75x flights to Greece. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the first plane makes 0.25x flights to France and 0.25x flights to Germany.

The second plane makes 44 trips exclusively to Poland.

We know that the total number of flights made by the first plane is equal to the sum of flights to Greece, France, and Germany. Since the second plane's flights are not relevant to the first plane's flights, we can ignore it for now.

We are given that the 44 trips of the second plane are half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, we can set up the equation:

44 = 0.5x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

88 = x

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

Number of flights to France = 0.25x
= 0.25 * 88
= 22

"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings. 

$30 (total cost) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."

2. Let's denote the age of Helene as H and the age of Wilfred as W. We know that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4.

3. Since Helene is twice the average age of the group, we can write the equation: H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4).

4. We also know that the total age of the children is 20. So, we can write another equation: 3 + 4 + H + W = 20.

5. Now we have two equations:
   a) H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4)
   b) 3 + 4 + H + W = 20

6. We can simplify equation a) to H = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 2, since H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4) can be simplified to H = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 2.

7. Now we can substitute the value of H from equation b) into equation a): 
   (3 + 4 + H + W) / 2 = H
   7 + H + W = 2H
   7 + W = H

8. Now we can substitute the value of H from equation b) into the equation 7 + W = H:
   7 + W = 7
   W = 0

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on the total amount collected, not just Walter's contributions.

However, the problem states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount collected so far.

Since Walter's friend is going to give him $200, we can assume that the total amount collected will be $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as the total amount collected, which is $2200. So, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2200 = $6600.

The final answer is: $6600"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by 15 to find the number of people in the church. 

750 / 15 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 family members, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

The total number of slices would be x + 2x = 3x.

Since the family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 3x = 6 (2 adults + 4 kids).

Now, we know that the total number of slices is 6. We can set up an equation to find the value of x: 3x = 6.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 2.

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Since each adult gets a slice, and there are 2 adults, each adult gets 4/6 = 2/3 of the total slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can multiply the fraction by 100: (2/3) * 100 = 66.67%.

The final answer is 66.67."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours (total available) - 8 hours (total spent) = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can divide 64 by 8 to find the number of chocolate bars in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 * 3 = $45.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $45. The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is the total monthly cost minus the total monthly cost, which is $480.

480"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines: 50 + 1440 = 1490.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10480 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed.

Total gallons = 10480 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61980 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = Total gallons * 0.10
Cost = 61980 * 0.10
Cost = 6198

Matteo traveled 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy traveled 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 years old (375) and under 16 years old (750). To find the total number of male students, we add these two numbers: 375 + 750 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we subtract the total number of male students from the total number of students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
34% = 100% - x
x = 100% - 34%
x = 66%

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 66%.

"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25, but since he can't spend a negative amount, this means he has spent more than he has. However, we can assume he has spent all the money he had, so we will proceed with the calculation.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on other fruits: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = $-0.25, but since he can't spend a negative amount, we will assume he has spent all the money he had.

Since Jamaar has spent all his money, he can't buy any plums."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many sweets were given to her friends: 900 - 120 = 780.

Since Anne gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the remaining sweets by 10: 780 / 10 = 78.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each type of album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfies.

3 x 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portraits.

2 x 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals as L and the number of small stuffed animals as S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(Price of large stuffed animal) * (Number of large stuffed animals) + (Price of small stuffed animal) * (Number of small stuffed animals) = Total amount earned
$12L + $4S = $120

Substituting S = 2L into the equation:
$12L + $4(2L) = $120
$12L + $8L = $120
$20L = $120

Dividing both sides by $20:
L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:
S = 2 * 6
S = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Total earnings = $15 * 3
Total earnings = $45

Next, let's calculate her total expenses:
Total expenses = Daily expenses * Number of days
Total expenses = $3 * 3
Total expenses = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings (total earnings - total expenses):
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Finally, let's calculate her hourly wage:
Hourly wage = Net earnings / Total hours worked
Hourly wage = $36 / 18
Hourly wage = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of apples, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box. 

Two boxes of apples will have 2 * 40 = 80 apples.

Since each pack has 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

Final answer: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school:
Total amount of money lost = Number of years in school * Annual income before college
Total amount of money lost = 4 years * $25,000 per year
Total amount of money lost = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating:
Total amount of money earned = Number of years in school * Annual income after college
Total amount of money earned = 4 years * $75,000 per year (since his income tripled)
Total amount of money earned = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to repay the loans and cover the lost income:
Total amount of money needed = Total amount of money lost + Total amount of money earned
Total amount of money needed = $100,000 + $300,000
Total amount of money needed = $400,000

Since Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year, we need to calculate how many years it will take him to repay the loans:
Number of years to repay loans = Total amount of money needed / Annual loan amount
Number of years to repay loans = $400,000 / $50,000 per year
Number of years to repay loans = 8 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length * Width
Area = 8 * 10
Area = 80 square feet

So, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

80"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country, and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America: 26
Number of cities in each country: 5

Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier: 
52 inches (Cole's height) - 51 inches (Xavier's height) = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as 'x'. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The sum of the amounts taken by all three people is $1920. 

We can write the equation as: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again: 
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides: 
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 420

So, the first person took $420.

420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, we need to find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days.

3/8 = 0.375 (as a decimal)
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:

Hours worked by each painter = 7.875 / 4 = 1.96875 hours

The final answer is 1.96875."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people on the train at each stop.

Initially, there were 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train, so the total number of people became 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people boarded the train. So, the total number of people became 140 + 100 = 240.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people became 240 - 80 = 160.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160.

"To find the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile:

200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 * 120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192. 

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304.

"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from Becky's total. 

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate by multiplying Jake's slices by 2.

Silvia's slices = Jake's slices * 2
Silvia's slices = 7 * 2
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia.

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

A dozen roses costs $15, and she bought 15 roses. Since 15 is more than a dozen, we need to calculate the cost of 12 roses and then add the cost of 3 additional roses.

The cost of 12 roses is $15. The cost of 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny has 5 dollars. To find out how much change she needs, we subtract the cost from the amount she has: $5 - $21 = -$16. Since she can't have a negative amount, this means she doesn't have enough money to buy the roses. However, we can still calculate the change she would have if she had enough money.

If she had enough money, the change would be $21 - $5 = $16. Since she can only get quarters for change, we need to divide $16 by $0.25 (the value of a quarter) to find out how many quarters she would get: $16 / $0.25 = 64 quarters.

However, since she doesn't have enough money, she will leave with 0 quarters."

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time from the first train's arrival to its departure is 20 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time from the second train's arrival to its departure is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after its arrival, so its departure time is the same as its arrival time, 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 80 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:
- Waiting for the first train: 10 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 30 minutes (since it arrives after the first train leaves)
- Waiting for the third train: 60 minutes (since it arrives after the second train leaves)
- Waiting for the fourth train: 80 minutes (since it arrives after the third train leaves)

Total waiting time = 10 + 30 + 60 + 80 = 180 minutes.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far from the total number of toothpicks required. 

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks at the same rate. 

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks she needs for her sculpture.

"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can calculate the selling price:

Selling price = Original price * 1.20
Selling price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Selling price = $3200

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Selling price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

Since we are looking for the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount percentage = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Discount percentage = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Discount percentage = -20%

The negative sign indicates that the friend actually paid more than the original price, not obtained a discount."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many jellyfish a single spring creates in 1 hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and every second a jellyfish is created, we can calculate the number of jellyfish created in 1 hour as follows:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds/hour
Since a jellyfish is created every second, the number of jellyfish created in 1 hour is 3600.

Now, we need to find out how many jellyfish a single spring creates in 4 hours:

3600 seconds/hour * 4 hours = 14400 jellyfish

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, we multiply the number of jellyfish created by 5:

14400 jellyfish * 5 = 72000 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Final answer: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Now, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), we can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since James walked to the store and back, we need to add the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home:

Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store and back.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, let's find out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually. The amount saved would be the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry will get x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply the price of each type by the number sold.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
Since the rest of the bikes were MTB, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB) = $11,250
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

He attends 5 days a week, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per week is:
5 days * 40 minutes/day = 200 minutes

Since he also spends extra time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the extra minutes he spends on these days. 
1/16 of his weekly minutes is spent on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 7 days in a week. 
So, the total minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday is:
(1/16) * 7 days = 7/16 days
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 7/16 days to minutes:
(7/16) * 60 minutes = 26.25 minutes

Now, we can add the minutes he spends in class and the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday:
200 minutes + 26.25 minutes = 226.25 minutes

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
226.25 minutes / 60 = 3.75 hours

The final answer is: 3.75"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of 'x', the amount they ate is x/2.

We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2 = 540.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the T-Rex ate 540/2 = 270 kilograms.

To find the initial amount, we add the amount the T-Rex ate to the amount left after the T-Rex ate: 540 + 270 = 810.

The final answer is: 810"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda, we need to consider the number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas remaining.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. After taking 1 unshaken soda, there were 2 shaken sodas left. Then, Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 1 shaken soda. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left out of a total of 12 sodas (initial 12 - 3 shaken + 1 unshaken taken by Ellen - 1 shaken taken by her brother = 9 sodas). 

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas remaining, which is 1/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/9) * 100 = 11.11%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

The total distance between the two trains is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to calculate the total number of days he is available to work. 

March has 31 days, and he takes 20% of those days off. 20% of 31 is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days off. 

So, Billy is available to work 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he is available to work by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this total time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5.

1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
$15.00 (returned item) - $85.00 (initial charge) = -$70.00 (credit)
$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $58.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - (x/5) = (4/5)*x.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6*15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. We can calculate Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8

"To determine how many years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate her annual savings. 

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Lauren wants to save for 20 years. To find out how much she needs to save, we multiply her annual savings by the number of years: $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Now, we need to find out how many years she needs to work to save $1,200,000. To do this, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings: $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years.

However, since Lauren already has 20 years of savings, we need to subtract the 20 years from the total number of years she needs to work to save the required amount. Therefore, she needs to work 0 years more.

"To find the total population of the school, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total population of the school is x. Since 40% of the school population is made up of boys, we can set up the equation:

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Since the question asks for the number of girls, we need to find 60% of the total population (100% - 40% = 60%). We can calculate this as follows:
60% of 600 = 0.6 * 600
= 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we need to first calculate the total number of days in June, which is 30 days. 

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can divide the total miles by the number of days to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day: 
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day:
310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day.

So, Soledad must hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

After buying:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's compare the number of male and female fish:
- Male fish: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfish) = 11
- Female fish: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfish) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fish is: 16 - 11 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by 2 (since he visits his parents twice a month).

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since he visits his parents twice a month, the total distance he drives in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, she will walk a total of 10 * 7 = 70 miles in 7 days.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the total distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk. 

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

35"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the 5th worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs: 
15 pounds (Elijah's first dog) + 30 pounds (Elijah's second dog) = 45 pounds.
Adding Kory's dog to the total: 45 pounds + 60 pounds = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds.

Final answer: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Luis had 32 stickers. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly to reach half of the way around the earth, we need to divide the circumference of the earth by 2.

Distance = Circumference / 2
Distance = 40,000 / 2
Distance = 20,000 kilometers

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day.

Number of days = Total distance / Distance flown per day
Number of days = 20,000 / 400
Number of days = 50

The answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.
3. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so the speed of the faster car is 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. Since two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation: 
14 = 2 * Vince's age
Vince's age = 14 / 2
Vince's age = 7

So, Vince is 7 years old now.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know A = M = 9

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box and then multiply by the weight of each box.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons, which is 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights:
Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

Final answer: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length of the tree) / 4 feet (length of each log) = 20 logs

Since John cuts 5 planks from each log, we need to multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

20 logs * 5 planks/log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2/plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk. 

Since she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks 3 miles in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2 miles (beach) + 1 mile (sidewalk) = 3 miles (total)

We know that she walks 40 minutes on the beach. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, let's assume her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

The time it takes her to walk 2 miles on the beach is 40 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

2x * 40 = 2 miles
x = 1 mile per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

2x = 2 * 1 = 2 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / 2 miles per minute
Time = 0.5 minutes

Now, we can find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 3-mile walk:

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 0.5 minutes
Total time = 40.5 minutes

The final answer is: 40.5"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has already saved. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save ($60) to find out how much more she needs to save. 
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount.
$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he originally had, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob originally had 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of water Donny has after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug.

Donny starts with 2 mugs of water. Since we don't know the temperature of the second mug, let's represent it as 'x'. 

The total amount of water Donny has after pouring is 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug. 

So, the total amount of water Donny has is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces.

Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the remaining water must be at least 40 degrees. 

We know that the 33-degree mug contributed 4 ounces to the total amount of water. Let's calculate the amount of water from the 33-degree mug that Donny can drink.

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, and Donny can drink the water, the amount of water from the 33-degree mug that he can drink is 5 - 1 = 4 ounces.

Now, we know that 4 ounces of the 33-degree water can be mixed with 1 ounce of the unknown temperature water to make the total amount of water 5 ounces. 

Since the 33-degree water is 33 degrees, we can set up an equation to find the temperature of the unknown water:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees) + (1 ounce * x degrees) = 5 ounces * 40 degrees

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

So, the temperature of the second bottle is at least 68 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he received 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate.

18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days, we add the eggs from the first 30 days and the next 30 days: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 / 12 = 20.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:
Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, so the total cost is 100 * 5 = $500.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks.

The total amount he earns from selling 60 rocks is 60 * 7 = $420.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he loses:
The amount of money he loses is the difference between the total cost and the total amount he earns: 500 - 420 = $80.

Therefore, Adam loses $80.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected.

Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find out how many Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27. 

Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can find out how many Carrey collected by dividing 22 by 2.

Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, we know that Jim collected 27, Carlos collected 22, and Carrey collected 11 seashells.

To find out how many seashells they gathered in total, we add the number of seashells each person collected: 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand.

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to find the difference between the total demand and the current production.

460 (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = 3740

However, this is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. To find the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand, we need to divide the difference by the current production.

3740 / 4200 = 0.89

Since Hortex can't produce a fraction of a bottle, we round up to the nearest whole number.

0.89 ≈ 1

So, Hortex needs to produce approximately 1 more bottle to meet the total demand.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Since Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, that means 3/4 of 8 babies are wearing purple. 
3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple.

Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, we need to find 1/3 of 6.
1/3 * 6 = 2 babies are wearing both purple and bows.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. Since 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows, and 2 babies are wearing both purple and bows, we can assume that the remaining 1/3 of the purple wearers do not wear bows. 
So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (wearing both) + 1/3 * 6 (wearing only purple) = 2 + 2 = 4 babies.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 
Probability = (Number of babies wearing both purple and bows) / (Total number of babies wearing bows) 
Probability = 2 / 4 = 0.5 or 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on all days = 5168

Total reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on all days - (Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Total reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Total reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Total reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 * $3 = $60.

Abraham received $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13. 

Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person finds and subtract that from the total number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = 3120 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so he makes 3120 * $0.40 = $1248 per week.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year.

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in the first 8 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 = 52500

Adding the 1000 fruits produced in the 10th year, the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years is:
52500 + 1000 = 53000

The final answer is: 53000"

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation: B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation: R = 4B.

Now, we are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get: Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6Y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6Y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(5) = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave 1/5 of her money to her sister. 

To find out how much money Rissa gave to her sister, we can calculate 1/5 of $15, which is 15/5 = $3.

Now, we know that Rissa gave $3 to her sister, so she is left with 15 - 3 = $12.

The question asks for the amount of money left in Ronnie's money, but the problem doesn't mention Ronnie giving any money to her sister. Therefore, Ronnie still has the $5 she was given initially.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each color as x. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, we can set up the equation:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + x (yellow) = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Since x represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day: 
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find the number of cycles, we first need to find the number of pods in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of pods in the new box = 100 + (20% of 100)
= 100 + (0.20 * 100)
= 100 + 20
= 120 pods

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1. Since each cycle requires 1 pod, we can divide $1 by the cost of one pod:

Cost of one pod = $12 / 100 = $0.12
Number of cycles = $1 / $0.12
= 8.33 cycles

Since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we'll round down to 8 cycles.

Final answer: 8"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills and is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 of 8, which is 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches of chalk, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. This means he used 2.25 inches of the 5-inch piece of chalk.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of the remaining chalk will be used each day. 

20% of 2.25 inches = 0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45 inches

Since the teacher has already used 2.25 inches, the remaining chalk is 0 inches. We can set up the equation:

0.45x = 0

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.45:

x = 0 / 0.45
x = 0

However, this doesn't make sense, as the teacher can't use 0 inches of chalk. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday, and he has 2.25 inches left. Since he uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can set up the equation:

2.25 = 0.20 * (x - 1)

This is because the teacher used 2.25 inches on Monday, so we subtract 1 day from 'x' to account for the first day.

Now, we can solve for 'x':

2.25 = 0.20 * (x - 1)
2.25 / 0.20 = x - 1
11.25 = x - 1
x = 12.25

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The teacher will have 12 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

Since Mr. Marcellus is returning 1600 gallons of milk, we need to calculate the total cost of these gallons.

Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost of 1600 gallons = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total with $27,000.

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide $27,000 by $500 to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy:

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets by 100 to find the total number of books:

54 sets × 100 books/set = 5400 books

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books Bob can buy per school:

5400 books ÷ 3 schools = 1800 books per school

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags, then multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
Number of bags = 850 kg / 50 kg
Number of bags = 17

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 17 * $18
Total cost = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is cut into and then divide that by the number of slices each friend eats.

For cheese pizza: 12 slices per pizza * 6 friends = 72 slices
For pepperoni pizza: 8 slices per pizza * 6 friends = 48 slices

Since each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, we can calculate the total number of slices each friend eats per pizza type as follows:
- Cheese pizza: 6 slices
- Pepperoni pizza: 4 slices

Now, we can calculate the total number of pizzas needed for each type:
- Cheese pizza: 72 slices / 6 slices per pizza = 12 pizzas
- Pepperoni pizza: 48 slices / 4 slices per pizza = 12 pizzas

Since Kate needs 12 pizzas of each type, she needs to buy 12 cheese pizzas and 12 pepperoni pizzas. Therefore, she needs to buy 12 + 12 = 24 pizzas in total.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to determine how old John was when Digimon was released. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim at that time, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release was x. Then, John's age at that time would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + (current age - x) = 28

Since we don't know the current age, let's assume the time passed since Digimon's release is y years. Then, John's current age would be 2x + y, and Jim's current age would be x + y.

However, we are given that John is 28 now, so we can rewrite the equation as:

2x + (28 - x) = 28
x + (28 - x) = 28

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 28 = 28
28 = 28

This means that the current age of Jim is not relevant to the problem. We can use the information that John is twice as old as Jim at the time of Digimon's release.

Since John is 28 now, we can find Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release by dividing John's current age by 2:

Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release = 28 / 2
Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release = 14

Now, we need to find the time that has passed since Digimon's release. Since John is 28 now, and he was 14 at the time of Digimon's release, the time that has passed is:

Time passed = John's current age - Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release
Time passed = 28 - 14
Time passed = 14

However, we are not asked for the time passed, but Jim's current age. We can find Jim's current age by adding the time passed to Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release:

Jim's current age = Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release + Time passed
Jim's current age = 14 + 14
Jim's current age = 28

However, this is not the correct answer. We are asked for Jim's age, not John's age. Since John is twice as old as Jim at the time of Digimon's release, we can set up the equation:

2x = 14
x = 7

Now, we can find Jim's current age by adding the time passed to Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release:

Jim's current age = Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release + Time passed
Jim's current age = 7 + 14
Jim's current age = 21

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages, and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week. 
Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus

4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red pens and black pens: 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of each bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60. Since the cognac costs 50% more per bottle, the cost of each bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the scotch is 10 * $60 = $600. The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: 1.67"
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as:

4x + 8 = 40

Now, we need to isolate 'x'. To do this, we'll subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x':

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had and then subtract the colors she used or lost.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors, so Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, the question asks for the height from the second floor's floor, which means we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor.

"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

Remaining shells = 700 - 280 = 420

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells

Now, we can find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.

Shells found by team Gogetters = 420 - 252 = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the total amount of exercise the dogs need per day, we can add up the exercise of the first three dogs: 
1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total, and the average is 3 miles per dog, we can divide the total exercise by 4 to find the average:
8 miles / 4 dogs = 2 miles per dog.

Since the first three dogs already have 8 miles, we can subtract this from the total average to find the exercise the last dog needs:
3 miles (average) - 8 miles (total) = -5 miles. However, since the last dog cannot have a negative amount of exercise, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know the average is 3 miles per dog, and the first three dogs have 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles. Since the average is 3 miles, we can set up an equation to find the total exercise the dogs need:
(1 + 4 + 3 + x) / 4 = 3, where x is the exercise the last dog needs.

Multiply both sides by 4:
1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12

Combine the constants:
8 + x = 12

Subtract 8 from both sides:
x = 4

The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day."
"To find out how much John had leftover after paying his debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the loan amount: 40% of $250,000 is 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000.
2. Calculate the amount used to pay off debts: 60% of $100,000 is 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000.
3. Calculate the amount leftover: $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

John had $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts."
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas: 
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 * 0.50 = $64.

Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 times the cost price. 

Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72

Selling price = 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters.

"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first calculate the total number of balloons they started with. 

They have 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, so the total number of balloons is 10 * 30 = 300.

Since 12 balloons are left, we subtract 12 from the total number of balloons to find out how many were thrown: 300 - 12 = 288.

Therefore, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons."
"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to first calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose.

For the first medicine, Saanvi uses 14 mL.
For the second medicine, she uses 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

So, in one dose, she uses 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:
56 * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate 1/8 of Ali's class capacity and then multiply it by 2 since John has two classes.

1/8 of Ali's class capacity = 1/8 * 120 = 15
John's class capacity = 15 * 2 = 30
Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school = 30 * 2 = 60

The combined capacity of both schools = Ali's class capacity + John's school capacity = 120 + 60 = 180

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the total amount Stephen needs to pay, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

The total amount Stephen needs to pay is the initial $300 plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

To find the amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers that need to be changed. Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers that need to be changed is 2 x 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the diapers. Half of 10 diapers is 10 / 2 = 5.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is calculated as length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 202.5 = 697.5.

The final answer is: 697.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. The bus had 20 people initially. 
2. 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, so the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. 
   So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station. 
   The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. 
   The number of passengers on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. 
   The remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

"Initially, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 5 years. The cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is 3 * 5 * 2 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. 

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year. The total cost for the next 3 years is 3 * 3 * 5 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 6 students will be left. 

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

The remaining 6 students will have to wait for the next group to finish. Since they can't try the escape room until the next group is done, the total time required will be the time for the 3 full groups plus the waiting time for the remaining 6 students.

The waiting time for the remaining 6 students is 45 minutes (since they can't try the escape room until the next group is done). 

So, the total time required is:
135 minutes (for the 3 full groups) + 45 minutes (waiting time for the remaining 6 students) = 180 minutes

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of 4 wooden tables at $20 each is 4 x $20 = $80.

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:

4x = 4(8) = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The basic manicure costs $35 and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost for both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since there's a 20% discount for getting both services, we calculate the discount as follows: 
20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, let's add the cost of nail art for each finger. There are 10 fingers (5 on each hand), and the cost of nail art per nail is $3. 
The total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30. 

The total cost for Karen would be $60 (for the manicure and pedicure) + $30 (for the nail art) = $90."
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings and that she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's total:

Shelley's paintings = Samantha's paintings + 12
Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can subtract 8 from Shelley's total:

Kim's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 8
Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initial price in November: $40
Price in December after 80% increase: 
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Price in January after 50% decrease from December:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and then add them together.

4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie will earn:
2 * ($80 - 25% of $80)
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, we can calculate the total hours traveled as follows:

3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. 

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

Percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms = (20 hours / 8 hours) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, we have the capacity of each shelf: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

The total capacity of the middle two shelves is 10 + 10 = 20 books. Adding the capacity of the top shelf, the total capacity is 20 + 15 = 35 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide 110 by 35 to find out how many sets of shelves she needs. 
110 / 35 = 3.142857 (approximately 3.14)

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 4 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions

Now, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:

70% of 110 questions = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions

Since she already got 60% of the first test correct, we can calculate the number of questions she got right on the first test:

60% of 70 questions = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions

Now, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to find out how many calls he needs to make to get 15 customers, we can divide 15 by 1 (since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls) and multiply by 25.

15 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 15 * 25 = 375 calls

However, we also know that for every 2 customers, 1 will buy a car. So, to find out how many customers Jason needs to get 15 sales, we can divide 15 by 1 (since 1 customer buys a car per 2 customers) and multiply by 2.

15 customers / 1 customer per 2 customers = 15 * 2 = 30 customers

Now, we know that Jason needs 30 customers to get 15 sales. Since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls, we can divide 30 by 1 (since he gets 1 customer per 25 calls) and multiply by 25.

30 customers / 1 customer per 25 calls = 30 * 25 = 750 calls

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 candles.

Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each of these takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
3. The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first side, so each of these takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.
4. Since there are 2 sides that take 2.5 minutes, the total time for these sides is 2.5 * 2 = 5 minutes.
5. The total time for all 6 sides is the sum of the time for each side: 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 30 minutes.

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

Since Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicles, and each box costs $2.00, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost.

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

The total cost for Bob to build his project will be $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, the cost of each additional phone is 2 * $20 = $40.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $40 = $160.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $160 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in June. Since June has 30 days, and he sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts per day * 30 days = 300 doughnuts

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, we can multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:

300 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $600

So, Derrick makes $600 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Cost of blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
Cost of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 = $16.00
Cost of skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00

Total cost: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Since Alicia's clothes need to be sent to the dry cleaners weekly for 5 weeks, we multiply the total cost by 5:

$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

The final answer is: $235."
"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first calculate his new speed in words per minute. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we can divide the total number of words by his new speed: 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

The answer is 12."
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.
On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so there were 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, we know the number of people on the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days (5) and add it to the total number of people on the first three days.

Total number of people on the first three days: 50 + 70 + 140 = 260
Total number of people for the rest of the week: 60 * 5 = 300
Total number of people for the rest of the week: 300
Total number of people for the week: 260 + 300 = 560

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 560."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 60 seconds is 20 + 60 = 80.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   So, in the next 30 seconds, 80 * 30 = 240 kernels pop.
   The total number of kernels popped in the first 90 seconds is 80 + 240 = 320.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   The rate of the past 30 seconds was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   So, in the final 30 seconds, 40 * 30 = 120 kernels pop.
   The total number of kernels popped in 120 seconds is 320 + 120 = 440.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   A quarter of 120 is 120 / 4 = 30 kernels.
   The total number of kernels popped is 440 + 30 = 470.

Garrett has 470 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total number of gallons of lemonade Tim will make. He will make 4 gallons of lemonade, and an extra gallon that is twice as tart, so the total number of gallons is 4 + 1 = 5 gallons.

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to calculate the total number of cups of lemon juice required. 5 gallons * 4 cups/gallon = 20 cups of lemon juice.

Now, we need to find out how many lemons are required for 20 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we divide 20 cups by 6 cups/lemon to get the total number of lemons needed. 20 cups / 6 cups/lemon = 3.33 lemons. Since we can't use a fraction of a lemon, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Tim will need 4 lemons.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Now, multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

The 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
The 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Total number of legs = 20 + 60 = 80 legs.

Now, to find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
Total number of pairs of legs = 80 / 2 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks. 

Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, there must be 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks.

Now, we know that the total number of blocks is 32. We have 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks, so the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - (Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks)
= 32 - (4 + 8)
= 32 - 12
= 20

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

Final answer: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years.

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

We know that the bag has 54 red candies. 
The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow) = 43

The number of pink candies in the bag is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel, we can simply multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights: 
$80 * 3 = $240

To find the cost of the bus trips, we need to calculate 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel:
10% of $80 = 0.1 * $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, we multiply the cost of one bus trip by the number of trips:
$8 * 7 = $56

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the bus trips to find the total cost:
$240 + $56 = $296

The final answer is: 296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 back to find the initial amount: 21 + 4 = 25.

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas initially had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received: 52 - 25 = 27.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then add them together.

The cost of the adult ticket is $12, and there is one adult, so the total cost for the adult ticket is $12.
The cost of the child ticket is $8, and there is one child, so the total cost for the child ticket is $8.
The cost of 2 popcorns is $3 each, so the total cost for the popcorns is $3 * 2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $12 (adult ticket) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $26.

The family pays a total of $26."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of the luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
- Original price of each T-shirt: $8
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16
- Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.
- The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4
- The price of the second T-shirt after the discount is $8 - $4 = $4
- The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12

For the shoes:
- Original price of the shoes: $40
- Jake buys the shoes at 40% off, so the discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16
- The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24

Josh is open 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). In 2 weeks, he is open 6 * 2 = 12 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 12 days, he services 3 * 12 = 36 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so for 36 cars, he makes 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, let's break down the events:

1. Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
2. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies
3. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
   - 4 sugar cookies (no change)
4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies
5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
   - 2 sugar cookies

Randy now has 6 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 sugar cookies.

6 oatmeal cookies + 7 chocolate chip cookies + 2 sugar cookies = 15 cookies"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get from each half of his collection and add them together.

Half of Matthew's collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 each), Matthew would earn 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 each), Matthew would earn 6 * $7 = $42.

The total amount Matthew would earn is $30 + $42 = $72.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many holes Nate needs to fill.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled per day is:
9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.

We are also told that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. Since we know that Igor gathered 24 items, the number of beakers he gathered is 29 - 24 = 5.

However, Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so Igor must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the second basket first. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total:
10 + 20 = 30

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30.

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so the distance Vanessa runs is 2 times the distance Aaron runs. Let's denote the distance Aaron runs as D. Then, Vanessa runs 2D.

We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, so 2D = 4. This means D = 2 miles.

We are also given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs D miles, his time is D/A = 2/16 = 1/8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60: (1/8) * 60 = 7.5 minutes.

Now, we know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so she runs 2D = 2 * 2 = 4 miles. Since Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed, her speed is V = A/2 = 1/4 of the total speed. 

Since Aaron's time is 7.5 minutes, Vanessa's time is 2 * 7.5 = 15 minutes.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line.

However, he already has 6 feet of line. So, we need to subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required. 

600 - 6 = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- 6 reservations per night * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals per night
- 12 meals per night * $5 per meal = $60 per night
- $60 per night + $5 per night (wine) = $65 per night

Since they are open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue would be:
- $65 per night * 2 nights = $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of the watermelons is $80. 

Since the vendor sold all the watermelons at a 25% profit, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Total cost + (Total cost * Profit percentage)
Selling price = $80 + ($80 * 0.25)
Selling price = $80 + $20
Selling price = $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then find the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18 years old. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference in the number of oranges they peel.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. 

In 1 hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.
Jane will peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

"To find the cost of the new radiator, Mark gets 80% off the original price of $400. 

80% of $400 is 0.8 * 400 = $320. 
So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Mark also hires a mechanic to install it for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 
The cost of installation is 3 * $50 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (radiator) + $150 (installation) = $230.

Final answer: $230"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation: 2c + 4b = 70.

Now we have two equations:

1) c + b = 20
2) 2c + 4b = 70

We can simplify equation (2) by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us: c + 2b = 35.

Now we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate 'c': (c + 2b) - (c + b) = 35 - 20, which simplifies to b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting b = 15 into equation (1): c + 15 = 20, which simplifies to c = 5.

Therefore, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

So, each person can have 14 slices.
