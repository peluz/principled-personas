"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fibers: 2 bolts
White fibers: Half of 2 bolts, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To calculate the increased value, we multiply the original price by 150% (or 1.5). 

$80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

The new value of the house is $120,000. 

Now, we need to subtract the amount Josh spent on repairs ($50,000) from the new value to find the profit.

$120,000 - $50,000 = $70,000

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

Final answer: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs per sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints per week.

Number of meters per sprint: 60 meters
Number of sprints per week: 3 times
Number of weeks per week: 1 week

Total meters per week = 60 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/week = 180 meters/week

The total number of meters James runs per week is 180 meters."
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given so far and subtract that from the total amount of feed she needs for the entire day.

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed Wendi has given so far:
- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups
Total feed given so far: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire day is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Now, let's subtract the total amount of feed given so far from the total amount of feed needed for the entire day:
60 cups (total needed) - 40 cups (given so far) = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal of the day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

The cost of 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is the cost of the first glass plus the cost of the remaining 15 glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so the time it takes to download 120 GB is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

However, the download is interrupted by a 20-minute restart. So, the total time taken to download 60% of the file is:
60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so the time it takes to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

The total time taken to download the entire file is the sum of the time taken to download the first 60% and the time taken to download the remaining 40%:
80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the 200 GB file.

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments.

1. The first 3 hours, John drives at 60 mph. Distance = speed * time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

2. He then spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. Distance = 0 miles.

3. After that, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = speed * time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

4. Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. Distance = speed * time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

Now, we add up the distances covered in each segment: 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

So, John is 315 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the point where the net profit is greater than $0. To do this, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

However, this calculation only accounts for the initial cost and does not take into account the fact that the tree will start producing lemons after the first year. 

So, we need to subtract 1 from the result to get the correct number of years:

12 years - 1 year = 11 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos 11 years for the lemon tree to start earning money.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2 - (x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

6x - 12 - x + 2 = 30

Combine like terms:

5x - 10 = 30

Add 10 to both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So Melanie started with 8 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling at the same time and in the same direction, they will cover the same distance.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward.

So, the total distance covered by each train is:
- Westward: 80 miles
- Northward: 150 miles

Total distance covered by each train = 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
- Hours worked per week: 35 hours
- Hourly wage: $20
- Annual hours worked: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual salary from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Her annual salary from coaching: 
- Hours worked per week: 15 hours
- Hourly wage: $30
- Annual hours worked: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual salary from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Total annual salary: $35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

"To find the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks would be 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, the total number of eggs she eats in 28 days would be 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

To convert this to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs). 

84 / 12 = 7

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

Final answer: 7"
"To find the total time Marissa has spent walking so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent walking so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend walking the entire 12-mile trail.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to complete the remaining 8 miles.

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 8 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 8 mph

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = (27 + 20)/3 = 47/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 47/3 - 1 = 44/3 liters.

To convert this to a decimal, we divide 44 by 3: 44/3 = 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: 14.67"
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age at that time: 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

- The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
- The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
- The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the price he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. We can write this as:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

So, the original price of the book was $26.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract that from the total distance of the trip.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. 

Before his second stop, Henry had traveled 20 miles (first stop) + 15 miles (distance to the second stop) = 35 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance before the second stop from the total distance to find the distance between the two stops: 
60 miles - 35 miles = 25 miles.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Since one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. 

Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: 
B - $5 = $99

To find the cost of the boots, we add $5 to both sides of the equation:
B = $99 + $5
B = $104

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person says 80 jelly beans.
The second person says 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60.
The third person says 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these three guesses. To do this, we add the guesses together and divide by 3.

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25
25% of 4 = 4 * 0.25 = 1
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5 points

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To find out how much money John has, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling his Lego sets and subtract the cost of the video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 each on 8 video games, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games. To find out how much he had initially, we need to add the money he spent on video games to the money he had left: $195 - $160 + $5 = $40.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he can buy with $40. Since each Lego set costs $15, we can divide $40 by $15 to find out how many sets he can buy: $40 / $15 = 2.67.

Since John can't buy a fraction of a Lego set, we round down to 2 sets.

John initially had 13 Lego sets and sold 13, so he still has 13 - 13 = 0 Lego sets.

The final answer is 0."
"To find John's average speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Distance run per day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours
- Day 4: 1.5 hours
- Day 5: 1.5 hours

Total distance run per week: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 9 miles

Since John runs 3 days a week, we can calculate his average speed as follows:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 9 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 3 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.

When Polly throws the javelin without the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet. 

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total calories available for consumption. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. So, the remaining calories available for consumption are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have left: 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 servings * 5 grams per serving = 4 grams.

Therefore, you can eat 4 grams of chips.

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of candles sold = 20
Price per candle = $2.00
Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Total cost:
Number of pounds of beeswax and wicks needed = 20 candles / 10 candles per pound
Number of pounds of beeswax and wicks needed = 2 pounds
Cost of supplies = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound
Cost of supplies = $20.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours spent on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, we add the hours spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used and the ones she had left.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she used or had is 80 + 23 = 103.

Now, to find the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased, we subtract the total number of Post-it notes she used or had from the initial number:

80 (initial) - 103 (used or had) = -23

However, this doesn't make sense, as we can't have a negative number of Post-it notes. This means that the problem statement is incorrect or incomplete.

But, if we consider the problem as 80 (initial) - 103 (used or had) = -23, we can say that the problem is actually asking for the difference between the number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and the total number of Post-it notes she used or had."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, which means it is 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie.
Cost of each red tie = $40 * 1.5
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"To find the total number of unoccupied units, we first need to find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove. 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
The total revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
The total revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
The total revenue for Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
The total revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
The total revenue for Friday is $480.

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since the question asks for the amount more that the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, Patchy had 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens.

"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2. 

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight limit of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees are $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, we add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

The number of good oranges is 17."

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the initial pension is $50,000, the value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

Now, we need to calculate 5% of $1,000,000, which is $1,000,000 * 0.05 = $50,000.

So, for the remaining 10 years, her annual pension will be $50,000 (initial pension) + $50,000 (5% of the value of the pension) = $100,000.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $100,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her the full amount of $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her 10% less money per month. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the amount charged per month for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she has already used (4 gallons) and then add the distance she has already traveled (100 miles).

First, let's calculate the remaining capacity of her tank:
12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons remaining

Now, let's calculate the total distance she can drive on a single tank:
8 gallons (remaining) * 25 miles per gallon (average miles per gallon) = 200 miles

However, since she has already traveled 100 miles, we need to add that to the total distance:
200 miles + 100 miles = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the hours spent on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

The total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and there are 4 schools. So, the total number of teams is 2 teams/school * 4 schools = 8 teams.

Each team has 5 players, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of players is 5 players/team * 8 teams = 40 players.

Each team has 1 coach, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of coaches is 1 coach/team * 8 teams = 8 coaches.

Now, we add the total number of players and coaches to find the total number of people sent by the schools. Total people = 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then add the interest.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is $3.

The total interest for 5 units is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay each month is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.

However, since this is an installment plan, the interest is spread over 3 months. So, the monthly payment will be $765 / 3 = $255.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Since the number of games won is x + 8, we can substitute x = 7 into this expression: 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683

"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn's record sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The cost of the gift bags is 9 * $2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add those amounts together.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults, so the total amount for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

A child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. There are 5 children, so the total amount for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amounts for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

The final answer is: 225"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets the three have: 
4 (Cindy's pets) + 6 (Marcia's pets) + 18 (Jan's pets) = 28

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children.

We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time is x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

This means Gerald's original time was 36 seconds.

Now, we know Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6

Adding this to his original time:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is: 39.6"
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference.

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide 16 ounces by 3 to find out how many cans she used. 

16 ounces / 3 = 5.33 (round down to 5 since we can't use a fraction of a can)

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes. 

5 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 15 tomatoes

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 5

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she already has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She is giving 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of potted plants she gave away from the total number of potted plants she already had: 80 - 40 = 40.

Therefore, Mary will have 40 potted plants left.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 

Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the time watched on the other days from the total time.

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 

1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can divide 90 minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes.

90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes

Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. 

Since Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can find the rate of feet per second: 
20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Now, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed:
64 seconds / 16 seconds per set = 4 sets.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we multiply the number of sets by 2:
4 sets * 2 liters per set = 8 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so we can write an equation: 
6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. We can write an equation:
B = 50D

Substituting the value of B we found earlier, we get:
300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 + ($10 * 0.5) = $15 each.
The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 + ($16 * 0.5) = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.

The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

Sasha's profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then calculate their current salaries.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)

To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can divide both sides by 1.3:
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769 (approximately)

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary:
Adrien's current salary = Adrien's old salary + 40% of Adrien's old salary
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + 0.4($40,000)
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's current salary = $56,000

Now, we can find their total salary four years later:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Julia bought a package of spoons, but the exact number is unknown. Let's call this number 'x'. 

Her husband also bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had initially is 'x + 5'.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons she had left after using 3 is 'x + 5 - 3' or 'x + 2'.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that 'x + 2' is equal to 12.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 12

To solve for 'x', we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 12 - 2
x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought initially contained 10 spoons.

Total time spent on patients per day = 500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients per day = 500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000
Total cost of doctors' time per day = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Profit per day = Total revenue from patients - Total cost of doctors' time
Profit per day = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

The hospital makes $70,000 in profit per day."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
   Since there are 60 elves initially, 
   1/3 of 60 is 20. 
   So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   10 elves quit from the 40 remaining, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
They both rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 * 2 * 6 = 24 tickets.

In total, they used 12 + 24 + 24 = 60 tickets.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
= 41 - 28
= 13

The final answer is 13."

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation:

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the total number of Scottish unicorns: 
   Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we multiply the total number of unicorns by 1/3.
   Total unicorns = 27
   Scottish unicorns = 27 * (1/3) = 9

2. Next, we find the number of female Scottish unicorns:
   Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.
   Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions completed.

To find out how many questions Mark completed in the second test, we multiply the rate by the time taken: 
5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions completed.

To find out the total number of questions completed, we add the questions completed in both tests: 
40 + 30 = 70 questions completed.

Since the first test had 75 questions and the second test had 100 questions, the total number of questions is 75 + 100 = 175. 

To find out the number of questions left incomplete, we subtract the total questions completed from the total number of questions:

The percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into the equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Now, to find the initial number of fries in the pack, we need to add the fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, the pigeons, the raccoon, and the ants to the remaining fries: 
48 (eaten) + 5 (remaining) = 53 fries.

However, we need to account for the fries eaten by the seagull, which is 7 fries. So, we subtract 7 from 53:

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to first determine the cost of each toy.

We know that one action figure costs $5. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

We also know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can set up an equation to find the cost of one red car: 
$15 = 3 * $4
$15 = $12
This means that the initial statement about the doll costing as much as 3 action figures and one red car is incorrect. The doll actually costs $12.

Now, we can calculate the total value of all the toys:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9 eggs

Number of babysitting jobs required = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write the equation (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature and then add them together.

Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs per spider = 640 legs
Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs per insect = 540 legs
Mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs per invertebrate = 30 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and we are not given the age of the fourth bird. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds. 

Since we are not given the age of the fourth bird, we can't calculate the total age. But based on the information given, we can assume the fourth bird is also Sally Two, as the problem states ""There are four birds at the Caboose."" 

If Sally Two is 19 years old, then the total age of the four birds would be 8 + 19 + 16 + 19 = 62.

"To calculate the total monthly payment, we need to first calculate 50% of the minimum payments and then add it to the minimum payments.

Minimum payments: $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

50% of the minimum payments: 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment: $1000 (minimum payments) + $500 (50% of minimum payments) = $1500

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes (converting 5 seconds to minutes) = 1.5833 minutes

Now, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the total number of potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes

Converting the result to a more understandable format, we get approximately 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of gallons * Number of glasses per gallon * Price per glass
Total revenue = Number of gallons * 20 * $0.50
Total revenue = Number of gallons * $10

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'x'. Then, the total revenue is $10x.

Total cost = Cost of lemons + Cost of sugar
Total cost = $3x + $2x
Total cost = $5x

Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up the equation:
$10x - $5x = $25
$5x = $25
x = 5

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can calculate the total cost of lemons:
Total cost of lemons = $3x
Total cost of lemons = $3 * 5
Total cost of lemons = $15

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crabs each person has.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 
Bo + Monic + Rani = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of students who voted (80) by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = 80 * (3/4) = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got can be found by subtracting the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

Number of votes the loser got = Total votes - Votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years.
   - Mark was 5 years older than that, so Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.
   - Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so Mark's current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.
3. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3, and then subtract that from 1.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (1, 2, and 3) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1 - 3/6 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll, and then the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also 3/6, since the probability of rolling an even number does not depend on the first roll.

So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4 = 0.25.

Now, we can find the difference in probability by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.25 * 100 = 25%

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

"To find the total number of straw pieces used for the rats, we need to subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used. 

First, let's calculate the total straw used for the hamsters: 
10 hamsters * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw

Next, let's calculate the total straw used for the rabbits: 
20 pieces of straw

Now, let's subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 
160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the remaining straw by 6 to find the number of rats: 
90 / 6 = 15

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the number of rats by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage: 
15 / 3 = 5

"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month, then multiply it by 3 since Mandy paid after 3 months.

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Total interest for 3 months = $2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Total amount = Principal + Total interest
Total amount = $100 + $6
Total amount = $106

"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total selling price. 

Total selling price = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total selling price = Number of bags * $30
Total selling price = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags, including transportation:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the cost of transportation:
Total cost = Total cost + Cost of transportation
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, let's find the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total selling price - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the number of bags the trader bought before the transportation cost. Let's recalculate the number of bags bought before transportation:
Let's assume the number of bags bought is x.
Total cost = Number of bags bought * Cost per bag
Total cost = x * $20
Total cost = $260 + $26
x * $20 = $286
x = $286 / $20
x = 14.3

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 14 bags.

Now, let's calculate the number of bags sold:
Number of bags sold = Number of bags bought - Number of bags left
Number of bags sold = 14 - 1
Number of bags sold = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food

Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They also spent $33 on 2 rides. Total cost = Cost of tickets and food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $33
Total cost = $69.00

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3 (the number of friends).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom plants and chops down each year, and then subtract the total number of trees that die after 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year and chops down 2 trees per year, so the net gain of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees. After 10 years, he has planted 10 * 10 = 100 new trees. However, he also chops down 2 trees per year for 10 years, so he chops down a total of 2 * 10 = 20 trees.

The total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 (initial trees) + 100 (new trees) - 20 (trees chopped down) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130 trees, we multiply 130 by 0.3, which is 39 trees.

So, the total number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the raise in salary.

The monetary reward is $5000, which is a one-time payment. 

The raise in salary is 5% of his weekly salary, which is $2000. 
5% of $2000 is 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

Since the raise is applied to his weekly salary, we need to calculate the new weekly salary after the raise. 
New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the new weekly salary by 52 to get the total yearly salary.
Total yearly salary = $2100 * 52 = $108,000.

Now, we add the monetary reward to the total yearly salary to get the total earnings for the year.

20 times * 25 kilometers = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
2 times a week * 3 weeks = 6 times
6 times * 60 kilometers = 360 kilometers

Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: 2600"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

The final answer is: 76"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Since she earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session, we need to find the number of sessions that will give her $60.

Let's start by dividing $60 by $5 (babysitting pay): $60 / $5 = 12 babysitting sessions.

Since 12 babysitting sessions would give her $60, we can check if mowing the lawn can give her the same amount. 

$60 / $4 (lawn mowing pay) = 15 lawn mowing sessions.

Since 12 babysitting sessions and 15 lawn mowing sessions both give her $60, we can conclude that Sara needs to mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost from the small pool in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. The amount of water lost from the big pool in 4 minutes is also 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This means that the current amount of water in the big pool is 4 times the current amount of water in the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

We know that the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons, and 16 gallons were lost, so the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We also know that this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the amount of water lost from the small pool is 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is y = x - 16.

Substituting y = x - 16 into the equation 2x - 16 = 4y, we get:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

44"
"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is $200. So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She will pay $165 per month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to return:
$2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, Janeth's remaining balance will be $220.

Final answer: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

Number of roses = 4

There are 11 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points of the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can complete per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can complete 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can complete half of that, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can complete 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, we can divide 360 by 6 to find the total time it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

60 / 60 = 1 hour

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest, so we need to find 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially. 

Now, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest this time. 

To find the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons.

84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of new pens Ram can make from the ink of the 25 pens.

Since Ram can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many full pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

However, this calculation only accounts for the ink from the 25 pens and does not take into account the pens that Ram already has. Since Ram starts with 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he made to the original 25 pens.

Total pens = 25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

"To find the total number of letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he sends and receives.

He was a pen pal with 5 people, but stopped being penpals with 2 of them. So, he is now penpals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each person sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, he sends 2 letters a week to each of the 3 people, making a total of 2 * 3 = 6 letters per week.

Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes. To find the total time spent writing, we need to multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write one page.

Time spent writing per week = 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes

4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:
30 boys - 3 girls = 27 boys

The current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know that he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:

- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows were added to each stall. 

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 20 stalls. 

So, the number of cows added to each stall is 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

Now, we add the initial number of cows in each stall (20) to the number of cows added (2) to find the total number of cows in each stall: 
20 + 2 = 22 cows.

Since we want to know the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the total number of cows in each stall by 8:
22 * 8 = 176 cows.

The final answer is: 176"

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.3 (which is equivalent to 30%): 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52:
52 - 8 = 44 apples for Jamal.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas:
52 (Andrea's apples) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) = 124 fruits.

The final answer is: 124"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day separately and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the amount of flour needed for 36 cookies as follows:

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen
3 dozen = 3 * 2 cups = 6 cups

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. We can calculate the amount of flour needed for 30 cookies as follows:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen
2.5 dozen = 2.5 * 2 cups = 5 cups

Now, we add the amount of flour needed for both days:

6 cups (today) + 5 cups (tomorrow) = 11 cups

Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference between the total price of the house and her budget is:

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. The solo song has 54 lines. This is the number of lines Sean has to memorize for the song.

2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. So, the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines.

3. Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

4. The second scene has six more lines than the song. So, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.

5. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize in the second scene is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

6. To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Since Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This can be represented as 39 = (1/10)x.

To find the value of 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

"To calculate the total amount of money Susan earns, we need to first determine the total number of minutes she works.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide the total minutes she works by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval, which is $5. 15 * $5 = $75.

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
The youngest son washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on each day.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add up the total count of activities done in the two days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities done in the two days: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370"
"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the number of crates he sold on each day.

- Monday: 0 crates (closed)
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend: 20 crates

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can find the difference by subtracting the total crates sold from the target.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The initial bid was $200. Since the bids rose by $50 each time, the subsequent bids would be:
- $250 (after the first person)
- $300 (after the second person)
- $350 (after the third person)

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid for the desk is the sum of the initial bid and the 3 subsequent bids: 
$200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100

The final answer is: $1100"
"To calculate the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year and the total miles driven per day.

Total miles driven per year = 2 * 30 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 30,000 miles/year

Total miles driven per day = 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles/day

Total miles driven per month = 60 miles/day * 30 days/month = 1800 miles/month

Total miles driven per year = 1800 miles/month * 12 months/year = 21,600 miles/year

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:

Total cost of driving = Total miles driven per year * $2 per mile
Total cost of driving = 21,600 miles/year * $2/mile
Total cost of driving = $43,200/year

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Total bonus per year = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Total cost per year = Total cost of driving + Total bonus per year
Total cost per year = $43,200/year + $1,800/year
Total cost per year = $45,000/year

The final answer is: $45,000"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Time exercised on Monday = 16 minutes
Time exercised on Sunday = 23 minutes
Total time exercised on Monday and Sunday = 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total time by 2.

Time needed on Tuesday = 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper. 

In this case, the paper is folded in half, so we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each side has 16 pages, and we have two sides, we need 2 pieces of paper to make a single tabloid."
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

She spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total amount spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had:

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total amount spent) = $15

Annika has $15 left.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: 2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his regular earnings and the bonus.

Watson works 5 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. So, he works a total of 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 20 days in April.

His regular earnings for April would be 20 days * $10/hour = $200.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus. 

So, his total earnings for April would be $200 (regular earnings) + $300 (bonus) = $500.

Final answer: $500"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beats 80% of the people.

"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find the weight loss per week.

Weight loss per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we can divide the total weight by the weight loss per week.

Total weight = 8 pounds
Weight loss per week = 2 pounds

Number of weeks = Total weight / Weight loss per week
= 8 pounds / 2 pounds
= 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in 15 days.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

Therefore, the total number of new limbs the person will grow is 5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract the total cost from the amount he has: 
$6000 - $1950 = $4050

So, Theo has $4050 left to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Total eggs consumed per day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27 years.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32 years.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's start by finding Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can find Noah's current age by adding 6 to Cera's age.

Noah's current age = Cera's current age + 6
Noah's current age = 46 + 6
Noah's current age = 52

Now, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah. We also know that six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now. Let's represent the current population of Chile as 'x'. Then, six years ago, the population of Chile was x/2.

We can set up an equation using the information that the population six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah:

x/2 = 3000 * 52

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 3000 * 52 * 2
x = 312000

So, the current population of Chile is 312000."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

2. Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna (20) to the marbles his father gave him (8) to find the total number of marbles: 20 + 8 = 28 marbles.

3. The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store is 50 + 28 = 78 marbles.

4. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight: 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:
Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is:
Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:
Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, but the number of pencils in each box is not specified. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. 

So, Jam has 3x + 2 pencils. 

Meg has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46.

Since the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 48 = 26
3x = -22
x = -22/3

Since the number of pencils in a box cannot be negative, this equation doesn't have a valid solution. However, we can try to find a different approach.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and the total number of pencils is 26. We can set up the equation:
3x + 2 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x = 24
x = 8

So, each box has 8 pencils. 

Now, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has:
3 boxes * 8 pencils/box = 24 pencils
Adding the 2 loose pencils, Jam has 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Now, we can find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have:
Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. 
Total pencils = 26 + 46 = 72

Since each box has 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed:
72 pencils / 8 pencils/box = 9 boxes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream on the coffee.

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes used:

65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we multiply the number of ice cubes by 12:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

Now, let's calculate the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The cream makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

The total weakening effect is the sum of the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

So, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of new records the 5 people received. We know that they left with 7 new records.

Since each person received 7 new records, we can multiply the number of people by the number of new records each person received to find the total number of new records:

5 people * 7 new records/person = 35 new records

Now, we know that 2 old records are required to get 1 new record. So, to find the total number of old records, we can divide the total number of new records by 2:

35 new records / 2 old records/new record = 17.5 old records

Since we can't have half a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't simply round down because the question asks for the number of old records the 5 people brought in. 

We know that 5 people received 35 new records, and 2 old records are required to get 1 new record. So, the total number of old records the 5 people brought in is 35 * 2 = 70.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given:
- Total number of employees = 100
- Junior programmers are 2/5 of the total number of employees
- Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month
- Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
2/5 of 100 = (2/5) * 100 = 40 junior programmers

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, their salary is:
$2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

Now, let's find the number of senior programmers:
Total number of employees = 100
Number of junior programmers = 40
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:
Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers)

"To find the total time required to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so the remaining charge is 100% - 60% = 40%.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how many guns they can share equally, we need to add up all the guns they have and divide by the number of people.

Total number of guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + RJ's guns + Richard's guns
Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5
Total number of guns = 24

There are 4 people, so we divide the total number of guns by 4:
24 / 4 = 6

So, each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50%
New value of each share after the first year: $8 + (50% of $8) = $8 + $4 = $12
Decrease in the second year: 25%
New value of each share after the second year: $12 - (25% of $12) = $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is: 
8 shares * $9 per share = $72

Final value of Maria's shares: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.
John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. 

Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students. 

We are given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. So, we can set up the equation:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

So, the smallest group has 105 students.

105"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's represent the number of cows as 'x'. Then, the number of chickens will be 2x.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2 * 20 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Total number of legs = (number of chickens * 2) + (number of cows * 4)
= (40 * 2) + (20 * 4)
= 80 + 80
= 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh has, we need to calculate the number of balls he had at the end of the fourth week. 

Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week. 

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since Josh dropped 3 balls, but 2 were caught, he lost 1 ball. So, he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls left to juggle on stage."
"To find the weight of each animal, we can use the given information:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
Container weight: 20 pounds
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds
Green toad: 50 pounds
Yellow snake: 60 pounds
Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight = 20 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 210 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day after taking his coach's advice, and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Tyson originally runs 5000 meters per day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, which is 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters. So, the new distance he runs per day is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find the price of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Since Juice Box A is 4 dollars and Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, the price of Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Since Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, the price of Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts after the discount, we need to first calculate the original total cost of the shirts and then apply the discount.

Original total cost of the shirts = 2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60

Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.4 * $60 = $24

Total cost after discount = Original total cost - Discount amount
= $60 - $24
= $36

Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Total daily revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Now, let's find the percentage increase in daily revenue:
Percentage increase = ((New revenue - Old revenue) / Old revenue) * 100
= (($1100 - $1000) / $1000) * 100
= ($100 / $1000) * 100
= 10%

The factory is making 10% more per day now.

"To find the total monthly cost, we need to calculate the weekly cost of food and multiply it by 4, then add the monthly costs of treats and medicine.

Weekly cost of food: $25 * 4 = $100
Monthly cost of food: $100 * 4 = $400
Monthly cost of treats: $20
Monthly cost of medicine: $100

Total monthly cost: $400 + $20 + $100 = $520

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:
$520 * 12 = $6240

The final answer is: 6240"
"To find the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday: 1 hour
Tuesday: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Wednesday: 0.5 hours (half an hour)
Thursday: Half as long as the cooking class, so half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours
Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add the hours together: 
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours.

"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots for the roses. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

In total, April needs 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since she already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea initially had $36.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.

"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours
Total time spent on these activities: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time:
0.3x = 15
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50 hours

Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available for the activities. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities:
- 1 round of mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- 2 rides on go-karts: 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the budget:
$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will have to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. We know that the total cost per person includes the cost of 1 round of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and 2 go-kart rides. 

Let's calculate the total cost per person:
- 1 round of mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- 2 rides on go-karts: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost per person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the total cost per person:
$60 / $30 = 2

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs, he must have had $2 left. This means he had $2 initially, and he spent $2 on gumballs. So, the amount of money he had initially was $2 + $2 = $4.

Billy had $10 initially, and he spent $4 on gumballs, so the amount of money he spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

Now, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we can divide the amount of money he spent on candy ($6) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$6 / $1.5 = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer is 0.05 days, which is less than 1 day."

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before scoring 8 points. Since Sara scored 8 points, we can assume she had 0 points before scoring 8. 

Now, we know Erin has three times more points than Sara. Since Sara had 0 points before scoring 8, Erin had 3 * 0 = 0 points before scoring 14. 

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the question. Let's re-evaluate the information given. 

If Erin scored 14 points and now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8, we can set up an equation to find Erin's original points. 

Let's say Erin had x points before scoring 14. Then, after scoring 14, she has x + 14 points. Since she has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation:

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs:

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 
   20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
   So, the total cost for etching the logo is $4 per frame. 
   Total cost for picture frames with etching: $880 + $4 = $884

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400
Materials cost = 0.8 * $400
Materials cost = $320

Now, we need to add the cost of the materials to the cost of the labor. Since the problem doesn't mention the labor cost, we can assume that the labor cost is also included in the original $400. Therefore, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the same as the original cost.

Total cost = Original cost
Total cost = $400

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Total cost of equipment: $400,000
Percentage of faulty equipment: 40%

Number of faulty pieces = 40% of 400,000 = 0.4 * 400,000 = 160,000

Since the total number of pieces is not given, we can assume that the total number of pieces is equal to the total cost of equipment, which is $400,000.

Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to first determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. To find the number of apples picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount of money by the price per apple:

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, and she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, she picked 2 * 12 = 24 apples on Wednesday.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies given or eaten: 23 + 42 + 44 = 109

Since Rachel initially had 23 cookies, we subtract the total number of cookies given or eaten from the initial number of cookies:
23 - 109 = -86

However, since we cannot have a negative number of cookies, this means that the initial statement is incorrect. The total number of cookies exceeds the initial number Rachel had."
"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months.

First, we need to calculate the total interest. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% or 0.10, and the time is 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Karan needs to pay.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,105

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $1,105."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 
Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18 (profit)

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: 
$18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

We can set up the equation as follows:
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir is performing with just its female members, the number of girls performing is 26.

However, half of the people performing can't make it to the show. This means that 26 / 2 = 13 people can't make it. 

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 13 (girls who made it) + 3 (teachers) = 42.

"To find the total number of parts in the ratio, we add 5 + 6 = 11. 

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we divide 165 by 11 to find the value of each part: 165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Now, we multiply the value of each part by the number of parts for each person: 
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Tim saves $42 per month by canceling his cable subscription.

"To find the total work time, we need to convert all the time to the same unit. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we can convert 4 hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 240 minutes
- Recording time: 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes
- Editing time: 90 minutes
Total work time: 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100 = 20%

"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. 

Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. 

20 more than double the number of books is 72 + 20 = 92.

So, Wendy will need 92 books to complete her task.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she initially had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, the total number of cards she gave away is 24 + 5 = 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has after giving away 29 cards. She initially had 50 cards and gave away 29, so she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

However, Erica also received 17 cards from family and friends. So, the total number of cards Erica now has is 21 + 17 = 38.

"To find out how many slices Jenny has initially, we need to add the fractions 1/3 and 1/4. 

First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 3 and 4, which is 12. 

Now, we convert both fractions to have the same denominator:
1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, we can convert this to a decimal or find the whole number equivalent. 

7/12 is approximately 0.583, or 5 whole slices and 7/12 of a slice.

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract 2 from 5 whole slices:
5 - 2 = 3

Now, we need to add the remaining 7/12 to 3. To do this, we convert 3 to a fraction with the same denominator (12):
3 = 36/12

Now, we add the fractions:
36/12 + 7/12 = 43/12

To convert this to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
43 ÷ 12 ≈ 3.583

Since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we round down to 3 whole slices and 5/12 of a slice.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has and then divide the result by his daily earnings.

Mark has $50 initially.

"To calculate the builder's total earnings for a year, we need to first calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of working days in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and 4 weeks a month. So, the total number of working days in a month is 6 * 4 = 24 days.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of working days in a year is 24 * 12 = 288 days.

The builder earns $50 per day, so his total earnings for a year would be 288 * 50 = $14,400.

"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the number of cups of flour required by 4 (since he's making a quadruple batch). 

3 cups of flour * 4 = 12 cups of flour

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide the total cups of flour by 2 to find the number of bags needed:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we multiply the number of cups of milk required by 4:
1 cup of milk * 4 = 4 cups of milk

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total cups of milk by 2 to find the number of bottles needed:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

Now, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. In 8 hours a day, it uses 8 * 900 = 7200 watts per day.

In 30 days, it will use 7200 * 30 = 216,000 watts.

Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts, we can convert 216,000 watts to kilowatts by dividing by 1000:

216,000 / 1000 = 216 kilowatts.

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage will be:

7200 - (5 * 900) = 7200 - 4500 = 2700 watts per day.

In 30 days, the new daily usage will be 2700 * 30 = 81,000 watts.

Converting this to kilowatts, we get:

81,000 / 1000 = 81 kilowatts.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original daily usage and the new daily usage:

216,000 - 81,000 = 135,000 watts.

Converting this to kilowatts, we get:

135,000 / 1000 = 135 kilowatts.

Therefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- Cost of meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- Cost of cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00
Total cost = $50.00

Time taken to read the book = Total number of words / Reading rate
Time taken to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words per minute
Time taken to read the book = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish the book 30 minutes before the time he needs to be at the airport.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
Total hours worked in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 640 hours
Total amount paid in May = 640 hours * $15/hour = $9600

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees.
Total hours worked in June = 30 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 480 hours
Total amount paid in June = 480 hours * $15/hour = $7200

Total amount paid in the two months = $9600 + $7200 = $16800

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost of the items Sally purchased. $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount. $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and also explode. However, we don't have information about the percentage of candles that explode. 

We know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, but we don't know if this is the same percentage that also explode. To find the answer, we would need more information about the relationship between the two defects.

However, assuming that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that explode, we can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = 5% of 50000
= 0.05 x 50000
= 2500

So, 2500 candles smell like wet dog. If we assume that this is also the percentage that explode, then:

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode = 5% of 50000
= 0.05 x 50000
= 2500

Therefore, 2500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, we can set up the equation:

3x + 60 + (number of apples gathered from average trees) = 500

Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the average trees as y. Since Joanne gathers y apples from the average trees, her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

Now we can rewrite the equation as:

3x + 60 + y = 500

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, we can also write:

x + 2x + 15 + 45 + y = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 60 + y = 500

3x + 60 + y = 500

3x + y = 440

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

From the first equation, we can express y as y = 440 - 3x.

Substitute y into the second equation:

3x + 60 + 440 - 3x = 500

Combine like terms:

60 + 440 = 500

This equation is true for any value of x, so we need to find another equation to solve for x.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so x = 30.

Now we can find y:

y = 440 - 3x
y = 440 - 3(30)
y = 440 - 90
y = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. We know that the total number of heads is 180, and each camel has 2 heads and each dromedary has 1 head. We can write the equation for the total number of heads as:

2c + d = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps (humps) is 304, and each camel has 2 bumps and each dromedary has 1 bump. We can write the equation for the total number of bumps as:

2c + d = 304

However, these two equations are the same, which means we have a system of linear equations with infinite solutions. But we can still solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for 'd' in terms of 'c':

d = 180 - 2c

Since we can't find a unique solution for 'c' and 'd', we can express 'd' in terms of 'c'."
"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * Zack's locker = 5

To find Zack's locker, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can set up the equation:

Zack's locker = 1/2 * Timothy's locker

Substituting the value of Zack's locker, we get:

20 = 1/2 * Timothy's locker

To find Timothy's locker, we multiply both sides by 2:

Timothy's locker = 20 * 2
Timothy's locker = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the distance Oliver must climb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's current elevation.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. 

The difference in elevation is 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet.

So, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

7,000"
"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the amount he received from the second bank and add it to the initial amount and the amount he received from the first bank.

The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $4000 = $8000.
The total amount he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we add the amount he initially had to the total amount he received: $5000 + $12000 = $17000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

Final numerical answer: 17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

2. The initial number of cats was 50. After 20 cats were taken away, the remaining number of cats is 50 - 20 = 30.

3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

4. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods:

1. The first 6 months: $8 per month
   6 months * $8 per month = $48

2. The next 8 months: $12 per month
   8 months * $12 per month = $96

3. The last 8 months: $14 per month
   8 months * $14 per month = $112

Now, we add the costs of all three periods:
$48 + $96 + $112 = $256

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, which is (1/3)x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is the rest, which is (2/3)(x + 6).

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

x + 2(x + 6) = 18

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So the original price of the jogger jeans is $2. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is $2 + 6 = $8.

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $8 - $2 = $6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

570"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds. The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's assume Kenny starts with x cards.

Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The amount of money he gets from selling 2/3 of the cards is 2/3 * $1.5 = $1.

He also has $50 in spending cash, so the total amount of money he has is $1 + $50 = $51.

Since the ticket costs $100, the amount of money Kenny has is not enough to buy the ticket. However, we can still find the number of cards he started with.

We know that 2/3 of the cards are worth $1, and the total amount of money Kenny has is $51. We can set up an equation:

(2/3)x = 51

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 51 * (3/2)
x = 76.5

Since Kenny can't have a fraction of a card, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also check if 76.5 cards would be enough to buy the ticket.

76.5 cards * $1.5 = $114, which is more than the ticket price of $100.

So, Kenny must have had more than 76.5 cards. Let's try 77 cards:

77 cards * $1.5 = $115.5, which is more than the ticket price of $100.

Since 76.5 cards are not enough, but 77 cards are more than enough, Kenny must have had 77 cards.

The final answer is 77."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

Total number of guests = 36
Number of guests who got two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 * 2 = 36

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, which is less than the total number of hotdogs needed, some guests will not get a second hotdog. To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the total number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed:

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = Total number of hotdogs needed - Total number of hotdogs prepared
= 80 - 36
= 44

Therefore, 44 guests did not get a second hotdog.

44"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00
   - Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the 20% discount:
   20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora currently has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1/4 of 15 gallons is 15 * 1/4 = 15/4 = 3.75 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3.75 gallons to pints. 

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can assume that 1% of his total money is 1 cent. This means he spent 99% of his money, which is $4.90.

Now, we know that George spent $5 initially and $4.90 on chips, so the amount left for candy bars is $5 - $4.90 = $0.10.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can calculate the number of candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars ($0.10) by the cost of each candy bar (75 cents). 

Number of candy bars = $0.10 / 0.75 = 0.1333 (round down to 0 since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar)

So, George bought 0 candy bars.

Final answer: 0"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine the total number of lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4):

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece
Total weight of the pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends. 

Total number of people = 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56

Now, divide the total oranges by the total number of people: 
56 / 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions: 
2 pounds of onions * $2.00 per pound = $4.00

The cost of the beef stock: 
2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00

The total cost of the ingredients: 
$4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, we need to divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving:
$8.00 / 6 servings = $1.33

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then find out how much earlier she should leave.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it will take Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette should leave 4 - 5 = -1 minute before Wayne. However, since Bernadette can't leave a negative amount of time, we need to re-evaluate the situation.

If Bernadette leaves 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she will arrive 11 minutes after Wayne. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads the sister with fewer beads has from the number of beads the sister with more beads has. 

Since Elizabeth has fewer beads, we subtract her beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to the oven:
The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus spends 3 hours baking, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window:
The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 times
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Now, we need to subtract the temperature decrease due to the window from the temperature increase due to the oven:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to oven = 15 degrees
Temperature decrease due to window = 6 degrees
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
James' swim time: 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

Jon's bike time: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
James' bike time: 80 + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Jon's run time: 50 minutes
James' run time: We don't know yet, but we'll call it x minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for Jon is 10 minutes less than James'. We can set up an equation:

40 + 80 + 50 = 36 + 85 + x - 10

Combine like terms:
170 = 111 + x

Subtract 111 from both sides:
59 = x

So, James' run time is 59 minutes.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P.

The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P.

The cost of buying a super ticket is $20, and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of buying a super ticket and a popcorn and a soda is $20 + $1 = $21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $21 - $2 = $19.

Now, we can set up the equation: $15 + P = $19.

Solving for P, we get P = $19 - $15 = $4.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as:
Volume = Length * Width * Height
Volume = 8 feet * 2 feet * 2 feet
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet * 10
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total Volume / 2
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2
Number of bags = 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total Cost = 160 bags * $12
Total Cost = $1920

The total cost of the potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden is $1920."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the number of red cards and add it to the number of red cards.

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Since the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

- Two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds
- Four 12-pound bags of carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3700 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips:
3700 / 2250 = 1.64

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Total earnings per week is 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings in a month is 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many plants Toni has, and then find out how many plants Shondra has.

Since Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
= 10 + (0.6 * 10)
= 10 + 6
= 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, and Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
= 16 - 7
= 9

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

Basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 6 * 25 = 150 cards
Baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 5 * 40 = 200 cards

Total number of cards: 150 + 200 = 350 cards

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the remaining cards are given to her students. 
Number of cards given to students: 350 - 50 = 300 cards

Since each student received 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the total number of cards given to students by 10.
Number of students: 300 / 10 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = $9. 
She received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = $10.
She received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 = 0.10 x 10 = $1.
So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid.

$9 (Kelly's payment) - $8 (Becky's payment) = $1.

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before Saturday and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Total shoes before Saturday = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Total shoes on Sunday = 100 - 180 = -80

Since you can't have a negative number of shoes, it means Fireman Frank will have 0 shoes on Sunday.

The number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is equal to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. 

To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100: (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

"To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with desktop computers is (3/4)x. The number of students without desktop computers is given as 20. 

We can set up the equation as follows:
(3/4)x + 20 = x

To solve for x, we can first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
3x + 80 = 4x

Now, we can subtract 3x from both sides of the equation:
80 = x

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how many books Sarah gave to each child, we need to first find out how many books she bought in total. 

Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books:

$300 ÷ $15 = 20 books

Since she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4:

20 books ÷ 4 = 5 books per child

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances (dairy or peanuts). 

We can do this by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number of kids allergic to both to avoid double counting. 

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets, hotel, and the total cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 per person, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the increased price, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. The increased price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds * 2 meals = 10 pounds per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds * 4 horses = 40 pounds per day.

For five days, the total consumption would be 40 pounds * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how many bags of oats are required to meet this consumption. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. 

To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total consumption by the weight of oats per bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors.

Since the razors come 4 to a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

The original price of 2 packs is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, we can consider the cost of 2 packs as the cost of 4 razors. So, the effective cost of 8 razors is $8.00.

Now, we need to subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost. $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Since there are 8 razors, we need to divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost of each individual razor. $6.00 / 8 = $0.75.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100. $0.75 * 100 = 75 cents.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, which is $5x. 
The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, which is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2 per week.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120

The total number of animals is 120."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4, since Rose bought 4 times the number of each item Sophia bought.

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

3 + 1 = 4"
"To determine the calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to reach his goal. 

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. 

From December 31st to July 19th, there are 181 days (July has 31 days, and December has 31 days, so 31 + 31 = 62, and 62 + 119 = 181).

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories over 181 days. 

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 
3500 calories / 181 days ≈ 19.3 calories per day.

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 19.3 calories per day to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday.

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house and the lot together cost $120,000. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is the sum of their individual costs, which is x + 3x = 4x. We know this sum equals $120,000.

So, 4x = 120,000

To find x, we divide both sides by 4:
x = 120,000 / 4
x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot (x), we can find the cost of the house:
Cost of the house = 3x
= 3 * 30,000
= 90,000

The house cost $90,000.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20) = $40 + $120 = $160.

2. Ali gives half of the total money to his sister: 
   Half of $160 = $160 / 2 = $80. 
   Remaining money = $160 - $80 = $80.

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner: 
   3/5 of $80 = (3/5) * $80 = $48. 
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we need to first find the time it takes Rob to shingle a house. 

Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. 
Double the time it takes Rob is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.
Adding 40 minutes to this gives us 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1/2 house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the individual rate:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 house per day

Since they need to paint a whole house, we can calculate the time required as follows:

Time = 1 house / (1/2 house per day) = 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the time to hours:

Time (in hours) = 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. 

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. 

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since they have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs. 

Now, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs together: 20 (sofas) + 66 (chairs) = 86.

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 86.

Tom spent $48 in total and $4 on the CD. So, the amount he spent on the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we can divide the amount spent on the headphone set by the cost of a CD:

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.

3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. However, it is stated that 3 times fewer passengers get on, so we need to subtract 3 times the number who got off from the number who got on. So, 63 - 3 * 21 = 63 - 63 = 0.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years.

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

The total cost of all three items is $2,400. To find the cost of one monitor, we subtract the cost of the computer and printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Therefore, one monitor cost $600.

2. George ate 5 candies.
3. George has 3 candies left.

From point 1, we can represent the number of candies Nick had as 2x, where x is the number of candies George had.

From point 2, we know that George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George had initially is 3 (the number he has left) + 5 (the number he ate) = 8.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of candies Nick had:

2x = 2 * 8 (since Nick had twice as many candies as George)
2x = 16

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 8

So, George had 8 candies initially. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings for the first half of the month.

Daily savings for the first half of the month = $1125 / 15 (15 days in the first half of April) = $75

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

Daily savings for the second half of the month = $75 * 2 = $150

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of the month to hit his target."

"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys he needs for his play set. Since his set needs to be five times larger than James's set, we multiply the number of toys in James's set by 5.

James's set has 80 toys, so Jonathan's set needs 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has, we can set up an equation: 
Let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Since Bill wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a hot and a cold day.

On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2 * 16 minutes = 32 minutes
Adding 2 minutes to this:
32 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 miles * 34 minutes/mile = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time between a hot day and a cold day, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. 
Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

To find out how many weeks it will take to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, and each of these buttons has 4 holes. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size: 12 * 1/4 = 12 * 0.25 = 3 cubic inches

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in angle of the sun relative to the ground. 

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. 

In 10 hours, the sun will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the initial angle is 90 degrees (a right angle). After 10 hours, the angle will be 90 - 32 + 50 = 108 degrees.

The final angle of the sun relative to the ground is 108 degrees.

Final answer: 108"
"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since the older son is 12 years old and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since the younger son is 8 years old, he will need 8 candles. The older son will also need 5 candles. 

So, James needs 8 + 5 = 13 candles in total.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, James will need 13 / 5 = 2.6 packs of candles. However, since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, James will need to buy 3 packs of candles.

The total cost of the candles will be 3 packs * $3 per pack = $9.

The final answer is: $9"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply 70 by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100), which is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate in total.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches.
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we need to follow the given information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
3. Richie scored 80 goals.

Let's start by finding the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can set up an equation:
Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = Mark's goals + 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We can set up another equation:
Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = Anna's goals + 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold (21) by the price of each lemonade ($4).

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 per day for 3 days, so he spent a total of:
$5 * 3 = $15

He has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has $55 left, he can buy:
$55 / $2 = 27.5

Since you can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 27 plastic action figures.

Now, let's add the number of wooden action figures (3) and plastic action figures (27) to find the total number of action figures:
3 + 27 = 30

The final answer is 30."

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required by the shops per month.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 20 * 4 = 80 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 15 * 4 = 60 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week, so in a month, it will order 30 * 4 = 120 roses.

Total roses required by the shops per month = 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses per week, so in a month, he grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses required by the shops: 
260 - 160 = 100.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in her savings account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

Final answer: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 1
Cost of bread = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves
Cost of bread = $3.00 * 1
Cost of bread = $3.00

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make.

192 / 8 = 24

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon to find out how much money Kate can make.

24 * $1.50 = $36

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the error by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find the temperature that is 4% more than 520. 
To do this, we multiply 520 by 1.04 (which is 100% + 4%): 
520 * 1.04 = 540

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 1 and adding 30, which equals 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying 60 by 2 and adding 5, which equals 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the two movies together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is 0.1 x $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = Total cost / Total pairs

"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned.

200 calorie units = 1600 / 200
200 calorie units = 8

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of units by 100.

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall, which is still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window height.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the daily protein intake and then multiply it by 7.

Daily protein intake = 200 grams (mushrooms) * 3 grams (protein per cup) / 4 cups (since 100 grams is 4 cups)
Daily protein intake = 200 * 3 / 4 = 150 grams

Weekly protein intake = Daily protein intake * 7
Weekly protein intake = 150 * 7
Weekly protein intake = 1050 grams

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he still needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15):

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

Final answer: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

Colby has 8 quarters, which is 8 * $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 / $0.05 = 69.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The original price of the shorts is $35. 
Price of the shorts after discount = $35

Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax. 
Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (this may vary depending on the location)
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

Total cost of the outfit including sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe started with $50. 
Amount of money left = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe doesn't have enough money to pay for the outfit, he will be short $6.70.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding their individual prices:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to consider the direction. In this case, we'll assume Tom is driving in the opposite direction of Bob. So, we'll add the speeds to find the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed + Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph + 70 mph
Relative speed = 125 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 125 mph
Time = 0.6 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60.
Time = 0.6 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Time = 36 minutes

Therefore, it will take Tom 36 minutes to catch up with Bob.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance. 

So, Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
= 20 miles - 3 miles

"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the hole. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time it will take to dig the hole.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
3. The cost of leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
4. The cost of running boards is $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
5. The cost of the upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus amount.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

His new monthly salary will be: 
$20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 2 = $10000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21000 + $10000 = $31000

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31000 * 12 = $372000

The final answer is: 372000"

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Since there are three bags, the total amount of flour is 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"To find the initial number of likes, we need to divide the total number of likes by 70. 

Initial number of likes = Total likes / 70
Initial number of likes = 2000 / 70
Initial number of likes = 28.57

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we can round down to 28.

Now, we need to add the 20000 new likes to the initial number of likes. 

Total likes = Initial likes + New likes
Total likes = 28 + 20000
Total likes = 20028

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she got $2 off because she had a voucher. So, the total cost for Clara was:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
$2 discount = $400 - $2 = $398

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for Sheila was:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% discount = $600 * 0.10 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and the result is negative, it means that Clara paid less than Sheila."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate her sales for each month.

In the first month, her sales from red hats were $400, which is half of her sales from green hats. So, her sales from green hats in the first month were 2 * $400 = $800.

Total sales in the first month = $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 
3/4 * $1200 = $900.

Total sales in two months = $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Subtract the current bank balance from the expected wage:
$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally received more money than her expected wage. To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the current bank balance from the expected wage.

$300 - $420 = -$120

However, since the result is negative, we can rephrase the question to find out how much Sally received instead. 

$420 - $300 = $120

So, Sally received $120 more than her expected wage. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the amount she received from her expected wage:

$300 - $120 = $180

Therefore, $180 was withheld from Sally's wage.

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane itself is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Adding the initial cost of the plane, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cooking time for the pork and then the beans. 

Since it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of 's' and 'g'. 

First, we can express 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation: g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute 'g' in the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.

Simplify the equation: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70.

Combine like terms: 2s + 40 = 70.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2s = 30.

Divide both sides by 2: s = 15.

Now that we know 's' is 15, we can find 'g' by substituting 's' into the equation g = 20 - s: g = 20 - 15 = 5.

So, there are 15 sheep and 5 geese on Lee's farm.

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

Total time available = 30 minutes
Time spent walking to the corner = 6 minutes
Time spent walking to the fire station = 13 minutes
Total time spent walking so far = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time left to get to school = Total time available - Total time spent walking so far
Time left to get to school = 30 - 19 = 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes to get to school without being late.

"To find the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes, which is twice the number of cookies Greta bakes. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

There is also a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since x is the age of a twin and y is the age of a triplet, we'll try to find integer solutions.

One possible solution is x = 8 and y = 6. 

The age of the older twin would be 8 + 7 = 15.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert 3 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time:
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

To find the total cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of one candy by 10: 
10 candies * $3.20 = $32.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost: 
$4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 months (10 years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Total coins Rong saves in 1 year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 1 year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as x. 
0.6x = cost of heartworm check

We know the total bill is the sum of the cost of vaccines and the heartworm check. 
x = $40 + cost of heartworm check
x = $40 + 0.6x

Now, we can solve for x. 
x - 0.6x = $40
0.4x = $40
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

The total bill is $100. The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

John brought $125. He spent $100 on the vet bill. 
$125 - $100 = $25

The final answer is 25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of squares, we need to determine the number of each color. 

We know there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color: 
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68

The total number of squares is 68.

The question asks for the total square feet, but since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total square feet is equal to the total number of squares. 

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can multiply 8 by 5 to get the number of regular chairs.

8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to get the total number of chairs needed.

40 (regular chairs) + 8 (high chairs) = 48

Since there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to add 57 chairs in total. However, Mia already has 48 chairs. To find out how many more chairs she needs, we subtract 48 from 57.

57 - 48 = 9

"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the threshold:
400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks set off in the city and the number of fireworks set off in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks set off in the city:
15 boxes of 20 fireworks each = 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
40% of 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks set off in her backyard:
3 boxes of 5 fireworks each = 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks she can see in the city and the number of fireworks set off in her backyard:

"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of people, drinks, and snacks.

There are 12 friends initially, and 7 more friends join them, making a total of 12 + 7 = 19 people.

Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks consumed is 19 * 2 = 38 drinks.
The total number of snacks consumed is 19 * 3 = 57 snacks.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76.
The total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

"To solve this problem, let's start by finding out how much gravel Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. 

So, the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Now, we subtract this from the total capacity of all three trucks to find out how much Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is also 50.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his share of the money by multiplying 3/5 of $100.

Gerald's share = (3/5) * $100 = $60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this amount from his share.

Gerald's remaining money = $60 - $10 = $50

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly amount they raise. 

$4200 / $2100 per hour = 2 hours

So, they need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

First, find the percentage of water used for industrial purposes: 
80% of 40% = 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:
100% - 32% = 68%

So, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2. 

So, we can divide 4 scoops by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy.

4 scoops ÷ 3 scoops per set = 1 set with 1 scoop left over

Since Erin can only buy 1 set of 3 scoops, she can buy 2 scoops (1 set of 3 scoops) and get 1 scoop free.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Now we solve for 'x': 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars: 
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed for students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256

For teachers' cars:
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed for teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students) + 64 (teachers) = 320

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who voted by midday (2/5 of 5000):
   2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people

2. Calculate the number of people remaining after midday:
   5000 - 2000 = 3000 people

3. Calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 (2/3 of the remaining people):
   2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people

4. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:
   3000 - 2000 = 1000 people

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4 pieces).

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days. 

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To determine the total number of smores needed, we need to calculate the number of smores for kids and adults separately.

For kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
For adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed: 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to calculate the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, which is 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 votes.

The total number of votes received by candidate A and B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"To find out how many apples Beck has initially, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples. 

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck initially has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount.

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Cost of 10-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a gallon jar
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find the number of students per group. 
Total students = 54
Number of groups = 6

Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

However, the question states that 12 groups are required. To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the required number of groups.

Number of groups needed = Total students / Required number of groups
Number of groups needed = 54 / 12
Number of groups needed = 4.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the question asks for the number of more groups needed, not the total number of groups. 

To find the number of more groups needed, we subtract the current number of groups from the required number of groups.

Number of more groups needed = Required number of groups - Current number of groups
Number of more groups needed = 12 - 6
Number of more groups needed = 6

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as 'x'. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor would be 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. So, we can set up the equation:

x (votes against) + 2x (votes in favor) = 33

Combine like terms:
3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 11

Now that we know x (votes against) is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To solve for P, we multiply both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians in total.

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as T. We can set up the equation:

$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn he has to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for:
$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time after reading
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Time spent on soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent on soccer = 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils. So, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils. So, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, the total time taken for the round trip = 2 hours + 2 hours
Total time taken for the round trip = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum, the total time Jack is gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time Jack is gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total wheels needed: 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total wheels needed from the available wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

There will be 276 wheels left."
"To calculate the discount, we need to find 20% of the original price of $1000.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

Final answer: $800"
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
   Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
   Number of movies in series = 600 / 3
   Number of movies in series = 200

2. Now, we need to find the number of remaining movies. Since 200 movies are in series, we subtract that from the total number of movies:
   Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
   Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200
   Number of remaining movies = 400

3. Next, we need to find the number of older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate it as follows:
   Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
   Number of older movies = 400 * 0.4
   Number of older movies = 160

4. Now, we need to find the cost of the movies in series. Since the cost of the series is $6 less than the cost of a normal movie, we can calculate it as follows:
   Cost of series = Cost of a normal movie - $6
   Cost of series = $10 - $6
   Cost of series = $4

5. Next, we need to find the cost of the older movies. Since the cost of the older movies is $5, we can calculate it as follows:
   Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
   Cost of older movies = 160 * $5
   Cost of older movies = $800

6. Finally, we need to find the total cost of replacing the movies. We can calculate it as follows:
   Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies
   Total cost = $4 + $800
   Total cost = $804

The final answer is: $804"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their driving speed as follows:
Driving speed = 50 mph
Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 mph
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 mph

Now, we know the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours) and their hiking speed (20 mph). We can use the formula:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score = 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is 1715 - 820 = 895.

The final answer is: 895"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 - 30 = 4

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
4 / 2 = 2

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so the total number of times is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. So, the total number of times for these two days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times for both types of days: 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish (this is not possible, so we will ignore this result). However, we can assume that the 17 fish taken out were not all orange, but a mix of both colors. 

Let's say the number of orange fish taken out is x. Then the number of white fish taken out is 17 - x.

Now, Bob has 3 - x orange fish and 4 - (17 - x) = 4 - 17 + x = -13 + x white fish.

We are told that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can set up the equation:

3 - x = 2(-13 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - x = -26 + 2x

Combine like terms:

3 + 26 = 2x + x

29 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 29/3

x is not a whole number, which is not possible in this context. However, we can try to find the closest whole number value for x.

x ≈ 9.67

Since x must be a whole number, we will round it to the nearest whole number. 

x = 10

Now, we can find the number of white fish taken out:

17 - x = 17 - 10 = 7

So, Bob bought 7 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. 

Total miles driven per week = 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week:

Fuel efficiency = 10 MPG
Total miles driven per week = 50 miles
Fuel consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumed per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of fuel consumed per week:

Cost of fuel per week = Fuel consumed per week * Price per gallon
Cost of fuel per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the amount she spent on the twenties.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 on the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 on the quarters.

The total amount she spent on lunch is $120 (twenties) + $35 (quarters) = $155.

Final answer: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and the temperature at night is 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
Number of groups with seashells = 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
Total seashells = 6 * 2
Total seashells = 12

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total amount paid in Month 1: 220 employees * $4000 = $880,000
Total amount paid in Month 2: 240 employees * $4000 = $960,000
Total amount paid in Month 3: 260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000

To find the total amount paid over the three months, we add the amounts paid each month:

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, which was $10. So, Sally's starting hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Sally also works 20 hours, so her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since she wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to achieve a 30% ratio of stuffed goats to her total number of stuffed animals."

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100

- 1 * 4 = 4 petals
- 1 * 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:
101 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 7 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used:
John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.
Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows in the bag:
35 (total marshmallows) - 18 (marshmallows used) = 17 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 17.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2, since they are making S'mores together:
17 (remaining marshmallows) / 2 = 8.5 S'mores.

Since you can't make half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores for each kid.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per game, so in 4 hours (240 minutes), he plays 240 / 20 = 12 games.

His friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so he plays for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, he plays 240 / 10 = 24 games.

The friend who is significantly better plays for 1.5 times as long, so he plays for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, he plays 240 / 30 = 8 games.

The total number of games played is 12 (Jack) + 24 (worse friend) + 8 (better friend) = 44 games.

The cost per game is 1 quarter, which is $0.25. So the total cost is 44 * $0.25 = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

To convert this to a decimal, divide 10 by 3:
O = 3.33

The final answer is: 3.33"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.

"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, Joe has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (amount from organizations) = $125,000 (amount from students)

Since there are 20 students, we can divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 students = $6,250 per student

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the second day first. 

Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate the time she walked on the second day as follows:

Time on the first day = 8 hours
Time on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days:

Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60:

Total time (in minutes) = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total time (in minutes) = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.

During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find 1/2 of 70, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35.

So, 35 cars left, leaving 70 - 35 = 35 cars in the parking lot.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the payment per task.

Number of tasks per cycle = 5
Number of cycles per day = 30
Number of days in a week = 7

Total number of tasks per week = 5 * 30 * 7 = 1050

Payment per task = $1.20
Total payment per week = 1050 * $1.20 = $1260

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 
6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food to find the difference: 
88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and the distance by the cost per mile.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

Week 1: 8,000 bars
Week 2: Half of Week 1 = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Week 3: Three times as much as Week 1 = 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Since the production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars, we can subtract this from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4. 
40% of $30.00 = 0.4 * $30.00 = $12.00.

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the fact that the distance traveled by the kangaroos is the same as the distance traveled by the turtles. We can set up an equation using the speed of the kangaroo and the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 108 hours / 4 turtles
Time = 27 hours

However, since there are 4 turtles, we need to multiply the time by 4.

Time = 27 hours * 4
Time = 108 hours

But we can simplify this by using the fact that the speed of the turtles is half the speed of the kangaroo. So, the time it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway is 4 times the time it would take for one turtle to travel across the highway.

Time = 4 * Time for one turtle
Time = 4 * (18 hours / 2)
Time = 4 * 9 hours
Time = 36 hours

We also know that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. So, Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows, we can divide 5 liters by 3 cows to find out how much milk one cow produces per day. 

5 liters / 3 cows = 1.67 liters per cow per day

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We can divide 25 liters by 1.67 liters per cow to find the number of cows needed.

25 liters / 1.67 liters per cow = 15 cows

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, we need to subtract 3 from 15 to find out how many more cows he needs.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.

Now, let's find the length of the glue sticks that are used:
- The first glue stick is 5/6 of 12 millimeters, which is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
- The second glue stick is 1/3 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
- The third glue stick is 1/2 of 12 millimeters, which is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add the lengths of the glue sticks that are used:
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total cost is $75 + $48 = $123.

"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned, which is half of 90 rooms.

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. You are 3 years younger than your brother.
2. You are 2 years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of your ages is 87.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. Then, your brother's age is 'x + 3', and your sister's age is 'x - 2'. 

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so it's 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, we can write the equation based on the sum of your ages: 
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy. 

54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we first need to calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, so she received 40 * $20 = $800.

Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips. 10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

Now, we subtract $80 from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total. $800 - $80 = $720.

To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we add their individual totals. $800 + $720 = $1520.

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

Total oranges given away = 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given away) = 3 oranges.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins: 
Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold) 
Total coins = 110

Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gives him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. Then, he loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he loses 20 marbles.
4. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy answers 80% of 10 questions correctly, which is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions.
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, her score from multiple-choice questions is 8 points.

For true/false questions: 
Amy answers 90% of 20 questions correctly, which is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions.
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, her score from true/false questions is 18 points.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy answers 60% of 5 questions correctly, which is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions.
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, her score from long-answer questions is 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Now, let's add up the scores from each type of question: 
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens.

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 per chicken, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he will make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much Isaias paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we can divide the total amount he needs to sell the chickens for by the number of chickens:

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each.

The final answer is: $61.11"
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the total cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is:
$1.5 * 20 = $30

Sarah's friend is selling the rope to her for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total amount she will receive is:
$2 * 20 = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she will receive:
$40 - $30 = $10

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's present age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her present age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24 years.

Since her present age is 8 years, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24 years. 

24 - 8 = 16 years.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * (1/2 * $4) = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in her cart: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money, it means that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to buy all the items in her cart. She is short $91.

Final answer: $-91"
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

Total runtime of the final concert = 65 minutes
Encore time = 15 minutes
Runtime of the final concert without encore = 65 - 15 = 50 minutes

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can divide the runtime without encore by 2 to find the runtime of her usual concerts.

Runtime of usual concerts = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so together that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, so they make 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the total number of chimichangas made on those three days: 250 (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) + 250 (Fridays) = 500 chimichangas.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to find out how many microphones were able to fit in pairs. 

Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, that means 80% of the microphones can fit in pairs. 

Number of microphones that can fit in pairs = Total number of microphones * 0.8
= 50 * 0.8
= 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we need to divide the total number of microphones that can fit in pairs by 2 to get the number of pairs.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

3 groups of 8 birds each = 3 * 8 = 24 birds

Now, let's add the birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and the groups together: 
6 (birds in the bushes) + 4 (birds flying overhead) + 24 (birds in the groups) = 34 birds

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

She started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide 50 by 5.

50 ÷ 5 = 10

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 
4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals

Now, subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference:
40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we multiply 100 by 1/4, which equals 25. 

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants: 100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we multiply 75 by 2/3, which equals 50.

The number of flowering plants is the remaining plants after subtracting the indoor and outdoor plants: 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x meters per second.

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob (x), we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Whirligig speed = 5x
Whirligig speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig speed = 55 meters per second

"To find the cost of the yogurt, we need to know its price. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays $11 for her daily goods. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, we subtract the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost to find the cost of the carrots. $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day.

"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

New hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12 per hour

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

Weekly earnings = $12 per hour * 8 hours per day * 5 days per week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is 3x + 5x + x = 9x.

Since Joe paid her $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, she mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since she made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

3x = 7

where x is the number of notebooks Joseph had initially.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a notebook, we can round down to 2 notebooks for Joseph.

Now, we know Joseph had 2 notebooks initially and Martha had 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 (Martha's notebooks) - 2 (Joseph's notebooks) = 5

So, Martha now has 5 more notebooks than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis' distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's compare their total pages:
Denise's total pages = 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages
Daniel's total pages = 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total pages from Denise's total pages:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that he has 8 bowls of soup (since it's more efficient to calculate with the larger number).

There are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself) and 2 children. So, the total number of people is 3 + 2 = 5.

Since there are 8 bowls of soup and 5 people, we can divide 8 by 5 to find out how many bowls each person can have for dinner. 

8 ÷ 5 = 1.6

Since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we'll round down to 1 bowl per person for dinner.

Now, we need to find out how many bowls are left for lunch. 

5 people had 1 bowl each for dinner, so 5 bowls were used. 

8 (initial bowls) - 5 (used bowls) = 3 bowls left.

There are 2 children, and 3 bowls left.

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 20 / 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards are needed for small masks, which is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards
Since you can't buy a fraction of a yard, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, 3 sets of 2.25 yards are needed for large masks, which is 3 * 2.25 = 6.75 yards.

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6.75 yards (for large masks) = 16.75 yards.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find the total number of acres, we need to first calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the size of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * $0.20 = $64.

Time for normal sudoku: 45 minutes
Time for extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Total time spent on sudoku: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks.

Number of bottles of water: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5

Since you can't drink half a bottle of water, we can round down to 7 bottles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2 * 20 (bologna thrown at red balloons) + 3 * x (bologna thrown at yellow balloons) = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3x = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 6

This means that Benny threw 6 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. Since there are 20 red balloons, the number of yellow balloons can be found by subtracting the number of red balloons from the total number of balloons. However, we don't know the total number of balloons. We can find the total number of balloons by subtracting the number of bologna thrown at red balloons from the total number of bologna thrown:

20 (bologna thrown at red balloons) + 3x (bologna thrown at yellow balloons) = 58
20 + 3 * 6 = 58
20 + 18 = 58

This confirms that the total number of balloons is indeed 20 + 6 = 26.

Now, we can find the number of yellow balloons by subtracting the number of red balloons from the total number of balloons:

Number of yellow balloons = Total number of balloons - Number of red balloons
= 26 - 20
= 6

Therefore, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost of the items is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each of them had initially.

$31 / 2 = $15.50.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

15.50"
"To find the total number of fruits initially, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left.

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

Number of students playing tennis: 6
Number of students playing volleyball: 2 * 6 = 12
Number of students playing soccer: 16 + 22 = 38

Total number of students: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

Total number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

1. Cats: 3
2. Dogs: 3 times the number of cats, so 3 * 3 = 9 dogs
3. Rabbits: 2 fewer than dogs, so 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits
4. Fish: 3 times the number of rabbits, so 3 * 7 = 21 fish
5. Gerbils: 1/3 the number of fish, so 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices per day.

Since the loaf has 24 slices, we can divide 24 by 6 to find out how many days it will last:

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells: 60 months.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

4"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.

Since he picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 / 2 = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the amount of water in the tank, we first need to calculate the amount of water in the tank initially. Since they filled the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate it as follows:

Pool water = 10000 gallons
Tank water = Pool water / 2 = 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we can calculate the remaining water in the tank after 6 days as follows:

Remaining water = Initial water in tank - (Rate of emptying * Number of days)
= 5000 - (500 * 6)
= 5000 - 3000
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, so he has spent $10 * 5 = $50 on tickets. 

Now, he has $134 - $50 = $84 left.

To find out how many more movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since tickets for any other day cost $7, we'll use that price for the remaining movies. 

$84 / $7 = 12 movies.

So, Colby can see 12 more movies.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, which is 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked:

200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to first find the total number of Junebugs removed.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days:
300 / 5 = 60.

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has. 

First, let's add up the number of toys she already had: 
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9
Total toys she already had: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she now has: 
Total toys now: 62
Total toys she already had: 48
Number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14

The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the value of A from the second equation into the third equation: 
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the value of P from the third equation into the first equation:
(2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10 into the equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80
Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
A = J + 10
A = 20 + 10
A = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age:
P = A + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is:
4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons
Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes:
8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the additional balloons are:
5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial balloons and the additional balloons:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

The total number of balloons the girls have is 24."
"To find the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to add the boxes donated by the 10 people and the boxes they already own. 

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already have 15 tables, so we need to subtract that from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables.

"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in earnings between the two machines, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour and runs for 24 hours a day. In a month with 30 days, it will produce:
45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the total earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 will be:
43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

The total earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 will be:
32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $192,000

To find the difference in earnings, subtract the earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the earnings of the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $192,000 = $67,200

Therefore, Fern will make $67,200 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month.

"To determine the amount of money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the extended stay.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. 

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours beyond the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

The cost of the 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat
Total hay for goats = 75 pounds

Total hay for sheep = 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep
Total hay for sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds
Total hay needed = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the expenses.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, subtract the cost of pencils from his remaining money:
250 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he will have:
200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars left

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a pen:
100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 4 pens

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first determine how many bottles she gave out. Since there are 29 pupils and each pupil gets 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles given out is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she can get is 9 * 100 = 900.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she can get: 900 - 58 = 842.

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the costs into three components: the fixed charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. Fixed charge: $40
2. Labor charge: 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75
3. Parts charge: $60

Total cost = Fixed charge + Labor charge + Parts charge
Total cost = $40 + $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs. 

The original price of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He then sells 5 CDs for $40 each. 
The total amount he gets from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James is left with, we subtract the amount he paid from the amount he got from selling the CDs.
$200 - $90 = $110.

So, James is left with $110.

The final answer is: $110"

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find out how far James swims in the first part of his journey. Since he swims 60% of the total distance, we can calculate it as follows:
   Distance = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles

2. Now, we need to find out how long it takes James to swim 12 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour:
   Time = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours

3. After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for:
   Rest time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

4. Now, we need to find out how far James has to swim in the remaining part of his journey. Since he has already swum 12 miles, the remaining distance is:
   Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

5. In the remaining part of his journey, James swims at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. So, the time it takes him to swim the remaining 8 miles is:
   Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours

6. Now, we need to add up the time spent swimming, resting, and the time spent swimming the remaining distance:
   Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Let's denote Dinar's points as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points will be x + 10. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's points will be (x + 10) - 20 = x - 10.

We also know that the total points of the three teams is 45. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored: x - 10 = 15 - 10 = 5.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15:

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60

So, Vince stapled 60 sets of 30 reports, which is a total of 60 * 30 = 1800 reports.

"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes from the total sleep time.

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep while sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am. We need to convert this time to minutes.

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
15 minutes + 120 minutes = 135 minutes

Now, we need to add the time she was asleep while sleepwalking to the time she was awake before sleepwalking.

475 minutes (total sleep time) - 135 minutes (sleepwalking time) = 340 minutes

340 minutes is the total time Kim slept on her bed that day."
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to a numerical value. Two dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups. 

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, the initial number of occupied beds is 200.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds will increase by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted will be 50 * 14 = 700.

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be 200 (initial occupied beds) + 700 (additional beds) = 900 beds.

Now, to find the total number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital.

Total capacity of the hospital = 1000 beds
Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 900 beds

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

   Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
   Non-work emails per day = 9

2. Now, we find out how many of the non-work emails are to family.
   Emails to family per day = 2/3 * Non-work emails per day
   Emails to family per day = 2/3 * 9
   Emails to family per day = 6

3. Now, we find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend.
   Emails to boyfriend per day = 1/3 * Non-work emails per day
   Emails to boyfriend per day = 1/3 * 9
   Emails to boyfriend per day = 3

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried. 
So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 2 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jason) + 2 (Jordan) = 8 balls.

Therefore, the coach brought 8 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up the equation 4 * 31 = total holes on the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124

Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, the total number of holes dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 (the holes dug by the end of the third day) = 93 holes.

The final answer is: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add these amounts together: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as 'A', the number caught by Stan as 'S', and the number caught by Alex as 'X'. 

We know that:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the value of X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 3 into the above equation:
A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339
Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360
Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The bird traveled a total of 264 miles south, so the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself.
She received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies from her office party.
Her friends gave her 4 dozen (48) brownies.
So, the total number of brownies she received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.
Now, subtract the number eaten from the total: 66 - 18 = 48.

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members:
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

Time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid racquets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The cost of the remaining phones (3 phones in total, but the first two are already accounted for) is 3 - 2 = 1 phone at full price, and 2 phones at half price. 
The cost of the full-priced phone is $600.
The cost of the two half-priced phones is 2 * ($600 / 2) = $300.

The total cost of the remaining phones is $600 + $300 = $900.

The total cost of all the phones is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

Now, we can add the number of players in both teams to find the total:

Total number of players = Number of players in Zeke's team + Number of players in Carlton's team
= 20 + 13
= 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Given length = 15 feet and width = 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate half of 50 as 25. Then, we add 4 to get 29.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA (50) to the number of states in India (29) to get the total number of states in both countries.

50 + 29 = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how much Tyler needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the books he wants to buy. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has $14 saved, he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs to earn ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation: 

Let's say Richard has x cherries. 
Then, Robert has x + 10 cherries. 
We know Robert has 30 cherries, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 30
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 
x = 20
So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. 
To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract 50 from 60: 
60 - 50 = 10
So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries: 
30 - 10 = 20

"To find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to subtract 4 from the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday. 

Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday = 15
Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday = 15 - 4 = 11

Now, we know the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days. 

Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday = 10
Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day.

Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday = 10 * $6 = $60
Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday = 15 * $6 = $90
Earnings from apple pie on Saturday = 11 * $15 = $165
Earnings from apple pie on Sunday = 15 * $15 = $225

Total earnings for Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225
Total earnings for Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days = $225 + $315 = $540

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total hours Pamela will be outside. 

She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so the total hours outside is 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen. 

Since her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we can divide 32 by 8 to find out how many bottles she needs: 32 / 8 = 4.

So, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

To find the average size, we add the sizes of both boots and divide by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine the total number of flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each flower plus the space between them.

The length of the flower bed in inches is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Since Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, we need to convert this to inches as well: 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total space taken up by each plant and the space between them: 
- Each flower takes up 12 inches
- Each space between flowers takes up 18 inches
- Total space taken up by each pair of flowers and space = 12 + 18 = 30 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken up by each pair of flowers and space to find the total number of pairs of flowers Pat can fit in her flower bed:
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a pair of flowers, we'll round down to 44 pairs of flowers.

Since each pair of flowers consists of 2 flowers, Pat can fit 44 * 2 = 88 flowers in her flower bed.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 88 - 17 = 71 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost of the flowers Pat needs to buy is 71 * 6 = $426.

The final answer is: $426"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, we can calculate Edgar's brother's daily pretzel consumption as follows:

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels per day

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7:

9 pretzels per day * 7 days = 63 pretzels per week

"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount for roses = 30 - 27 = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses.

"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we can calculate how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$2,000 (monthly income) - $500 (monthly savings) = $1,500 (monthly expenses)

There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide the total expenses by 12 to find out how many months she can afford to buy shoes.

$1,500 / 12 = $125 per month

Now, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year.

$125 (monthly expenses) / $1,000 (cost per pair) = 0.125 pairs per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the monthly pairs by 12 to find the total number of pairs she can buy in a year.

0.125 pairs per month * 12 months = 1.5 pairs per year

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pair of shoes, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

1.5 pairs per year ≈ 1 pair per year

"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can assume that the time it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp is also 10 minutes.

Now, to peel 90 shrimp, it would take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes, since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute.

To cook 90 shrimp, it would take her 90 / 30 = 3 minutes, since she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.

So, the total time it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes (peeling) + 3 minutes (cooking) = 18 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner running on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner running on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The net cooling effect is the difference between the two:
12 degrees - 6 degrees = 6 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, we need to calculate the warming effect for the 2 hours the air conditioner was off:
2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

Now, we subtract the net cooling effect from the warming effect to find the final temperature difference:
6 degrees - 4 degrees = 2 degrees

The final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as 75 * 1 = 75 years.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since 75 years have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, and Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill was born as 90 - 75 = 15 years.

Now, we know that Bill was x years old when he saw the comet for the first time, and 15 years have passed since then. So, we can set up the equation: x + 15 = 90.

Solving for x, we get x = 90 - 15 = 75.

Therefore, Bill was 75 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 trips, and it's half the number of trips the first plane makes, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips.

We know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 * x = 3/4 * 88 = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (x - 66) = (1/2) * 88 = 44.

Therefore, the first plane takes 44 flights to France in one day.

"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4 years respectively. 

2. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W. We know that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4.

3. Since Helene is twice the average age of the group, we can write the equation: H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4).

4. We also know that the total age of the children is 20. So, we can write another equation: 3 + 4 + H + W = 20.

5. Now we have two equations:
   H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4)
   3 + 4 + H + W = 20

6. Simplify the first equation: H = (7 + H + W) / 2
   Multiply both sides by 2: 2H = 7 + H + W
   Subtract H from both sides: H = 7 + W

7. Now substitute H = 7 + W into the second equation: 3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20
   Combine like terms: 14 + 2W = 20
   Subtract 14 from both sides: 2W = 6
   Divide both sides by 2: W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3 years.

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on this amount.

However, the problem states that Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This information is irrelevant to the calculation of the lawyer's contribution.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, and the problem doesn't specify the amount contributed by Walter, we can assume that Walter's contribution is the total amount collected so far, which is $2000. 

So, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 times $2000, which is $6000."

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

750 / 15 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 family members, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

The total number of slices would be x + 2x = 3x.

Since the total number of family members is 6, we can set up the equation 3x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 2.

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 4.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. The total number of slices is 6, and the number of slices for the adults is 4. 

To find the percentage, we can use the formula: (number of slices for adults / total number of slices) * 100
= (4 / 6) * 100
= 66.67%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours (total available) - 8 hours (total spent) = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time: 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To find the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold and multiply it by the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars in total, we can set up the equation: 8x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 * 3 = $45.

The cost of renting the studio per student per month is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total cost of renting the studio per month is $300 + $180 = $480.

The total earnings of the dance studio in a month will be the total cost of renting the studio per month, which is $480.

However, the question asks for the expected earnings, which implies that the dance studio also earns money from the students' lessons. To calculate the total earnings, we need to know the number of sessions per month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions per month is 10 students * 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks = 120 sessions.

The total earnings from the students' lessons per month is $1.50 * 10 * 120 = $1800.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480 (renting the studio) + $1800 (students' lessons) = $2280.

The final answer is: $2280"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

To find the total number of new porcupines in a year, we multiply the number of new porcupines per month by 12.

Total new porcupines in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the initial population of porcupines to the total number of new porcupines in a year to find the final population.

Final population = 50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

The final population of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490.

1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the depth. The area of the base is the width times the length, so:

Area = width * length
Area = 14 * 25
Area = 350 square feet

Since the depth is 4 feet, we multiply the area by the depth to get the volume:

Volume = Area * depth
Volume = 350 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Now, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume (gallons) = Volume (cubic feet) * 7.48
Volume (gallons) = 1400 * 7.48
Volume (gallons) = 10592 gallons

The pool company instructed the Smith family to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need:

Total gallons needed = Volume * 5.9
Total gallons needed = 10592 * 5.9
Total gallons needed = 62348 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool:

Cost = Total gallons needed * cost per gallon
Cost = 62348 * 0.10
Cost = 6234.80

The final answer is: $6234.80"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

Number of red sticks = 9
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = 11

Total number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 220 miles

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles
Difference = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's find the number of students over 16 years old: 
Half of 3000 students are over 16 years old, so 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so 1500 / 4 = 375 students are male over 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 years old: 
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

Next, let's find the number of students under 16 years old: 
3000 - 1500 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 are male, so 1500 / 2 = 750 students are male under 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of female students under 16 years old: 
1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old: 
1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. 
Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. 
10 - 5 = 5

"To find out how much water was pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

To find out how much water is remaining, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
34% = 28% + x
x = 6%

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 6%."
"To calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate her total weekly income and then determine how many weeks it will take her to save 20% of the car's price.

First, let's calculate her total weekly income:
- Wages: $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week
- Tips: $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week
- Total weekly income: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

Now, let's calculate the total amount she needs to save for the down payment:
- 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we'll divide the total amount she needs to save by her total weekly income:
- $2,000 / $1,000/week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, the amount of money he has left is $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, this is not possible as he cannot have a negative amount of money. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which means she kept 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.

Now, we subtract the number of sweets Anne kept from the total number of sweets to find out how many sweets were given to her friends: 900 - 120 = 780.

Since Anne gave the sweets equally to her 10 friends, we divide the remaining sweets by 10: 780 / 10 = 78.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

78"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% increase for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: 139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each type of album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album. 

72 / 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the remaining number of guests is 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the remaining number of guests is 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people opted for a late checkout, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.
5. The total number of guests now is 61 (remaining after early and late checkouts) + 30 (new check-ins) = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

John has 22 bananas in total."
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2.
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9.

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals as L and the number of small stuffed animals as S.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. If we denote the price of a small stuffed animal as P, then the price of a large stuffed animal is 3P.

We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so P = $4.

Now, we know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so S = 2L.

We are also given that the total earnings from the sales are $120. The total earnings can be calculated as the sum of the earnings from large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals:

Total earnings = (3P * L) + (P * S)
= (3 * 4 * L) + (4 * 2L)
= 12L + 8L
= 20L

Since the total earnings are $120, we can set up the equation:

20L = 120

To find the value of L, we can divide both sides by 20:

L = 120 / 20
L = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

S = 2L
= 2 * 6
= 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month (30 days), we multiply the daily amount by 30: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for the other two packages and then multiply it by 8.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension (100% - 40% chance of getting an extension) = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 100% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5
3. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
4. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, but Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 20% chance of getting an extension, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * (0.4 + 0.6) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5

Now, we add up the probabilities of each scenario: 0.3 + 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 1.5

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 1.5 * 100 = 150%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 150%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 4750 remaining seats, and there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as follows:

Number of medium-sized beans = 2 * Number of large beans
= 2 * 75
= 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

Number of small beans = Number of medium-sized beans / 3
= 150 / 3
= 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can place along his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to make each move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To find the total number of packs, we need to first find the total number of apples in two boxes. 

There are 40 apples in one box, so in two boxes, there are 40 * 2 = 80 apples.

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school:
Total amount of money lost = Number of years in school * Annual income before college
Total amount of money lost = 4 years * $25,000 per year
Total amount of money lost = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating:
Total amount of money earned = Number of years in school * Annual income after college
Total amount of money earned = 4 years * $75,000 per year (since his income tripled)
Total amount of money earned = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to repay the loans:
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = Total amount of money lost + Total amount of money earned
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = $100,000 + $300,000
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = $400,000

Since Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year, the number of years it would take to repay the loans is:
Number of years to repay loans = Total amount of money needed to repay loans / Annual loan amount
Number of years to repay loans = $400,000 / $50,000 per year
Number of years to repay loans = 8 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length * Width
Area = 8 feet * 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America: 26
Number of cities in each country: 5
Population of each city: 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches = 51 inches
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: $576.67"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply it by the number of days.

3/8 = 0.375 (as a decimal)
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:

Hours worked by each painter = 7.875 / 4 = 1.96875 hours

The final answer is 1.96875."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,865.58."

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."

"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost per tile.

Since each tile is 1ft in length and your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required as follows:

200 SqFt / 1 SqFt per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles.

2400"
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12.

Yearly cost = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Let's say Jake ate x slices.
Becky ate x + 3 slices.
We know Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3 = 10
Solving for x, we get:
x = 7
So Jake ate 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2 to find out how many slices Silvia ate:
Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know how many slices each person ate:
Becky ate 10 slices
Jake ate 7 slices
Silvia ate 14 slices

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by each person:
10 + 7 + 14 = 31

The total number of slices eaten is 31.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, which is the sum of Donovan's and Betsy's parts. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched. 

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of money they had as 'x'. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she has 3/4 of her money left. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has 2/3 of her money left.

Since they both have $60 left, we can set up the equation:

(3/4)x + (2/3)x = 60

To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12. 

(9/12)x + (8/12)x = 60
(17/12)x = 60

Multiply both sides by 12 to get rid of the fraction:
17x = 720

Now, divide both sides by 17:
x = 720 / 17
x = 42.35 (round down to 42, since you can't have a fraction of a dollar)

So, Maggie and Riza initially had $42 each.

Now, let's find out how much money they have left:
Maggie has 3/4 of $42 = (3/4) * 42 = 31.5
Riza has 2/3 of $42 = (2/3) * 42 = 28

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

"To find out how much Jenny spent on roses, we need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. 

Since a dozen roses cost $15, 15 roses would cost 15 / 12 * 15 = $18.75. 

Jenny paid with 5 $5 bills, which is 5 * 5 = $25. 

Now, we subtract the cost of roses from the amount she paid: 25 - 18.75 = $6.25.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 6 dollars would be 6 * 4 = 24 quarters. 

For the remaining 0.25, we need 1 quarter.

So, Jenny leaves with 24 + 1 = 25 quarters."

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time from the second train's arrival to its departure is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after its arrival, so its departure time is the same as its arrival time, 60 minutes after the first train's arrival.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 80 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:
- Waiting for the first train: 10 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 30 minutes (since it arrives after the first train leaves)
- Waiting for the third train: 60 minutes (since it arrives after the second train leaves)
- Waiting for the fourth train: 20 minutes (since it arrives after the third train leaves)

Total waiting time = 10 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far from the total number of toothpicks required.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks at the same rate. To do this, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10).

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks she needs.

80"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. We can calculate the selling price:

Selling price = $2000 * 1.20
Selling price = $2400

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide it by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Selling price
Discount = $2666.67 - $2400
Discount = $266.67

Now, we can calculate the percentage discount:

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = ($266.67 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage discount = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many jellyfish a single spring creates in 1 hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and every second a jellyfish is created, we can calculate the number of jellyfish created in 1 hour as follows:

60 minutes/hour * 1 jellyfish/second = 60 jellyfish/hour

Since there are 4 hours, we can multiply the number of jellyfish created in 1 hour by 4:

60 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 240 jellyfish

Now, since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, we can multiply the total number of jellyfish created by 5:

240 jellyfish * 5 = 1200 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 1200 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, that means he walked 2 miles to the store (half of 4 miles). 

The time it took him to walk to the store is 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

Now, he has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles. The time it took him to walk back home is also 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

The total time it took James to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home, which is 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, there are a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches for $3.00 each, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry will get x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we need to subtract the amount of fence Sam gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply the price of each type by the number sold.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= 67500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= 11250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB bike
= 105 * 500
= 52500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= 67500 + 11250 + 52500
= 131250

The final answer is: 131250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

Number of classes per week: 5 days * 2 classes/day = 10 classes
Total minutes per class: 40 minutes
Total minutes per week: 10 classes * 40 minutes/class = 400 minutes

Since John also spends extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends on these days.

Extra learning time per day: 1/16 * 60 minutes = 3.75 minutes
Total extra learning time per week: 3.75 minutes/day * 2 days = 7.5 minutes

Now, we can find the total minutes John spends learning per week:
Total minutes per week: 400 minutes + 7.5 minutes = 407.5 minutes

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
407.5 minutes / 60 = 6.79 hours

The final answer is: 6.79"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball will bounce to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of 'x', the amount they ate is x/2.

We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so x - x/2 = 270. 

Simplifying the equation, we get x/2 = 270. 

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 540.

So, the amount left after the T-Rex ate is 540 kilograms. 

Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, the initial amount must be 2 times 540, which is 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area to be painted, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of shaken sodas and the total number of sodas left.

Initially, Ellen shook 3 sodas. Then, her brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 2 shaken sodas. 

Ellen's friend can get sprayed with soda from one of the 2 shaken sodas. 

The total number of sodas left is 12 - 3 (initially shaken) - 1 (taken by Ellen's brother) - 2 (taken by Ellen's brother) = 6.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 2/6 or 1/3.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%.

The final answer is 33.33."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

Total distance = 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to help and the number of people he can help per day.

Billy is available to help for 31 days in March (since he takes 20% of the days off). 20% of 31 days is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days off. 

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of people he can help per day by the number of days he is available to help: 6 people/day * 25 days = 150 people.

Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide.

"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this total time per day, we need to multiply it by the number of days.

1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to calculate 3.5 times the distance Amber ran. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
3.5 times 8 miles is 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance. 
52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles) = 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

1. The item that was returned is $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

2. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

3. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we add the cost of the items after the discounts to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - (x/5) = (4/5)*x.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6*15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can calculate Caroline's age since she is three times older than Ben:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her annual savings and then divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings.

Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Her annual savings will be $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Lauren wants to save for 20 years. To find out how much she needs to save, we multiply her annual savings by the number of years: $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Now, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings to find out how many years she needs to work: $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years.

However, since she already has 0 years of work experience, we need to subtract the 20 years she plans to work from the total years she needs to save. Therefore, she needs to work for 20 - 0 = 20 years.

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total population:
Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To find the total distance driven in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by the number of times John visits his parents in a month.

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since she plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days to get 70 miles.

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, we can divide the total distance Sofie will walk (70 miles) by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk. 

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 400 toys were ordered, the fifth worker must produce 400 - 220 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of both Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 23 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 23 = 46 stickers initially.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags he can make.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly to reach half of the way around the earth, we need to divide the circumference of the earth by 2.

Distance = Circumference / 2
Distance = 40,000 km / 2
Distance = 20,000 km

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 km at a rate of 400 km per day.

Number of days = Total distance / Rate
Number of days = 20,000 km / 400 km/day
Number of days = 50 days

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
   So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.
3. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   So, the speed of the faster car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Since Vince's age 2 years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we know A is also 9.

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with 200 crayons. Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces.

To convert the weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds, we divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a pound). So, 200 ounces / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces. Converting this to pounds, we get 200 ounces / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 12.5 pounds (crayons) + 12.5 pounds (boxes) = 25 pounds.

Final answer: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make from the tree, we need to calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet, we divide 64 feet by 4 to get the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by 5 to get the total number of planks.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we add the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can find her speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time: 
2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk by dividing the distance by her speed: 
1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 
40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate the total amount she has saved so far.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 * 8 = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save the remaining amount of $28. Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each type of tree and then add them together.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds from each type of tree: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

2. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles. We subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's start by assuming the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. 

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, the amount of water in the second mug is 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

Now, we know that the temperature of the water in the second mug is x degrees. Since the total amount of water is 1 ounce, the temperature of the water in the second mug is 1/5 of the total temperature.

We also know that the temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees. The total amount of water is 5 ounces, so the temperature of the water in the first mug is 33/5 = 6.6 degrees.

Since the total temperature of the water is the sum of the temperatures of the two mugs, we can set up the equation:

x + 6.6 = 40

Solving for x, we get:

x = 40 - 6.6
x = 33.4

So, the temperature of the second mug is at least 33.4 degrees.

The final answer is: 33.4"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, three weeks will have 21 days (3 * 7).

Total number of cows added in 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added in 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs without the discount. 

Each pack costs $10.00, and there are 4 packs, so the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 9 * 4 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many scoops 6 potatoes make: 
6 potatoes / 3 scoops = 2 scoops per potato

Now, we need to find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops are: 
3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops

Now, we know that 6 potatoes make 2 scoops, and 1 less than 3 scoops is also 2 scoops. So, 6 potatoes make 2 scoops, and 1 less than 3 scoops also make 2 scoops. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate to make 18 scoops. 
We know that 6 potatoes make 2 scoops. 
18 scoops / 2 scoops per 6 potatoes = 9 sets of 6 potatoes
9 sets of 6 potatoes = 54 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 54 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. We can represent the total number of passengers as 5x + 9x = 14x, where x is the multiplier for the ratio. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 14x = 84 and solve for x. 

14x = 84
x = 84 / 14
x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women on the bus. The number of women is 9x, so 9 * 6 = 54.

Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can find out how many Carrey collected by dividing 22 by 2.

Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, we know that the total number of seashells is 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, since Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's assume x is the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can set up the equation:

x = 2300 * 0.2

x = 460

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the total demand. We can do this by subtracting the current production from the total demand:

x - 4200 = 460 - 4200 = -3740

Since we can't have a negative number of bottles, we need to find the difference between the total demand and the current production in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced.

Let's recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced:

2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can divide the total demand by the current production to find the number of days it would take to meet the total demand:

460 / 4200 = 0.1095 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of bottles, not days.

Let's recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced:

2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can divide the total demand by the current production to find the number of bottles that need to be produced:

460 / 4200 = 0.1095

To find the number of bottles that need to be produced, we can multiply the number of days by the current production:

0.1095 * 4200 = 460.7

Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of bottles that need to be produced to meet the total demand, not the number of days.

Let's recalculate the total demand in terms of the number of bottles that can be produced:

2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we can divide the total demand by the current production to find the number of bottles that need to be produced:

460 / 4200 = 0.1095

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple, so the number of purple wearers is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

She dresses 1/4 of the octuplets in blue, so the number of blue wearers is 1/4 * 8 = 2.

Since 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, the number of purple wearers with bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the purple wearers with bows and the blue wearers, which is 2 + 2 = 4.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple by dividing the number of purple wearers with bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiplying by 100:

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Total reports received = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday and Thursday:
Total reports received on Wednesday and Thursday = Total reports received - Reports received on Monday and Tuesday - Reports received on Thursday and Friday
= 5168 - 1907 - 2136
= 5168 - 4043
= 1125

Since we know the total number of reports received on Wednesday and Thursday, we can find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the number of reports received on Thursday from the total:
Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received on Wednesday and Thursday - Reports received on Thursday
= 1125 - 2136
= -1011

However, the number of reports cannot be negative. This indicates that the problem has no solution or the given information is inconsistent."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, we need to find out how much land is left. Abraham started with 80 square meters. He sold 40 square meters and then 20 square meters, so he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

Abraham sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 20 square meters for 20 x $3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he received from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = 3120 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation:
B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation:
R = 4B

Now, we are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

"To solve this problem, let's first determine how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's denote the amount she gave to her sister as x. 

So, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x. This amount is 4/5 of her initial amount, which is 4/5 * 15 = 12.

Now, we can set up the equation: 
15 - x = 12
x = 15 - 12
x = 3

This means Rissa gave $3 to her sister. 

Now, we know that Rissa gave $3 to her sister, so Ronnie also gave $3 to her sister.

Initially, Ronnie had $5. After giving $3 to her sister, Ronnie is left with 5 - 3 = $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each color as x. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, we can set up the equation:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + x (yellow) = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Since x represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together:

The cost of the new box is $12, so the cost per pod is $12 / 120 = $0.10 per pod.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 of 8, which is 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, he used 2.25 - 2 = 0.25 inches of the chalk on Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 0.25 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of the total chalk will be used in 'x' days. We already used 0.25 inches on Monday, so the remaining chalk is 5 - 0.25 = 4.75 inches.

20% of 4.75 inches = 0.20 * 4.75 = 0.95 inches

Since the teacher uses 0.25 inches on Monday, the remaining chalk will be 0.95 - 0.25 = 0.70 inches.

Now, we need to find 'x' such that 20% of 4.75 inches is equal to 0.70 inches.

0.20 * 4.75 = 0.95 (as calculated earlier)
0.20 * x = 0.70
x = 0.70 / 0.20
x = 3.5

Since 'x' represents the number of days, it cannot be a fraction. The teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students on varsity.

Number of girls on varsity = 1/3 * 12 = 4
Number of boys on varsity = 1/4 * 12 = 3

Total number of students on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7

Total number of students in the class = 12 boys + 12 girls = 24

Number of students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity
= 24 - 7
= 17

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought. 

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 
Thrice as many as Mike is 3 * 5 = 15. 
2 more than 15 is 15 + 2 = 17.

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the total refund for 1600 gallons would be:

1600 * $3.5 = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total with $27,000.

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can divide $27,000 by $500 to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy:

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets

Since each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets by 100 to find the total number of books:

54 sets × 100 books/set = 5400 books

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books Bob can buy per school:

5400 books ÷ 3 schools = 1800 books per school

The final answer is: 1800"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.
3. He put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left.
4. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So, he now has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags, then multiply the number of bags by the cost per unit.

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
Number of bags = 850 kg / 50 kg
Number of bags = 17

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per unit
Total cost = 17 * $18
Total cost = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of pizzas needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since both types of pizzas require 3 pizzas, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. Therefore, she needs to buy a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to determine how old John was when Digimon was released. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim at that time, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can write the equation as:

2x = 28 - (number of years since Digimon's release)

However, we don't know the exact number of years since Digimon's release. We can find it by subtracting the current year from the year Digimon was released. Since Digimon was released in 2000, we can assume the current year is 2020 (for simplicity). 

2020 - 2000 = 20 years

Now we can rewrite the equation as:

2x = 28 - 20
2x = 8
x = 4

This means Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released. Since Digimon was released in 2000, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each person: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The answer is 6."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week. 
Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we calculate 50% of the cost of the scotch and add it to the cost of the scotch:
50% of $60 = 0.5 * $60 = $30
$60 + $30 = $90 per bottle

Now, we multiply the cost per bottle of cognac by the number of bottles:
$90 * 20 = $1800

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted in the two days:
- White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140.

"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, the question asks for the height from the second floor's floor, which means we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor. So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. 

Since the height of the roof from the second floor's floor can't be negative, we need to re-evaluate the question. The question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, which means we need to find the height of the roof above the second floor. 

So, the height of the roof above the second floor is 240 - 60 = 180 inches.

"To find the total amount Stephen needs to pay, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * $300 = $6.

The total amount Stephen needs to pay is the initial $300 plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

To find the amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency of packing.

The volume of the jar is calculated as length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as 0.3 * 675 = 202.5.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a jelly bean, we round down to 202 red jelly beans.

   The remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years separately.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. So, the total cost for 5 years is:
5 years * $2/year = $10

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means the new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $3

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $3. So, the total cost for 3 years is:
3 years * $3/year = $9

Now, we add the total cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years:
$10 + $9 = $19

The final answer is: $19"
"To determine the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required for each group.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, we have 3 grades (4-7), so we'll have 3 groups in total.

Now, we need to calculate the total time required for each group. Each group has 45 minutes to try the escape room.

Total time for 3 groups = 3 groups * 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

Therefore, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To find the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of 4 wooden tables at $20 each is 4 x $20 = $80.
The cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each is 2 x $10 = $20.

The total amount Ali has to pay John is $80 + $20 = $100.

"To find the length of the longer piece, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can write the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday and then add 1 inch.

Monday's rain: 2 inches
Twice of Monday's rain: 2 * 2 = 4 inches
Adding 1 inch to that: 4 + 1 = 5 inches

Therefore, there will be 5 inches of rain on Tuesday.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initial price in November: $40
Price in December after 80% increase: 
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Price in January after 50% decrease from December:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and then add them together.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate, Charlie will earn:
4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie will earn:
2 * ($80 - (25% of $80))
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. Now, let's divide the sum by 9:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70.

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

Original amount - x = 1/4 * Original amount

Let's represent the original amount as 'x'. 

x - x = 1/4 * x
0 = 1/4 * x
0 = x/4
0 = x

This equation doesn't make sense, as Eve can't give away all her pomelos. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's try again. If Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, that means she gave away 3/4 of the original amount.

Original amount - x = 1/4 * Original amount
x - x = 1/4 * x
0 = 1/4 * x
0 = x/4
0 = x

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of apples Walter ate: 
   2/5 of 60 apples = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples

2. Calculate the remaining number of apples after Walter ate 24 apples:
   60 - 24 = 36 apples

3. Calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister:
   25% of 36 apples = (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples

4. Calculate the remaining number of apples after Walter gave 9 apples to his sister:
   36 - 9 = 27 apples

5. Calculate the total amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples:
   27 apples * $3/apple = $81

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Assuming a 24-hour day, and considering he travels for 3 days, the total hours traveled would be 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The initial number of grapes is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at the school that day, we need to add the number of sick teachers to the number of substitute teachers.

Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Total number of teachers = 13 + 9 = 22

Therefore, there were 22 teachers at Rydell Elementary School that day.

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost of cheese per week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.
The total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Now, we need to find the total number of hours the custodian works in 5 days:
Total hours worked = 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total time spent cleaning classrooms by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100 = 50%

The custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms on average."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, we have the capacity of each shelf: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

The total capacity of the middle two shelves is 10 + 10 = 20 books. Adding the capacity of the top shelf, the total capacity is 20 + 15 = 35 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide 110 by 35 to find out how many sets of shelves she needs. 
110 / 35 = 3.142857 (approximately 3.14)

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, Elly needs 4 sets of shelves to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs
Cost per dozen = $2.40
Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozens
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total selling price:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Total selling price = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per $1 = 20 * $1 = $20

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $20 - $12
Profit = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the number of red hats: 1/2 of 100 hats is 50 red hats.

2. Then, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find the remaining hats: 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

3. Next, we find the number of blue hats: 3/5 of the remaining 50 hats is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

4. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost of each stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks: $15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 110) + 40
Total questions = (0.7 * 110) + 40
Total questions = 77 + 40
Total questions = 117

Now, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test:

Questions correct on the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct on the first test = (0.6 * 70)
Questions correct on the first test = 42

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can set up an equation:

(42 + x) / 117 = 0.7

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 117:

42 + x = 0.7 * 117
42 + x = 81.9

Now, we can subtract 42 from both sides:

x = 81.9 - 42
x = 39.9

Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 39.9 is closer to 40 than 40 is to 39.9, so we can round down to 40.

Audrey needs to get 40 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, we can set up the equation:

x (strawberry cubes) + (5x - 4) (blueberry cubes) = 116

Combine like terms:

x + 5x - 4 = 116

Combine the 'x' terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes (x), we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the number of points she scores per game.

Number of games played per year: 40
Number of years: 4

Total points scored: 160 * 21 = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He picked up a bead that wasn't a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble.
5. Now, he has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers.

Since Jason gets 1 customer for every 25 telephone calls, to get 30 customers, he needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them together.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 candles.

Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

"To find the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 20 * 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:
20 = (1/2) * y, where y is the number of robots.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2:
y = 20 * 2
y = 40

So, there are 40 robots.

Now, we can find the total number of items Dominick saw by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
Total items = 40 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs)
Total items = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 6 hours by 60 minutes to get 360 minutes per day.

Now, we divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

4 plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.
8 plants need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
The remaining plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.
8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so that's 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to hop 100 yards is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time = 5 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Phineas to swim in the water. Since the distance in water is also 100 yards, and he swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, the time it takes him to swim 100 yards is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time = 10 minutes

Since these two times are independent of each other, we add them together to get the total time:
Total Time = Time on land + Time in water
Total Time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in June. Since June has 30 days, and he sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts per day * 30 days = 300 doughnuts per month

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, we can multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:

300 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $600

Therefore, Derrick makes $600 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to calculate his new speaking speed and then divide the total number of words by that speed.

First, we need to find John's new speaking speed. Since his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed, we multiply his starting speed by 2.5.

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page.

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can divide the total number of words by John's new speaking speed to find the time it would take him to speak 10 pages.

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 hours

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days (5) and add it to the total number of people for the first three days.

Total number of people for the rest of the week = 60 * 5 = 300
Total number of people for the first three days = 50 + 70 + 140 = 260
Total number of people for the week = 260 + 300 = 560

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 560."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during each stage.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the amount of the first 30 seconds popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also popped from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add the kernels that popped from the residual heat to the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process: 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim plans to make. He wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and an extra gallon that is twice as tart. 

So, the total amount of lemonade is 4 + 1 = 5 gallons.

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 1 cup of lemon juice is obtained from 6 lemons, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed as follows:

5 gallons * 4 cups/gallon = 20 cups
20 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 20/6 = 3.33 lemons

Since we can't use a fraction of a lemon, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Tim will need 4 lemons for the regular gallons and 4 lemons for the extra gallon. 

Total lemons needed = 4 + 4 = 8 lemons.

"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find Emma's age. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we have both their ages, we can find the average by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2

"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells found.

Total seashells found = Tom's seashells + Nancy's seashells + Benny's seashells
Total seashells found = 214 + 432 + 86
Total seashells found = 732

Number of cracked seashells = 67

Number of good seashells = Total seashells found - Number of cracked seashells
Number of good seashells = 732 - 67
Number of good seashells = 665

The final answer is: 665"
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

For the dinner plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $6.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $6.00 = $72.00

For the bowls, Avery needs 12 bowls at $5.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $5.00 = $60.00

For the salad plates, Avery needs 12 plates at $4.00 each, so the total cost is:
12 * $4.00 = $48.00

Now, let's add the costs together:
$72.00 (dinner plates) + $60.00 (bowls) + $48.00 (salad plates) = $180.00

Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we need to first find out how long it took Steve to finish it, which is given as 10 hours. 

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we need to find half of Steve's time first. 

Half of Steve's time = 10 / 2 = 5 hours

Now, we add 2 hours to this half to find Anna's time.

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours

"To find out how much feed the pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. 

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs in total, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs his guests will eat and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

The cost of hot dogs: 8 packs * $2 per pack = $16

The final answer is: $16"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 5 children.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10 * 2 = 10 + 20 = 30.
4. The original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the truck.

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to first find the age of the older brother. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can find the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can find the total age of the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. 

The older brother is 24 years old, and the younger brother is 12 years old. The total age of the brothers is 24 + 12 = 36.

There are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old. The total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48.

The total age of all the siblings is 36 (brothers) + 48 (sisters) = 84.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga practice, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is:
15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes

She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so the total time spent on yoga per week is:
60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks is:
300 minutes * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes

Now, let's add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
30 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 1230 minutes

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60:
1230 minutes / 60 = 20.5 hours

The total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is 20.5 hours.

The quilt will be 101 square feet."
"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

Since a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, we can calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower as follows:

50% of 36 = 0.5 * 36 = 18
36 + 18 = 54 seeds

Now, we can find the total number of seeds altogether by adding the seeds in the small and large sunflowers:

36 (small sunflower) + 54 (large sunflower) = 90 seeds

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's total.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a 50% discount on the original price of $8 each. 

First, calculate the original price of 2 T-shirts: 2 * $8 = $16
Then, apply the 50% discount: $16 * 0.5 = $8
So, Jake pays $8 for 2 T-shirts.

For the shoes, Jake buys a pair with a 40% discount on the original price of $40.

First, calculate the original price of the shoes: $40
Then, apply the 40% discount: $40 * 0.4 = $16

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many days it takes to fill them in.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks as follows:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
- Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
- Igor had the correct number of beakers, so B = 7.

Now, we know that the total number of items on the lab bench is 29. We can write an equation to represent this:
T + B + P = 29

Substituting the values we know, we get:
8 + 7 + 16 = 29

This equation is true, so we don't need to do anything else. However, we want to find out how many beakers Igor lost. We know that Igor had 7 beakers and the total number of items on the bench is 29. Since the number of test tubes and Petri dishes is 8 + 16 = 24, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
29 - 24 = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed would be 'x/2' miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is 'x/2' miles per minute, we can calculate the time she took to run 4 miles as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (x/2)
Time = 8 / x

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is 'x' miles per minute, we can calculate the distance he ran as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = x * 16
Distance = 16x

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, the distance she ran would be 2 * 16x = 32x.

Now, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, which is equal to 32x. We can set up an equation:

32x = 4
x = 4 / 32
x = 1/8

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can calculate Vanessa's time:

Time = 8 / x
Time = 8 / (1/8)
Time = 8 * 8
Time = 64

The final answer is: 64"

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
= $80 + (25% of $80)
= $80 + (0.25 * $80)
= $80 + $20
= $100

Now, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
= $100 / 50
= $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the current age of John's youngest son.

Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. This means John's youngest son is 18 - 19 = -1 year old. However, since a person cannot be -1 years old, we need to re-evaluate the information.

Let's re-evaluate the information: John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. This means John's youngest son is actually 18 - 19 = -1 year old. However, we can assume that the youngest son is actually 18 years old, and the son James is the oldest son.

Since John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now, John's youngest son is 18 - 19 = -1 year old. However, we can assume that the youngest son is actually 18 years old, and the son James is the oldest son.

Let's re-evaluate the information: John had a son when he was 19, and James is 18 years old now. This means John's youngest son is actually 18 years old, and James is the oldest son.

Since James is 18 years old now, and John's youngest son is 18 years old, we can find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years by adding 3 to 18.

The age of John's youngest son in 3 years will be 18 + 3 = 21 years.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we need to find 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is 0.20 * $400 = $80. 

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $80 = $320.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the installation. Mark hires a mechanic for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The cost of the installation is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the installation to find the total cost. 

$320 (radiator) + $150 (installation) = $470.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so c + b = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write the equation: 2c + 4b = 70.

Now we have two equations:

1) c + b = 20
2) 2c + 4b = 70

We can simplify equation (2) by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us: c + 2b = 35.

Now we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate 'c': 
(c + 2b) - (c + b) = 35 - 20
This simplifies to b = 15.

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting b = 15 into equation (1): 
c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.
