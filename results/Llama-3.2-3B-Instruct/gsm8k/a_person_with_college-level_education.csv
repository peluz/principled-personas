"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. However, she only has 13 eggs left, which is not enough for baking. This means she can only bake 13 / 4 = 3.25 muffins (we'll round down to 3 muffins since you can't bake a fraction of a muffin).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs she has left after baking: 13 - 3 = 10 eggs.

She sells the remaining 10 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. So, she makes 10 * 2 = $20 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so the new value is 150% of $80,000 plus the original price.

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The final answer is: $150,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs per week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs per sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints per week.

Number of meters per sprint: 60 meters
Number of sprints per week: 3 times
Number of weeks per week: 1 week

Total meters per week = 60 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/week = 180 meters/week

The total number of meters James runs per week is 180 meters."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given to the chickens and subtract that from the total amount of feed she gives in a day.

She gives 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed she has given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed she needs for the day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

Now, we subtract the amount of feed she has already given from the total amount of feed she needs: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

Now, we add the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

The total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses is $50.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse to find the total number of sheep: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB.
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 120 GB is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

However, 20 minutes are spent on the restart, so the actual time spent downloading the first 60% is:
60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB.
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

The total time spent downloading the file is the sum of the time spent downloading the first 60% and the time spent downloading the remaining 40%:
80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the 200 GB file.

"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to break it down into three parts.

1. Distance traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

2. Time spent in standstill traffic:
Time = 2 hours

3. Distance traveled in the next half-hour at 30 mph:
Time = 0.5 hours
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

4. Time spent driving at 80 mph:
Time = 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill traffic) - 0.5 hours (at 30 mph)
Time = 1.5 hours

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 1.5 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Now, we add up the distances traveled in each part:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles
Total Distance = 315 miles

John is 315 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the tree needs to break even, we need to find the point where the net profit is greater than $0. To do this, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

However, this calculation only accounts for the initial cost and does not take into account the fact that the tree will start producing lemons after the first year. 

So, we need to subtract 1 from the result to get the correct number of years:

12 years - 1 year = 11 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos 11 years for the lemon tree to start earning money.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - x/3 - 2 - (2x - x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/3 + x/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 3 = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3x - 2x - 9 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 9 = 15

Add 9 to both sides:

x = 24

So, Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they travel the same distance on the first day, each train covers 80 miles westward.

On the second day, they cover 150 miles northward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the distances covered on both days to find the total distance covered by each train.

Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
- 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week
- 50 weeks/year * $700/week = $35,000/year

Her annual salary from coaching: 
- 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week
- 50 weeks/year * $450/week = $22,500/year

Total annual salary: 
- $35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, we multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 4 x 7 = 28 days in 4 weeks.

Total eggs in 4 weeks = 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.

Total dozens of eggs = 84 eggs / 12 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average speed.

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to complete the remaining 8 miles.

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we can use the formula:
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 8 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 8 mph

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink separately, then add them together.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = (27 + 20)/3 = 47/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 47/3 - 1 = 44/3 liters.

To convert this to a decimal, we divide 44 by 3: 44/3 ≈ 14.67 liters.

The final answer is 14.67."
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 31 - 6 = 25.

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age at that time: 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 

Since Kyle got a 25% discount, the price he paid is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. We can write this as:

0.75x = 19.50

To find the original price 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

So, the original price of the book was $26.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then add them together.

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop and then subtract that from the total distance of the trip.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. 

Henry stopped after 20 miles, so the distance he traveled before his second stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance between his first and second stops is 15 miles.

Therefore, Henry traveled 15 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots and the two pairs of heels together cost the same amount, we can set up an equation: 
Boots + $99 = x
where x is the cost of the boots.

We know that the boots cost five dollars less than the two pairs of heels, so we can write an equation:
Boots = $99 - 5

Now we can substitute the expression for the boots into the first equation:
($99 - 5) + $99 = x
Combine like terms:
$194 = x

So, the boots cost $194."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

Final answer: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the following guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by 3 (the number of guesses).

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first determine the number of silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4 points
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25
25% of 4 = 4 * 0.25 = 1
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5 points

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
Total points scored = 4 + 5
Total points scored = 9 points

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost per yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale price of 4 yogurts is $5.00, so the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate the total amount he got from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left, we can find the amount he spent on video games and Lego sets by subtracting the amount he had left from the total amount he got: $195 - $160 = $35.

Now, we know that he spent $35 on video games and Lego sets. We also know that he spent $160 on video games. To find out how much he spent on Lego sets, we subtract the cost of video games from the total amount he spent: $35 - $160 is incorrect, we need to subtract the cost of video games from the total amount he got: $195 - $160 = $35. Since he spent $35 on both video games and Lego sets, we can find the number of Lego sets he sold by dividing the amount he spent on Lego sets by the price of each set: $35 / $15 = 2.33. Since we can't sell a fraction of a Lego set, we round down to 2 sets.

However, we know John had 13 Lego sets initially. He sold 2 sets, so the number of Lego sets he still has is 13 - 2 = 11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find John's speed, we need to first calculate the total distance he runs in a week. 

He runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. So, the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles.

Now, let's calculate the distance he runs on each day:
- Day 1: 3 hours
- Day 2: 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Day 3: 1.5 hours

Total hours run in a week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his speed:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is her running speed multiplied by the time she spends running, which is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is her walking speed multiplied by the time she spends walking, which is 3 * 2 = 6 miles.

The total distance she travels is the sum of the distances she travels while running and walking, which is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"

When Polly throws the javelin with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone. 

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Remaining pieces = 14

Pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can find out how many grams per serving by dividing the total weight by the number of servings: 300g / 5 = 60g per serving.

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the weight per serving to find out how many grams you can eat: 0.8 servings * 60g/serving = 48g.

The final answer is 48."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
Number of candles made = 20
Price per candle = $2.00
Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
Cost per pound of beeswax and wicks = $10.00
Number of pounds of beeswax needed for 20 candles = 20 / 10
Number of pounds of beeswax needed = 2 pounds
Total cost = Number of pounds of beeswax * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20."
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles. 
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes an average of 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the ones she used and the ones she had left.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she used or had left is 80 + 23 = 103.

Now, we subtract the total number of Post-it notes she used or had left from the initial number to find the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased: 
80 + 23 = 103
103 - 103 = 0

However, this doesn't make sense because we know she bought a package of Post-it notes. So, let's re-evaluate the problem.

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 at work and had 23 left. This means she must have had 80 + 23 = 103 Post-it notes in total. 

Since she used 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased must be 220.

The final answer is: 220"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the blue tie, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + 50% of $40
= $40 + 0.5 * $40
= $40 + $20
= $60

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches
4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up for the remaining weight. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since the question asks for the amount earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as follows:

Patchy's kittens = 3 * Trixie's kittens
Patchy's kittens = 3 * 12
Patchy's kittens = 36

Now, we add the kittens from both cats to find the total number of kittens:

Total kittens = Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
Total kittens = 36 + 12
Total kittens = 48

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the number of lollipops left is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled:
28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of a movie outing and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single outing.

The total cost of a movie outing is the cost of the ticket plus the cost of the popcorn: $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, we divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14):

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total amount of the extra fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees become $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add it to the number of individual raspberries.

There are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 * 20 = 120.

Adding the 67 individual raspberries, the total number of raspberries is 120 + 67 = 187.

The total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 2 (sour) = 3 oranges

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the total number of unripe and bad/sour oranges from the total number of oranges: 
25 (total oranges) - 5 (unripe) - 3 (bad/sour) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total amount she receives in the first 20 years and the amount she receives in the remaining 10 years.

In the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. So, the total amount she receives in the first 20 years is:

$50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $1,000,000. So, the annual pension she receives after 20 years is:

$1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the fixed annual pension for 10 years and the 5% annual pension for 10 years. The total annual pension she receives is:

$50,000 (fixed pension) + $50,000 (5% pension) = $100,000

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $100,000.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid.
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she has already used (4 gallons) and then add the distance she has already traveled (100 miles).

First, let's calculate the remaining capacity of her tank:
12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons remaining

Now, we can calculate the total distance she can drive on a single tank:
8 gallons (remaining) * 25 miles per gallon (average miles per gallon) = 200 miles

However, since she has already traveled 100 miles, we need to add that to the total distance:
200 miles + 100 miles = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the hours spent on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV per week is 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on reading per week is 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

The total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers:

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the remaining days in the year.

In the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

The remaining days in the year are 365 - 180 = 185 days. After the first 180 days, Cecilia will feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we need to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each and 0 packages of 0 flowers (which is not possible).
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22. We can write this as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, the football team won 15 games.

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

The first time, the alarm rang for 4 times.
The second time, it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683
Salary after 10 years = $1414.7683 + $141.47683 = $1556.24513

The final answer is: $1556.25"
"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

The total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

8,000"
"To find out how many guests will attend, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of invited guests. 

3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12

Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, 12 guests will attend. 

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of gift bags. 

12 guests * $2 per gift bag = $24

The final answer is: $24"
"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount for adults and children separately.

Adults: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets the three have: 
4 (Cindy's pets) + 6 (Marcia's pets) + 18 (Jan's pets) = 28

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children.

We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Lastly, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time is x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

This means Gerald's original time was 36 seconds.

Now, we know Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6

Adding this to his original time:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. 

Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Total number of girls = 3/5 * 200 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

2/3 of 9 hours is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept to find the difference.

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the original 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes used by 3 to find the number of tomatoes. 

16 ounces / 3 = 5.33 tomatoes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 5

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first calculate the total number of potted plants she already has. 

She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she already has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She received 18 new potted plants yesterday, so the total number of potted plants she now has is 80 + 18 = 98.

She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which is 40 plants. 

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

Therefore, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he needs to read per day:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of water before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 14

Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, to cover 42 miles, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes. 

Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1/4 * 1000 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces on the board, which is 1/3 * 750 = 250 pieces.

Now, Poppy has 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he spent watching TV on other days.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours in total. On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute episodes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours of TV.

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV on these days: 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, we subtract the time spent watching TV on other days from the total: 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can divide 1.5 hours by 0.5 hours to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday: 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours = 3 episodes.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas without the rewards, and then subtract the rewards.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas without the rewards is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback rewards are $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the rewards from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first determine how many sets of 10 feet Julia rowed. Since the shore is 64 feet away and she rows 20 feet at a time, we can divide 64 by 20 to get 3.2 sets of 20 feet. However, since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round down to 3 sets of 20 feet.

Now, we know that for every 10 feet Julia rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. Since she rowed 3 sets of 20 feet, she rowed 60 feet. 

Since 60 feet is 6 sets of 10 feet, we can multiply 6 sets by 2 liters to get 12 liters of water taken on.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so we can write an equation: 
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 
So, we can write another equation: 
B = 50D

Now we can equate the two expressions for B:
300 = 50D

To find the number of ducks (D), we can divide both sides by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to calculate the new selling price. 
New selling price = $180 * 1.5 (100% + 50% increase) 
New selling price = $270

Now, we subtract the total cost from the new selling price to find the profit: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is 90."
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio. 

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part.

120 / 20 = 6

"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then calculate their current salaries.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)

To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can divide both sides by 1.3:
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Now that we know Lylah's salary four years ago, we can calculate her current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate her current salary as follows:
Lylah's current salary = Lylah's salary four years ago + 40% of Lylah's salary four years ago
Lylah's current salary = $30,769.23 + 0.4($30,769.23)
Lylah's current salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
Lylah's current salary = $43,076.92

Now that we know Adrien's salary four years ago ($40,000) and Lylah's current salary ($43,076.92), we can calculate their total salary four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
Number of letters with stamps = 1/3 * 60 = 20

Now, we know that the total number of letters with stamps is 30. To find the initial number of letters with stamps, we can subtract the number of letters with stamps Jennie put on from the total number of letters with stamps:

Initial number of letters with stamps = Total number of letters with stamps - Number of letters with stamps Jennie put on

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then she bought a package of 'x' spoons, so she had x spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2 spoons.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that the number of spoons she had after using 3 spoons to sample her stew is equal to 12. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 12

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To find the cost of each item, we need to first find the cost of a watermelon and an orange.

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45$.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the items Dillon wants to buy:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total time spent on patients and the total revenue from both the hospital and the patients.

Total time spent on patients: 
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from the hospital:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Total revenue from patients:
200 hours * $200 per hour = $40,000

Total revenue: $30,000 (hospital) + $40,000 (patients) = $70,000

Total cost: $30,000 (hospital) + $0 (since patients pay) = $30,000

Profit: $70,000 (revenue) - $30,000 (cost) = $40,000

The hospital makes a profit of $40,000."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the steps:

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
   Since there are 60 elves initially, 
   1/3 of 60 is 20. 
   So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   10 elves quit from the 40 remaining, leaving 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

"To find the total expenditure, we need to calculate the expenditure for May and June separately and then add them together.

Expenditure in May: $500
Expenditure in June: $500 - $60 = $440

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
Total expenditure = $500 + $440
Total expenditure = $940

The final answer is: 940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge separately and then add them together.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.
Pam rode the luge 2 times, so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the luge 2 times, so he used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.

Now, let's add the total number of tickets used:
12 (Pam's roller coaster tickets) + 24 (Fred's roller coaster tickets) + 12 (Pam's luge tickets) + 12 (Fred's luge tickets) = 60

The total number of tickets used that day is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles.

The total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total miles - Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
= 41 - 28
= 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the cost of each car wash and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Number of car washes per month: 4

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to first determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can set up the equation: 
Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find the total number of Scottish unicorns: 
   Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we multiply the total number of unicorns by 1/3.
   Total unicorns = 27
   Scottish unicorns = 27 * (1/3) = 9

2. Next, we find the number of female Scottish unicorns:
   Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.
   Female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"To find the total cost of Rory's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
The cost of 2 bags of chips is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
The cost of 2 cookies is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost of the order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we multiply the number of questions by the time taken: 
75 questions * 8 hours = 600 questions completed.

Since Mark completed 5 questions per hour, we can find the time taken for the second test by dividing the total questions by the rate:
100 questions / 5 questions per hour = 20 hours.

However, Mark only had 6 hours to complete the second test. So, he completed 5 questions per hour * 6 hours = 30 questions in the second test.

To find the total questions completed, we add the questions completed in both tests:
600 questions + 30 questions = 630 questions completed.

To find the total questions left incomplete, we subtract the total questions completed from the total questions:
75 questions + 100 questions = 175 questions.
175 questions - 630 questions = -455 questions.

Since Mark cannot leave a negative number of questions, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's recheck the time taken for the second test:
100 questions / 5 questions per hour = 20 hours. However, Mark only had 6 hours to complete the second test. This means he didn't complete the second test.

Since Mark completed 5 questions per hour * 8 hours = 40 questions in the first test, and 5 questions per hour * 6 hours = 30 questions in the second test, we can find the total questions left incomplete:
75 questions - 40 questions = 35 questions in the first test.
100 questions - 30 questions = 70 questions in the second test.
35 questions + 70 questions = 105 questions left incomplete.

The final answer is: 105"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first calculate four times the number of blue gumballs. 

Four times the number of blue gumballs = 4 * 12 = 48

Since there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, we add 22 to the result.

Number of pink gumballs = 48 + 22 = 70

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The final answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into the equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would work 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so in 14 hours, he would earn 14 * $10 = $140.

The total cost of the non-food items is: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
- Total non-food cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we need to calculate the tax on the non-food items. The tax rate is 10%, so we multiply the total non-food cost by 0.10:
- Tax on non-food items: $10 * 0.10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the total non-food cost:
- Total non-food cost with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the total food cost and the total non-food cost with tax to get the total cost:
- Total cost: $5 + $11 = $16

"To calculate Kim's profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses and total income.

Total income: Kim has 3 clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. 
Total bottles of bleach needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. The total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 30 + 60 = 90 bees.
5. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, 90 - 15 = 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between the time it takes for Tim to get home and the time it takes for Steve to get home.

Time Tim will be waiting: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries (as you can't eat a fraction of a fry).
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Now, to find the initial number of fries in the pack, we need to add the fries eaten by Dave, the seagull, the pigeons, the raccoon, and the ants to the remaining fries: 48 (eaten) + 5 (remaining) = 53 fries.

However, we need to account for the fries eaten by the seagull, which is 7 fries. So, the initial number of fries in the pack is 53 + 7 = 60 fries.

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 + 8 * 16 = 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 100 yards, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. 
She does this 34 times. 
100 yards + 80 yards = 180 yards per round
180 yards * 34 rounds = 6120 yards

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins the contest.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance.

Since one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can set up an equation to find the cost of the doll. 

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A and the cost of a red car as R. We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the cost of the doll is 3A.

We are also given that one red car costs $4, so R = $4.

Now, we can set up the equation: 3A = R
3A = 4

To find the cost of an action figure (A), we divide both sides by 3:
A = 4 / 3
A = $1.33

Now that we know the cost of an action figure, we can find the cost of the doll:
Cost of the doll = 3A
Cost of the doll = 3 * $1.33
Cost of the doll = $4

Now, we have the costs of all the toys:
- Red cars: $4 each
- Action figures: $1.33 each
- Doll: $4

To find the total cost of all toys, we add the costs of each toy:
Total cost = (5 * $4) + (3 * $1.33) + $4
Total cost = $20 + $4 + $4
Total cost = $28

The final answer is: $28"
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which would result in a loss of $35/hour. So, the total loss would be:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories.

The total cost of the accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

"To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs required for the Spanish flans by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Total eggs required for 15 flans = 15 * 3 = 45 eggs
Eggs received per babysitting job = 9

Number of babysitting jobs = Total eggs required / Eggs received per job
= 45 / 9
= 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can express this as S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into S = 2B, which gives us S = 2(8) = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has and then add $2.

Ethel has $8. Twice the amount of money Ethel has is 2 * 8 = 16.

Adding $2 to that amount, we get 16 + 2 = 18.

So, Jimmy has $18.

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles walked on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles per day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he walks 5 * 20 = 100 miles on weekdays.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

The hat costs $25.
The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.
The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform:
$25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs from each group and add them together.

Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs
Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs

Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The final answer is: 1210"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and we still need to find the age of the fourth bird.

Since the problem doesn't mention the age of the fourth bird, we can't determine its age. However, based on the given information, we can calculate the total age of the three birds we know: 8 + 19 + 16 = 43.

The total age of the four birds is unknown without the age of the fourth bird."
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment: 
$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, we add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds = 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes (converting 5 seconds to minutes) = 1.5833 minutes

Now, we multiply the time to prepare one potato by the total number of potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes

Converting the result to a more understandable format, we get approximately 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 * 20 (gallons) - Cost = $25

Let's simplify the equation:
$200 - Cost = $25

Now, we can solve for the cost:
Cost = $200 - $25
Cost = $175

However, this is the total cost for lemons and sugar. We need to find the cost of lemons only. The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, and they made 20 gallons. So, the cost of sugar is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, we can find the cost of lemons:
Cost of lemons = Total cost - Cost of sugar
Cost of lemons = $175 - $40
Cost of lemons = $135

The final answer is: $135"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to first find the total number of Chinese participants. 

We know that there are 80 Japanese participants and a total of 240 participants. 

The number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160.

We also know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Total Chinese participants - Number of boys

"To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 0.25 * 6000 = 1500

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
   1/3 of 6000 = 0.33 * 6000 = 2000

3. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
   6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

4. Calculate the amount donated to charity:
   Half of 2500 = 0.5 * 2500 = 1250

5. Calculate the remaining amount after charity donation:
   2500 - 1250 = 1250

6. Calculate the total amount spent on his daughter and wife:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crabs each person has.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs.

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
$10/hour * 5 hours = $50

For the second week, Lloyd earned $10 per hour and tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
$10/hour * 8 hours = $80

Now, we add the earnings for both weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of students who voted (80) by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = 80 * (3/4) = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years.
   - Mark was 5 years older than that, so Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.
   - Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so Mark's current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.
3. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team's time is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of two events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2), since the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event (rolling a number less than or equal to 3) on the first roll, which is 3/6.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll, given that the first roll was less than or equal to 3, is 3/6 = 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, given that the first roll was even, is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row as:

P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = P(rolling an even number on the first roll) * P(rolling an even number on the second roll | rolling an even number on the first roll)
= (1/2) * (1/4)
= 1/8

Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3) = 1 - P(rolling a number less than or equal to 3)
= 1 - 1/2
= 1/2

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

P(rolling a number greater than 3) - P(rolling two even numbers in a row)
= 1/2 - 1/8
= 3/8

To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

(3/8) * 100 = 37.5%

The final answer is: 37.5"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first find out how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's apples as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

"To find the total number of straw pieces used for the rats, we need to subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used. 

First, let's calculate the total straw used for the hamsters: 
10 cages of hamsters * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw

Next, let's calculate the total straw used for the rabbits: 
20 pieces of straw

Now, let's subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 
160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the remaining straw by 6 to find the number of rats: 
90 / 6 = 15

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the number of rats by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage: 
15 / 3 = 5

"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the debt after 3 months, we need to multiply the interest for one month by 3.

Total interest = Interest for one month * 3
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the transportation cost:
Total cost = Total cost + Transportation cost
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, let's find the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total revenue - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

However, this is the total number of bags bought and sold. Since the trader sold 13 bags, we need to subtract 13 from the total number of bags bought to find the number of bags bought:
Number of bags bought = 114 - 13
Number of bags bought = 101

Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom plants and chops down each year, and then subtract the total number of trees that die after 10 years.

Tom plants 10 trees per year and chops down 2 trees per year, so the net gain of trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees. After 10 years, he has planted 10 * 10 = 100 new trees. However, 30% of the total trees (including the original 50 trees) die.

First, we need to calculate the total number of trees after 10 years. We add the original 50 trees to the 100 new trees: 50 + 100 = 150 trees.

Then, we calculate 30% of the total trees: 30% of 150 = 0.3 * 150 = 45 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 150 - 45 = 105 trees.

So, Tom has 105 trees left after 10 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

Then, they painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to first calculate the total number of pounds of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.

There are 40 restaurants, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Since there are 200 pounds of carrots in total, we can find the number of pounds that will not be used by subtracting the total pounds distributed from the total pounds available.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots distributed
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120 pounds

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has:
20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we can multiply the number of sentences by the rate to find the amount Mark earns from Publisher A.

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can multiply the amount Mark earns from Publisher A by 2 to find the amount he earns from Publisher B.

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amounts he earns from both publishers.

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the amount of water he gets in the morning and the amount he gets in the afternoon, then add them together.

In the morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the morning is 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters.

In the afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water, and each pail contains 5 liters. So, the amount of water he gets in the afternoon is 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters.

Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his earnings before the award and then add the award amount.

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award. Since he makes $2000 per week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings before the award would be:

$2000 per week * 52 weeks per year = $104,000 per year

Now, let's add the award amount of $5000 to his total earnings:

$104,000 + $5000 = $105,000

Additionally, he received a 5% raise in salary. To calculate the raise amount, we multiply his original salary by the raise percentage:

$2000 * 0.05 = $100

Now, we add the raise amount to his original salary:

$2000 + $100 = $2100

Since the raise is applied to his new salary, we need to calculate his new salary:

$2100 per week * 52 weeks per year = $109,800 per year

Now, we add the award amount to his new salary:

$109,800 + $5000 = $110,800

So, John's total earnings for the year would be $110,800.

Final answer: $110,800"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre and then multiply that by the number of barrels produced per ton.

First, we multiply the number of acres by the number of tons produced per acre: 
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total tons by the number of barrels produced per ton: 
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each type and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue pens:
6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens:
2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add the number of pens Janet had initially to the number of pens she bought:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens = 32 pens
32 pens + 54 blue pens = 86 pens
86 pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the required score, we need to first find the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. 

Since there are 6 tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first five tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs, we subtract the lowest score from the required total score: 558 - 71 = 487.

Now, we subtract the sum of the remaining scores from the total score Brinley needs: 487 - 358 = 129.

This means Brinley needs a score of 129 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks.

In the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week, 25 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks is:
5 * 25 * 4 = 500 kilometers

In the last three weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, 60 kilometers each time. So, the total kilometers he rode in the last three weeks is:
2 * 60 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Now, we add the total kilometers he rode in the first four weeks and the last three weeks to find the total kilometers he rode in total:
500 + 360 = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: 2600"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

The final answer is: 76"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $40, we can divide $40 by $5, which is 8 sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. Since she earns $4 per session, we can divide $40 by $4, which is 10 sessions.

Since 8 babysitting sessions would not be enough to cover the total amount, we need to find the least common multiple of 8 and 10. The least common multiple of 8 and 10 is 40.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times to earn $40.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs collected per day is 3r + 5w.

We are given that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42. So, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around its edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed.

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the total amount of water lost from both pools in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16. We know this is equal to y, so we can set up another equation:

x - 16 = y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by substituting the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
-2x = -48
x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the equations:

y = x - 16
y = 24 - 16
y = 8

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.
So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She will pay $165 per month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to return:
$2200 - $1980 = $220.

Janeth's remaining balance will be $220."

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Now, since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages in three years and divide by 3.

In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24
In three years, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45
In three years, Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66

Average age in three years = (Harriet's age + Zack's age + Adrian's age) / 3
Average age in three years = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age in three years = 135 / 3
Average age in three years = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54.

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest, so we need to find 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially. 

Now, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. 

To find the number of melons that were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of melons ready for harvest from the total remaining melons.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, and he writes 6 letters per week. So, he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 7 = 420 minutes in a week.

Now, we can divide the total number of pages he writes per week (30) by the number of minutes he spends writing per page (6). This gives us 30 / 6 = 5 pages per minute.

Now, we can multiply the number of pages he writes per minute (5) by the number of minutes in a week (420) to find the total number of minutes he spends writing per week. This gives us 5 * 420 = 2100 minutes.

To convert the total number of minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 2100 / 60 = 35 hours.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used and the extra minutes from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes - 450 minutes - 300 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many she gave. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave 'x'. After Ginger gave her fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that Griffin had 27 fries in the end. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7, x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 14"
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

Total hours worked per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total amount before discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Discount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total.

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Calories difference = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:
Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first two classes
= 30 - (15 + 12)
= 30 - 27
= 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the third class from the total number of boys:
Boys in the third class = Total boys - Girls in the third class
= 30 - 3
= 27 boys

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

We also know that he killed three fewer cougars today than last night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals Rick killed: 25 + 57 = 82 animals

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is 84."
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 20 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 20
= 2 cows

Now, we know that each stall initially had 20 cows and 2 cows were added to each stall. 

Number of cows in each stall after adding 2 cows = Initial cows + Added cows
= 20 + 2
= 22 cows

Since we want to know the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8.

Number of cows in 8 stalls = 22 * 8

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to first find the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate into it. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the redwood (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 
200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of 8000 pounds:
30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52:
Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas:
Total fruits = 52 (Andrea's apples) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) = 124

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2.

3. Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

4. The second scene has six more lines than the song. So, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.

5. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize in the second scene is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. Since we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, let's denote Mico's age as 'x' and Marco's age as '20 - x'. 

We can set up an equation: x + (20 - x) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get: 
20 = 20

This equation is true for any value of x, which means Mico and Marco are either the same age or one of them is 10 years old and the other is 10 years old.

Now, let's consider the case where Mico is 10 years old and Marco is 10 years old. In 10 years, Mico will be 20 years old and Marco will be 20 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

There are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, so the total length of the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches. 

Now, subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to divide the remaining space by the length of each bead to find the number of beads used. 

17 / 0.25 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The remaining stars are 76 - (24 + 12) = 40. 

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars. 
40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the flagstones, we need to multiply the number of flagstones by their individual weight.

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight per flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

The customer will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals given out for counting as 'x'. Since Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that 39 is 10 times less than 'x'. We can write this as an equation:

39 = 10x/10

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 10:

39 * 10 = x
390 = x

So, the number of medals given out for counting is 390.

Final answer: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. 

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8: 16 / 8 = 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she works:
- She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours.
- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.
- However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works.
- 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Now, let's calculate her earnings:
- She earns $5 every 10 minutes.
- To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10, which equals 15.
- Multiply the number of intervals by her hourly wage: 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is $75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike's points: 21 points
- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18 points
- Tony's points: 21 * 2 = 42 points

Now, let's check if each player has over 20 points. 
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim's points: 18 points
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add the points of all three players:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to first determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges. 
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 
The youngest son washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity for each day and then add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the counts for each activity over the two days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last: 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the number of crates he sold on each day.

On Monday and Friday, he was closed, so he didn't sell any crates.
On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
On the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Since his target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, and she bids after each of the 3 other people. This means she bids 4 times. 

The first bid is $200. 
The second bid is $200 + $50 = $250. 
The third bid is $250 + $50 = $300. 
The fourth bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

Since she wins after the fourth bid, the total amount she paid for the desk is $350.

Final answer: $350"
"To find the total distance John drives in a year, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

Distance to work and back is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.
Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.
Since he works for 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of driving:
Cost per mile = $2
Total miles driven per year = 15,000 miles
Total cost of driving per year = 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus he pays is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Total cost per year = Total cost of driving per year + Total bonus per year
Total cost per year = $30,000 + $1,800
Total cost per year = $31,800

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find out how many minutes he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. 

On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes. 
On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes. 
So, the total minutes he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the total minutes by 2. 
2 * 39 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the paper. 

In this case, we have two sides: the left side and the right side. 

- The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each piece of paper is used for both sides, we need 2 pieces of paper for each set of 16 pages. 

So, for the left side, we need 16 pieces of paper. 
For the right side, we also need 16 pieces of paper.

In total, we need 16 + 16 = 32 pieces of paper.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first calculate how much she spent. 

She spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. 

So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35. 

To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final amount of money Annika has left is $15."
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, in the first year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year, she sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Now, we know that each book sells at 20$. So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: 2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his regular earnings and the bonus.

Watson works 5 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. So, he works a total of 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 20 days in April.

His regular earnings for April would be 20 days * $10/hour = $200.

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus. 

So, his total earnings for April would be $200 (regular earnings) + $300 (bonus) = $500.

Final answer: $500"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20 * 0.2 (since 80% is equivalent to 0.8).

"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves is (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
   Half of the remaining loaves is (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find the weight loss per week.

Weight loss per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds per week. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we can divide the total weight by the weight loss per week.

Total weight = 8 pounds
Weight loss per week = 2 pounds

Number of weeks = Total weight / Weight loss per week
= 8 pounds / 2 pounds
= 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in 15 days.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, in 15 days, they will grow 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs the person will grow is 5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract the total cost from the amount he has: 
$6000 - $1950 = $4050

So, Theo has $4050 left to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

Final answer: $4050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.

Three people eat three eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
Two people eat two eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

Six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We can substitute C = 46 into this equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we know Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile six years ago. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so:

Population six years ago = 3000N
Population six years ago = 3000(26)
Population six years ago = 78000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, we can set up the equation:

Population six years ago = (1/2)Population now
78000 = (1/2)P
P = 2 * 78000
P = 156000

The population of Chile now is 156000."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, so we need to find 1/4 of 8. 1/4 of 8 is 2. We subtract 2 from the number of people who could come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Since his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and Solomon bought 20 marbles, we can calculate this as follows:
   2/5 * 20 = 8

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles.

2. Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. We already know that Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 8 marbles. Adding these together, we get:
   20 + 8 = 28

3. Now, we know that the store initially had 50 marbles. Adding the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him, we get:
   50 + 28 = 78

4. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we can calculate the total weight of marbles by multiplying the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:
   78 * 2 = 156

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156kgs."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply its length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation: 
3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women. 

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7 women.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so let's first find out how many pencils are in the boxes. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

The total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2. We know that this total is 26. So, we can set up the equation: 3x + 2 = 26.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 24.

Then, we divide both sides by 3: x = 8.

Now that we know the number of pencils in each box is 8, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has: 3x + 2 = 3(8) + 2 = 26.

Now, let's add the pencils Jam and Meg have: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72.

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 72 / 8 = 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes needed to achieve this cooling effect. 

Number of ice cubes = Total cooling effect / Cooling effect per ice cube
= 65 / 13
= 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:
Total weakening effect of ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakening effect per ice cube
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. This will directly weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Total weakening effect of cream = 15 milliliters

The total weakening effect of the iced coffee is the sum of the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream:
Total weakening effect = Total weakening effect of ice cubes + Total weakening effect of cream
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of new records the 5 people received. We know that they left with 7 new records.

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say the total number of old records the 5 people brought in is x.

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x. However, this is equal to the total number of new records received, which is 7. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2x = 7

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 7 / 2
x = 3.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't simply round down because the number of old records must be a multiple of 2 (since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record). 

Let's re-examine the situation. If 5 people trade 2 old records each for 7 new records, then the total number of old records must be a multiple of 5 (since there are 5 people). 

Let's try 10 old records. If 5 people trade 2 old records each for 7 new records, then the total number of old records is indeed 10.

So, the 5 people brought in 10 old records.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees after subtracting the number of junior programmers: 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

First, let's calculate the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal. We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 more got on at the second stop. So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we know that 7 people got off at the second stop. To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to add the number of people who got on at the first stop and the number of people who got on at the second stop, and then subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop.

So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 13 + 7 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to recharge 40% as follows:

40% / 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes = 40 / 1 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so now Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they received and subtract that from the total amount they spent.

The customer spent $80 and received $1 off for every $20 spent. Since $80 is 4 times $20, they received 4 rewards. 

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the rewards they received were halved. 

The customer received 4 rewards, but they were halved, so they received 4 / 2 = 2 rewards. 

The rewards they received were worth $1 each, so they received 2 * $1 = $2 off.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: $80 - $2 = $78.

The customer paid $78 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for each job, we need to calculate the total income and subtract the taxes.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Total income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay of both jobs, Job B has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220 and then divide that number by 2.

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we divide 88 by 2:

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Final answer: 44"
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value of each share after the price increase and decrease.

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
New value of each share after the first year: $8 + $4 = $12

Decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New value of each share after the second year: $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is:
8 shares * $9 per share = $72

Final value of Maria's shares: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

So, the smallest group has 40 students.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. We know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's represent the number of cows as 'x'. Then, the number of chickens will be 2x.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60.

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can find the number of chickens: 2x = 2 * 20 = 40

Now that we know the number of chickens (40) and cows (20), we can calculate the total number of legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of chicken legs is 40 * 2 = 80.

Cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of cow legs is 20 * 4 = 80.

The total number of legs is 80 (chicken legs) + 80 (cow legs) = 160.

The final answer is: 160"

Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week. 
- Week 1: 3 balls
- Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
- Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
- Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since Josh dropped 3 balls, but 2 were caught, he lost 1 ball. So, he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls left."
"To find the weight of each animal, we can use the given information:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
Container weight: 20 pounds
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds
Green toad: 50 pounds
Yellow snake: 60 pounds
Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight = 20 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 210 pounds

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirts is 2 * $30 = $60.

"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Revenue from tractors: 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day
Revenue from silos: 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

The difference in revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100/day

To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100.

Percentage increase = (100 / 1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find the total monthly cost, we need to calculate the weekly cost of food and multiply it by 4, then add the monthly cost of treats and medicine.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will also need to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. We know that the total cost of the activities is $30, and we want to find out how many friends she can invite. Let's assume the cost per person is x. Then, the total cost of the activities for n friends will be $30n.

Since the total budget is $60, we can set up the equation: $30n = $60.

To solve for n, we divide both sides by $30: n = $60 / $30 = 2.

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5

Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs and $2 on gumballs, so the amount of money he spent on candy is $10 - $8 = $2.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the total amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought: $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

The final answer is: 1.33"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's son's age as 'x'. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

To find out how many days it takes for the train to travel 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by 675.

18,000 / 675 = 26.67 days.

So, the train needs service every 26.67 days."

Next, we add the detour distance:
Detour distance = 10 miles
Total distance to his friend's house = 200 + 10 = 210 miles

Time taken to drive to his friend's house = 210 / 70 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the time taken to drive back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to drive to his friend's house + Time taken to drive back home

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. We are given that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, so 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x (refusing to wear masks) + (3x - 5) (shoplifting) + 3(3x - 5) (physical violence) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since you can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Shoplifting: 3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10
Physical violence: 3(3x - 5) = 3(10) = 30

Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is 5."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Sara had x points before. 
Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, Erin had 3x points before.

We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14 + 8 (since Sara scored 8 points)

Combine like terms:
3x = 22

Now, divide both sides by 3:
x = 22 / 3
x = 7.33

So, Sara had approximately 7.33 points before. 

Since Erin had 3 times more points than Sara, Erin had 3 * 7.33 = 22.99 points before.

The final answer is 22.99."

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the cost of the materials first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. Since Ethan saves 20% by making his own, the cost of the materials will be 80% of the original cost.

Materials cost = 80% of $400
Materials cost = 0.8 * $400
Materials cost = $320

Now, we need to add the cost of the materials to the cost of the materials to find the total cost.

Total cost = Materials cost + Original cost
Total cost = $320 + $400
Total cost = $720

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $720."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice per week, we need to calculate the total hours for each day and then add them together.

On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of practice.
On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of practice.

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces of equipment is x.

Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The total amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on faulty pieces, which is $400,000 - 0.4x.

However, we are given that the total amount spent is $400,000. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 0.6x (since 100% - 40% = 60%)

Now, we can solve for x:

0.4x = 0.6x
0.6x - 0.4x = 0
0.2x = 0
x = 0 / 0.2
x = 0

This means that the total number of pieces of equipment is 0, which doesn't make sense in this context. However, we can re-evaluate the problem.

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. The amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x, and the amount spent on functioning pieces is 0.6x.

Since the total amount spent is $400,000, we can set up the equation:

0.4x + 0.6x = 400,000

Combine like terms:

1x = 400,000

Divide both sides by 1:

x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of faulty pieces:

Number of faulty pieces = 0.4x
= 0.4 * 400,000
= 160,000

Now, we can find the amount spent on functioning pieces:

Amount spent on functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep and then add them together.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, she has 15 sheep in each half. 

She gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, she gets 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk from the first half.

She gets 2 kg of milk from the other half of the sheep, which is also 15 sheep. So, she gets 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk from the second half.

Now, we add the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount of money she made ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, and she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of apples picked each day: 
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of pairs and the number of loose socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 40 more gold pesos, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total amount of silver and gold they have together:
Total silver = 50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150
Total gold = 80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350.

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18 (profit)

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: 
$18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

We can set up the equation as follows:
(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the initial number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir has an equal number of boys and girls, there are also 26 boys. 

The total number of people initially is 26 (girls) + 26 (boys) = 52.

Half of the people can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 

The number of people who can perform is 52 - 26 = 26.

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them, so we need to add 3 to the number of people who can perform. 

The total number of people who sang in the performance is 26 + 3 = 29.

The final answer is 29."

"To determine how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of buying 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of buying a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. Therefore, he saves $18 - $30 = -$12. However, since you can't save a negative amount, we need to consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective.

Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, which costs 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18. David buys a ride bracelet for $30. 

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find the total number of parts in the ratio, we add 5 + 6 = 11. 

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we divide 165 by 11 to find the value of each part: 165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Now, we multiply the value of each part by the number of parts for each person: 
Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how much Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services he chooses.

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month for both services.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Now, let's calculate the monthly savings by canceling the cable subscription. 
Monthly savings = Cost of cable subscription - Total cost of streaming services
Monthly savings = $60 - $18
Monthly savings = $42

So, Tim saves $42 per month by canceling his cable subscription."

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she gave away, and the number of cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she initially had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, the total number of cards she gave away is 24 + 5 = 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards she has after giving away 29 cards. She initially had 50 cards and gave away 29, so she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

Then, she received 17 cards from family and friends. So, the total number of cards she now has is 21 + 17 = 38.

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To find out how many slices Jenny has initially, we need to add the fractions of the pizza she gave to Bill and Mark. 

First, we need to find a common denominator for 3 and 4, which is 12. 

1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we can add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, and she eats 2 slices, we need to subtract 2 from 7/12. 

To subtract 2 from 7/12, we can convert 2 to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
2 = 24/12

Now, we can subtract:
7/12 - 24/12 = -17/12

Since we can't have a negative number of slices, we can convert -17/12 to a mixed number:
-17/12 = -1 7/12

So, there is 1 slice left.

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the daily energy usage is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

In 30 days, the total energy usage would be 7200 Wh/day * 30 days = 216,000 Wh.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we can convert the total energy usage to kilowatts by dividing by 1000:

216,000 Wh / 1000 = 216 kWh

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily energy usage would be 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day.

In 30 days, the new total energy usage would be 2700 Wh/day * 30 days = 81,000 Wh.

The energy saved is the difference between the original and new energy usage:

216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh

To convert the energy saved to kilowatts, we divide by 1000:

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required for 20 people.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:

- 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's say the number of corns is x. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can write the equation as:

x = 2 * 40
x = 80

So, Allan has 80 corns.

We also know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

40 (initial cannolis) + 60 (new cannolis) = 100 cannolis

We are also told that he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, we can set up an equation to find the number of corns:

Let's say the number of corns is y. Since he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, we can write the equation as:

y = 100 - 40
y = 60

However, we already know that the number of corns is 80. This means that the information about buying 40 fewer corns is incorrect, and we can ignore it.

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Total = 80 (corns) + 100 (cannolis)
Total = 180

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
Total hours worked in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/week = 1600 hours
Total amount paid in May = 1600 hours * $15/hour = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees.
Total hours worked in June = 30 employees * 40 hours/week = 1200 hours
Total amount paid in June = 1200 hours * $15/hour = $18,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). 
$1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. 
$960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies her recipe makes (12). 

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the number of candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog) and then find 1% of that number, since 1% of the defective candles will explode.

First, we find the number of defective candles (smell like wet dog):
5% of 50000 candles = 0.05 * 50000 = 2500 candles

Then, we find 1% of the defective candles (will explode):
1% of 2500 candles = 0.01 * 2500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discounted price of one blouse and then multiply it by 4.

The regular price of one blouse is $20. Since the blouses are 30% off, we need to find 30% of $20 and subtract it from $20.

30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

Discounted price of one blouse = $20 - $6 = $14

Now, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost of 4 blouses:

Total cost = $14 * 4 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + 15 + 45 = 3x + 60.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60) = 440 - 3x.

Since Joanne gathers apples from the average trees, the number of apples she gathers from the average trees is 440 - 3x.

However, we know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. So, the number of apples she gathers from the average trees is 30 + (440 - 3x) = 470 - 3x.

Since the problem states that Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than from the tallest trees, we can set up the inequality 470 - 3x > 30.

Simplifying the inequality, we get 440 - 3x > 0.

Solving for x, we get 3x < 440, and x < 146.67.

Since x must be a whole number, the maximum value of x is 146.

Now, we can find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees: 470 - 3x = 470 - 3(146) = 470 - 438 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation:
C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have 2 bumps each and dromedaries have 1 bump each, we can write the equation:
2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:
C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance covered in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, we add the distances covered in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

Therefore, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
5 = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To find Zack's locker size, we multiply both sides by 4:

Zack's locker = 5 * 4
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size since it's half as big as Zack's locker:

Timothy's locker = 1/2 * Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 1/2 * 20
Timothy's locker = 10 cubic inches

"To find the distance Oliver must climb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's current elevation.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. 

The difference in elevation is 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet.

So, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount of capital he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000

Total capital = Initial capital + Amount received from the first bank + Amount received from the second bank
Total capital = $5000 + $4000 + $8000
Total capital = $14,000

The final answer is: 14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we calculate the number of cats taken away by the boats: 4 boats * 5 cats per boat = 20 cats.
2. Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
3. Next, we calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats: 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.
4. Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

There were 12 cats left on the rock."
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into three periods: the first 6 months, the next 8 months, and the last 20 months.

1. The first 6 months: 6 months * $8/month = $48
2. The next 8 months: 8 months * $12/month = $96
3. The last 20 months: 20 months * $14/month = $280

Now, we add the costs of all three periods: $48 + $96 + $280 = $424

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $424."
"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the total savings from the jogger jeans. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, the remaining 2/3 of the savings must have come from the tattered jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. The total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the sale price of the jogger jeans. The sale price of the jogger jeans is $28 - $6 = $22. 

The total savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 * ($x - $22). The total savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 * $6. 

Since the total savings is $6, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * ($x - $22) + 2/3 * $6 = $6

Simplifying the equation, we get:
1/3 * ($x - $22) + $4 = $6
1/3 * ($x - $22) = $2
$x - $22 = $6
$x = $28

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $28, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28 + $6 = $34.

The difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $34 - $28 = $6.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each: 4 x 60 = 240 employees
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each: 6 x 30 = 180 employees
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each: 10 x 15 = 150 employees

Now, let's add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees

Therefore, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts. 

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds. The total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Kenny has in total. We know that he has $50 in spending cash and he also gets to keep 1/3 of his cards, which he can use to buy the ticket. Since the ticket costs $100, the amount he gets from selling his cards must be $100 + $50 = $150.

Since he sells each card for $1.5, we can divide the total amount he gets from selling his cards ($150) by the price of each card ($1.5) to find the total number of cards he sold:

$150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

Since he kept 1/3 of his cards, the number of cards he kept is 1/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. Then, the number of cards he kept is x/3.

We know that the number of cards he sold is 100, so the number of cards he kept is x - 100. We can set up the equation:

x/3 = x - 100

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3:

x = 3x - 300

Subtracting 3x from both sides:

-2x = -300

Dividing both sides by -2:

x = 150

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs as follows:

36 guests * 1.5 (since half of the guests get two hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is:

40 guests * 2 hotdogs per guest = 80 hotdogs

Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, we can calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog as follows:

80 hotdogs needed - 54 hotdogs prepared = 26 hotdogs

Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, we can divide the number of hotdogs by 2 to find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:

26 hotdogs / 2 hotdogs per guest = 13 guests

Therefore, 13 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

   - Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the 20% discount:
   20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

3. Calculate the final cost after the discount:
   Final cost = Total cost - Discount

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dragons each prince slew and then determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons.

1/4 of 15 gallons = 15 * 1/4 = 15/4 = 3.75 gallons

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3.75 gallons to pints.

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints

Josey needed 30 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, the total amount spent on chips is 3 * 40 = 120 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can assume that 1% of his total money is 1 cent. This means he spent 99% of his money, which is 99 cents.

Now, we know that George spent 120 cents on chips and 99 cents on candy bars. The total amount he spent is 120 + 99 = 219 cents.

Since George spent 5 dollars, we can convert this to cents: 5 * 100 = 500 cents.

Now, we can find out how much money George had initially: 500 - 219 = 281 cents.

Since George had 1% of his money left, we can find the initial amount of money he had: 281 * 100 = 28.1 dollars.

Now, we can find out how many candy bars George bought: 28.1 - 3 * 0.40 = 28.1 - 1.2 = 26.9. 

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to 26 candy bars.

The final answer is 26."

Ray had 25 lollipops initially and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then find out how much earlier she should leave.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, we need to add the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater to the time she wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. So, the total time she should leave is 16 + 5 = 21 minutes.

Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette should leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length * Width

We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (9 feet), so we can plug in the values and solve for the width:

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window. The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open, and it's open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the window is 2 * (30/10) = 6 degrees.

Now, we need to add the temperature increase due to the oven and subtract the temperature decrease due to the window. The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. 

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase due to oven - Temperature decrease due to window
Final temperature = 40 + 15 - 6
Final temperature = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time.
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes = 1 hour 25 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim time and bike time, and we know Jon won by 10 minutes. This means James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting James' swim time and bike time from James' total time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of the popcorn as P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of buying a super ticket.

The cost of a super ticket is $20, and you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the total cost of a super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 (movie ticket) + P (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = $15 + P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:

$15 + P = $21

Subtracting $15 from both sides of the equation gives us:

P = $6

So, the regular price of popcorn is $6.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost of filling one balloon. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. So, the cost of filling one balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

After the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons: $65 * 170 = $11,100.

The final answer is 11,100."
"To find the average speed of the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average speed = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten, we need to multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

Marin eats 4 apples per day, and Nancy eats 4 apples per day. 

Total apples eaten per day = 4 (Marin) + 4 (Nancy) = 8 apples per day

Total apples eaten in 30 days = 8 apples per day * 30 days = 240 apples

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to calculate the volume of one bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

The cost of the potting soil is $12 per bag, so the total cost will be 160 * $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of the number of red cards and add it to the number of red cards.

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new ones) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12).

- Forty-two 75-pound bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Twenty 65-pound sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips: 4400 / 2250 = 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles per week.

Earnings from aluminum cans per week: 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents
Earnings from plastic bottles per week: 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents

Total earnings per week: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9. 

Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 = 0.10 * 10 = $1.

Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The shark's body length is 10 feet, and the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the shark's body length and multiply by 100:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To find the total number of students, we can start by using the information that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Let's represent the total number of students as 'x'. 

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x. The remaining students without a desktop computer would be (1/4)x. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two substances.

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 kids are allergic to peanuts. However, 3 kids are allergic to both. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the total number of kids allergic to each substance.

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to at least one substance

"To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors.

Since the razors come 4 to a pack, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

The original price of 2 packs is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, we can consider the cost of 2 packs as the cost of 4 razors. So, the effective cost of 8 razors is $8.00.

Now, we need to subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost. $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Since there are 8 razors, we need to divide the total cost by 8 to find the cost of each individual razor. $6.00 / 8 = $0.75.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, we add the yards used by both: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The total yards of yarn used is 273."
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts for each group of friends and then add them together.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 2 x 5 = 10.

For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 3 x 2 = 6.

Adding the gifts for both groups together, we get 10 + 6 = 16.

Then, Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26.

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to this, we get 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The length of the couch is 18 feet."
"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first calculate the total amount Suzie paid for the grape and green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half of that, which is $1, for a pack of green apple gum. So, the total amount she paid for these two packs is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie paid $7 in total, the amount she paid for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

For 2 x 4 lumber:
Cost per stick = Total cost / Total sticks
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 lumber:
Cost per stick = Total cost / Total sticks
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.015 per stick

Since 2 x 8 lumber is cheaper per stick, Frederick should buy 2 x 8 lumber. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of sticks he can make with $24:
Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6
Number of 2 x 8 lumber = 4

Total sticks = Number of 2 x 8 lumber * Total sticks per 2 x 8 lumber
Total sticks = 4 * 400
Total sticks = 1600

The final answer is 1600."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the cost of a pair of snowshoes and then multiply by 2 since each dog has two snowshoes.

Number of dogs: 6
Cost per pair of snowshoes: $12.00
Total cost per dog: 6 * $12.00 = $72.00
Total cost for all dogs: $72.00 * 6 = $432.00

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $432.00."
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2 per week.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cows and sheep each place has.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places: 
30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120

The total number of animals is 120."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4, since Rose bought 4 times the number of each item Sophia bought.

Onions: 12 / 4 = 3
Potatoes: 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

3 + 1 = 4"
"To find the calorie deficit Andy needs, we first need to calculate the number of days he has to reach his goal. 

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. 

July has 31 days, and December has 31 days. So, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
31 (July) + 31 (December) + 6 (January) + 6 (February) + 3 (March) + 31 (April) + 30 (May) + 31 (June) = 205 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and he needs to burn 3500 calories per pound, the total calories he needs to burn is:
30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to burn by the number of days:
105,000 calories / 205 days ≈ 512 calories/day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 512 calories to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. In a week, he would earn 7 * $30 = $210.

However, he spent $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned: $210 - $100 = $110.

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000

The final answer is 90,000."
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 
8 packs * $4 per pack = $32

Tara sold each bag for $8. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of bags by the selling price per bag:
8 bags * $8 per bag = $64

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies, which is two times more than Josh's cookies:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20) = $40 + $120 = $160.

2. Ali gives half of the total money to his sister: 
   Half of $160 = $160 / 2 = $80. 
   Remaining money = $160 - $80 = $80.

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner: 
   3/5 of $80 = (3/5) * $80 = $48. 
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32.

"To find the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we need to first find the time it takes Rob to shingle a house. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. So, we need to find double the time it takes Rob and add 40 minutes.

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes
Time it takes Royce = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each person can pick and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

Future weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours per week
Future weekly bill: 98 kilowatt-hours per week * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $147 per week

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1/2 house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the individual rate:

Combined rate = 5 * (1/10) = 1/2 house per day

Since they need to paint a whole house, we can calculate the time it would take for 5 people to paint the house as follows:

Time = 1 house / (1/2 house per day) = 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the time to hours:

Time (in hours) = 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. 

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. 

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs. 

We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, the number of chairs Ophelia has is 2 more than the number of sofas she has. 

20 (number of sofas) + 2 = x (number of chairs)

x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has. 

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have. 

Total number of sofas = 20
Total number of chairs = 22 + 66 = 88

Total number of sofas and chairs = 20 + 88 = 108

The final answer is: 108"

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. However, it is stated that 3 times fewer passengers get on, so we need to subtract 3 times the number who got off from the number who got on. So, 63 - 3 * 21 = 63 - 63 = 0. 

The number of passengers after the second stop is 59."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 5 = x + 10 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

10 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

5 = x

So, Jame's current age is 5 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be x + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 years old. 

Since Jame is 5 years old now, his cousin is 15 - 5 = 10 years old now.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:
Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the two monitors:
Cost of two monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Cost of two monitors = $2,400 - $700
Cost of two monitors = $1,700

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of two monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of two monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

The final answer is: $850"
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 is 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the 20% tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

So, you ended up paying $30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total target by 30 to find the daily savings for the first half of the month.

Daily savings for the first half of the month = $1125 / 15 (15 days in the first half of April) = $75

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

Daily savings for the second half of the month = $75 * 2 = $150

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $150 per day in the second half of the month to hit his target."

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, we multiply x by 4:

Jeff's amount = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the total distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Total distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked in a week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down her actions:

1. She writes the alphabet twice, which is 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.
2. She writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters.
3. She re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 letters (from step 1) + 13 letters (from step 2) = 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families. 
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families. 
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 toys.

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost, which is 0.10 * $20 = $2
The total cost after the discount is $20 - $2 = $18

Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20
The cost of potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3
The cost of fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10

Total cost: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the remaining $1500.

For the first $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 * $1000 = $300.

For the remaining $1500, the commission is 10% of $1500, which is 0.1 * $1500 = $150.

Now, we add the two commissions together to get the total amount earned: $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3 * 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we need to find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2 * 16 = 32 minutes
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3 to find the time it takes to swim 3 miles:
3 * 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time between a hot day and a cold day, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size: 12 * 1/4 = 12 * 0.25 = 3 cubic inches

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in the angle of the sun relative to the ground. 

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. 

Since the sun moves for 10 hours, the change in the angle of the sun is 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

The new angle of the sun will be the initial angle (32 degrees) plus the change in the angle (50 degrees), which is 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

The final angle of the sun relative to the ground is 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since the older son is 12 years old and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many candles James needs in total. Since the older son is 12 and the younger son is 8, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, the total amount James spends on candles is 4 * 3 = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week.

70 + 100 = 170

1/4 of 12 is 3 sandwiches.

In total, Cody and Trevor ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches.
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we need to follow the given information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
3. Richie scored 80 goals.

Let's start by finding the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can set up an equation:
Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = Mark's goals + 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We can set up another equation:
Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = Anna's goals + 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 per day for 3 days. 
Total amount spent on wooden action figures = $5 * 3 = $15

He has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. 
Total amount spent on plastic action figures = $55 / $2 = 27.5

Since we can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 27 plastic action figures.

Total wooden action figures = 3
Total plastic action figures = 27

Total action figures = 3 + 27 = 30

The final answer is 30."

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each shop orders per week by 4.

First flower shop: 20 roses/week * 4 weeks = 80 roses
Second flower shop: 15 roses/week * 4 weeks = 60 roses
Third flower shop: 30 roses/week * 4 weeks = 120 roses

Total roses supplied: 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses

Ford grows 40 roses per week. In a month, he grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total roses he grows from the total roses supplied to the shops: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in that time period.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, we can multiply the monthly amount by the number of months in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 24 months in 2 years.

Total amount removed = $100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount removed
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 1
Cost of bread = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves
Cost of bread = $3.00 * 1
Cost of bread = $3.00

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00

"To find the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find the temperature that is 4% more than 520. 
To do this, we multiply 520 by 1.04 (which is 100% + 4%): 
520 * 1.04 = 540

"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is 0.1 x $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = Total cost / Total pairs
= $180.00 / 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
Since he earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Now, we multiply the number of times she needs to drink water by the amount of water she needs per time.

8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM. He increases it by 5 words to get 52 WPM. To find the next increase, we subtract the initial speed from the second speed: 52 - 47 = 5. 

Now, we add this increase to the second speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. 

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is 52."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. 
In 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: 2.5"
"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, the number of friends' spouses, and the number of people she directly invited.

1. Alex invited 100 people.
2. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of additional guests is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of additional guests is 10 + 8 = 18.
4. Now, we add up all the people: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends' friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Alex will need 318 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall. It's still less than Mark's window height.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall. It's still less than Mark's window height.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall. Now it exceeds Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate the amount of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the amount of mushrooms he eats per day by the amount of protein per cup:

200 grams (mushrooms) * 3 grams (protein per cup) = 600 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 to get the weekly amount:

600 grams (protein per day) * 7 days = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get: 10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

He has 8 quarters, which is 8 * $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 / $0.05 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

Weight used now = 12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Now, let's add the total number of games Steve has after 3 years: 
17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games

"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

"To find out how many times the tires will rotate in a year, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by 12.

400 miles/month * 12 months/year = 4800 miles/year

Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven per year by 2 to find the total rotations per year.

4800 miles/year / 2 miles/rotation = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year to find out how many years it will last.

10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations/year = 4362.5 years

The tire will last approximately 4362.5 years before it needs to be replaced."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump = Cost per washing * 60
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax first. 
Sales tax rate is not given, but we can assume it's 8% for this example. 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have negative money, he will be short $6.70.

Final answer: -$6.70"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. 

Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7 days:

4 dozen * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to the total number of croissants:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we multiply the total number of croissants by 1/4 pound:

336 croissants * 1/4 pound = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for the remaining 5 months:
$150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,237,625

The total cost of John's research is the sum of the funding for the first 5 months and the remaining 5 months:

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row: 
4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so we calculate the number of seats occupied by administrators:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so we calculate the number of seats occupied by parents:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by students:
54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school. Since he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours, and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. Next, we add the gum he chews on the way home from school and after dinner. This is 1 piece + 1 piece = 2 pieces.

3. Now, we add the gum he chews at school and the way home from school and after dinner. 4 + 2 = 6 pieces.

4. Since Jim has a 20 pack of gum, we subtract the 6 pieces he chewed from the total. 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

5. Finally, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Jim gives to his sister. Since he gives half of the remaining gum, we divide 14 by 2. 14 / 2 = 7.

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

Current height: 40 inches
Required height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Now, let's calculate the difference:
48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we'll divide the difference by his growth rate:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so they paid 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James also got a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made a total of $175,000 (profit) + $17,500 (commission) = $192,500.

"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can calculate the number of women who can stay upright as follows:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15 women

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Since the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of truck stamps and rose stamps Max bought.

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are looking for the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we need a positive relative speed. We can achieve this by taking the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph |
Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Naomi's catch - 6 = Darren's catch
17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Darren's catch + 3 = Tommy's catch
11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum amount they are willing to pay ($10 per class).

Total cost of classes = Number of classes * Cost per class
Total cost of classes = 10 * $60
Total cost of classes = $600

Since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the total cost exceeds $600.

Let's assume Manny misses 'x' classes. The total cost will be:
Total cost = (10 - x) * $60 (since he can't miss more than 10 classes)

We want to find the maximum value of 'x' such that the total cost is less than or equal to $600.

(10 - x) * $60 ≤ $600
(10 - x) ≤ $600 / $60
(10 - x) ≤ 10
10 - x ≤ 10
-x ≤ 0
x ≥ 0

Since 'x' represents the number of classes Manny can miss, it must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 0.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is the sum of their individual productions: 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance. 

Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 17 miles

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50

Now, let's add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together:
$26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the hole. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time it will take to dig the hole.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus amount.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 12 = $1666.67 (approximately)

Now, we add the raise and the bonus to his current salary:
$20000 + $1000 + $1666.67 = $21666.67

To calculate his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12:
$21666.67 * 12 = $26000

The final answer is: $26000"

"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil: 
Distance of soil = 24 feet
Rate of digging through soil = 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = Distance / Rate = 24 / 4 = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay:
Distance of clay = 8 feet
Rate of digging through clay = 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour (since he digs half as fast through clay)
Time to dig through clay = Distance / Rate = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we need to find the total cost before the discount:
20 * $30 = $600

Then, we apply the 10% discount:
$600 * 0.10 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and we got a negative number, it means that Clara paid less than Sheila. The correct answer is $142.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to first find the amount she made from green hats. 

Let's denote the amount she made from green hats as G. Since her sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

400 = 1/2 * G
G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, she made $800 from green hats in the first month.

Now, to find the total amount she made in the first month, we add the sales from both red and green hats:
Total amount in the first month = 400 + 800 = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 
Total sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
Total sales in the second month = 900

Now, to find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from both months:
Total amount in two months = 1200 + 900
Total amount in two months = 2100

The final answer is: 2100"

The total cost of the plane for the first year is $1,860,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cooking time for the pork and then the beans. 

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times of all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 4s + 2g = 70.

Since each animal has one head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations simultaneously. 

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40.

Now, subtract the first equation from this new equation: (2s + 2g) - (4s + 2g) = 40 - 70
This simplifies to -2s = -30.

Dividing both sides by -2 gives s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days in the month. 

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and 10 neutral days in the first 30 days. 

We know that her first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. 

So, the total number of days in the month is 30. 

Now, we need to find the number of good days left in the month. 

We know that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. 

So, the total number of good days in the month is 12 (initial good days) + 3 (good days in the next three days) = 15.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide 600 by 30.

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

Therefore, it will take 20 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he had 1 toy per dog. 

When he left, there were 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs became 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needed 12 toys initially. However, he only had 4 toys, so he had to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

When he came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so the total number of dogs became 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.

However, 3 dogs were gone, so the total number of dogs became 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5.

Dylan's investment = 1200 * (2/5) = 480

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount.

Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply the remaining amount by 2/3.

Frances' investment = 720 * (2/3) = 480

4. Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment.

Skyler's investment = 720 - 480 = 240

So, Skyler's investment was $240.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they have already collected. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures in total, we need to subtract the signatures they already have from their goal. 
100 - 64 = 36 signatures

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings would be $20 * 3 = $60.

To find out her earnings for two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

The final answer is 120."
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes required to make 36 hash browns.

Number of hash browns per 6 potatoes = 36
Number of potatoes = 96

To find the number of hash browns per potato, we divide 36 by 6:
36 ÷ 6 = 6

Now, we multiply the number of hash browns per potato by the total number of potatoes:
6 hash browns/potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load of the elevator
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally add up the number of cookies each person has.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total: 
68 + 5 = 73 cookies for Max.

Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's total: 
73 - 12 = 61 cookies for the Cookie Monster.

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to the Cookie Monster's total: 
61 + 23 = 84 cookies for Summer.

Now that we know the number of cookies each person has, we can add them up to find the total number of cookies:
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 84 (Summer) = 286 cookies.

The total number of cookies is 286."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress, so the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We know the final length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent walking from the total time available.

Total time available = 30 minutes
Time spent walking to the corner = 6 minutes

"To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we need to multiply the number of cookies Greta bakes by 2. 

Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since there is one set of twins, the age of the older twin would be 'x + 7'. 

There is also a set of triplets, so we'll denote the age of the youngest triplet as 'y'. The ages of the other two triplets would be 'y + 1' and 'y + 2'. 

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + y + (y + 1) + (y + 2) = 44

Combine like terms:

2x + 3y + 10 = 44

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x + 3y = 34

Now, we need to find integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. We can try different values of y and see if we can find a corresponding integer value of x.

Let's try y = 4:

2x + 3(4) = 2x + 12 = 34

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 22

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 11

So, the age of the younger twin is 11 years.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert 3 hours into minutes. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John has for his homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time:
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10: 
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (since 10 is 2.5 times 4): 
$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies: 
$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year and then multiply by the number of years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. In 10 years, Rong will have saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per year. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month. 2/5 of 20 is 8, so Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year. In 10 years, Neil will have saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

To find the total number of coins they have together, we add the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved. 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2. 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's represent the total bill as 'x'. 
60% of x = 0.6x
Since the total bill includes the cost of vaccines ($40) and the heartworm check, we can set up the equation:
0.6x = $40 + x

To solve for x, we subtract x from both sides:
0.6x - x = $40
-0.4x = $40
Divide both sides by -0.4:
x = $100

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find out how much John leaves with:
$125 (initial amount) - $100 (total bill) = $25

John leaves with $25."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

"To find the total amount of money spent, we need to calculate the total number of people, drinks, and snacks.

Aiden and his 12 friends are initially 13 people. Then, they meet up with 7 more friends, making the total number of people 13 + 7 = 20.

Each seat can hold 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks. Since there are 20 people, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks as follows:

- Total number of drinks: 20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
- Total number of snacks: 20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks and snacks is:
- Total cost of drinks: 40 drinks * $2/drinks = $80
- Total cost of snacks: 60 snacks * $2/snacks = $120

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is the sum of the cost of drinks and snacks:

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The total capacity of the three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds.
4. To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks. 
   So, 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is also 50.

Since Gerald spent $10, we can set up an equation to find out how much money he had initially. Let's assume Gerald's share is 3x. 

3x = 3/5 of the total amount
3x = (3/5) * 100
3x = 60
x = 20

So Gerald had $60 initially.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 40%. To find the correct percentage, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If 80% of the 40% used by the city is for industrial purposes, then the remaining percentage is for non-industrial purposes.

40% * 0.8 = 32%

So, 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes. To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract this from 40%.

40% - 32% = 8%

Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its production rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream production in 48 hours: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream production in 48 hours: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total production in 48 hours: 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

"To find out how many scoops Erin should buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

However, the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. So, for every 3 scoops, Erin will only pay for 2 scoops. 

To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy, we can divide 4 scoops by 3.

4 scoops ÷ 3 scoops = 1 set with 1 scoop left over

Since Erin can only buy 1 set of 3 scoops, she can buy 2 scoops (1 set of 3 scoops) and get 1 scoop free.

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy they eat in that time period.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = original price + increase
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = new price of each computer * number of computers
= $770 * 500
= $385,000

The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage it could cause to his car.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole himself includes the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 per bucket) and the fine he would have to pay to the city council (which is $0 since he's fixing it himself). 

The cost of the asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75. 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $75 = $375.

Therefore, Ron saves $375 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * 2/3 = 4/3 of the total pizza. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 4/3 by 12: (4/3) * 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. To find out how many slices they ate, we multiply 1 ½ by 12: 1.5 * 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we need to subtract the slices eaten by all 5 friends from the total number of slices. The total slices eaten is 16 + 18 = 34 slices. Subtracting this from the total number of slices, we get 60 - 34 = 26 slices.

There are 26 slices of pizza left."
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 20 minutes, we can say the dog eats 9 sausages in 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time it takes both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 
The average time is the sum of the individual times divided by 2. 
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Now we solve for 'x': 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Now, add the number of smores the kids and adults will eat: 
18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed: 
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, the number of boxes needed is equal to the number of sleeves needed:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
Since a small sticker is worth 1 small button, she gets 27 small buttons from the trade.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 large buttons from the trade.

Now, she has 27 small buttons from the first trade and 20 large buttons from the second trade. 

However, she also trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
Since a large button is worth 3 small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from the trade.

Now, she has 27 small buttons from the first trade, 20 large buttons from the second trade, and 60 small buttons from the third trade. 
So, she has a total of 27 + 60 = 87 small buttons and 20 large buttons.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. So, 60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's start by finding the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies. We know that two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. Let's set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has ($70) to the money Ava gave him ($45):

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the total 250 cases, we can calculate it as follows:
1/2 * 250 = 125 cases

The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so we multiply the amount the first house needs by 2:
125 * 2 = 250 cases

Therefore, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, we add 90 to the number of bananas: 
200 + 90 = 290

So, George has 290 fruits in total.

290"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the ball. 

She started with $80 and spent $20 on the ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left.

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many she bought: $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

"To find the total cost of making 4 liters of juice, we need to first find out how many kilograms of oranges are needed for 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost of 20 kilograms of oranges will be 20 * $3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find the total number of books read, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find the number of books Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books initially and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we can divide 450 by 2 to find the number of books Ahmed read: 450 / 2 = 225.

To find the total number of books read, we add the number of books Ezra and Ahmed read: 450 (Ezra) + 225 (Ahmed) = 675.

The final answer is: 675"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours * $15 per hour = 4 * 5 * 15 = $60

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = 2 * 2 * 15 = $60

However, Tanya also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the additional $5. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the additional $5.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days:
$60 (Monday) + $60 (Wednesday) = $120

Tanya's total earnings for these two days of teaching is $120.

"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 (vanilla scents) - 16 (fruity scents) = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he made from eggplants is:
20 * 3 = $60

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to subtract the amount he made from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make:
$135 - $60 = $75

Now, we know that Bennet has 25 ears of corn and he needs to make $75 from selling them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25):
$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent on other activities = Time spent reading + Time spent playing video games = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

Time spent on soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent on other activities = 12 hours - 6 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes him to drive to the museum and back.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, the total time he is gone from home is the sum of the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 8 hours

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost per movie
= 200 * 6
= $1200

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:
Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Step 4: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the remaining movies.
Since the remaining movies are not in series or older movies, they are normal movies. The cost of normal movies is $10 each, so we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost per movie
= 400 * 10
= $4000

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $4000
= $5000

The final answer is: $5000"

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their driving speed as follows:
Driving speed = 50 mph
Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 mph
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 mph

Now, we know the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours) and their hiking speed (20 mph). We can use the formula: distance = speed * time to find the distance.

Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score: 0 (enemies) + 8 (berries) + 26 (time) = 34 points.

Ava's score: 
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 + 0 = 8 enemies.
- She collects 8 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 3 = 5 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score: 8 (enemies) + 5 (berries) + 30 (time) = 43 points.

The difference between their scores is 43 - 34 = 9 points.

On the usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. So, for these two days, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish (this is not possible, so we will ignore this result). However, we can assume that the 17 fish taken out were not all orange. Let's say x of the 17 fish taken out were orange, and the rest were white. 

We know that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's represent the number of white fish Bob bought as y. 

Initially, Bob had 4 white fish. After adding y white fish, he had 4 + y white fish. 

Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, the number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 2(4 + y). 

We know that the total number of fish after adding the new fish is 7 + x + y. Since the 17 fish taken out were removed from the total, we can set up the equation:

7 + x + y = 3 + 4 + 17

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7 + x + y = 24

Now, we know that the number of orange fish after adding the new fish is 2(4 + y). We also know that the number of orange fish initially was 3. So, the number of orange fish added is 2y. 

We can set up another equation:

3 + x = 2(4 + y)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + x = 8 + 2y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

7 + x + y = 24
3 + x = 8 + 2y

We can solve for x in the second equation:

x = 5 - 2y

Now, substitute x into the first equation:

7 + (5 - 2y) + y = 24

Combine like terms:

12 - y = 24

Subtract 12 from both sides:

-y = 12

Multiply both sides by -1:

y = -12

However, the number of fish cannot be negative. This means that our initial assumption that the 17 fish taken out were not all orange is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

We know that the number of orange fish after adding the new fish is twice the number of white fish. We can set up an equation:

2(4 + y) = 3 + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + 2y = 3 + x

Now, we can substitute x from the equation 7 + x + y = 24:

8 + 2y = 3 + (24 - y)

Combine like terms:

8 + 2y = 27 - y

Add y to both sides:

8 + 3y = 27

Subtract 8 from both sides:

3y = 19

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 19/3

Since y represents the number of white fish, it must be a whole number. However, 19/3 is not a whole number. This means that our initial assumption that the number of white fish Bob bought is y is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

2(4 + y) = 3 + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + 2y = 3 + x

Now, we can substitute x from the equation 7 + x + y = 24:

8 + 2y = 3 + (24 - y)

Combine like terms:

8 + 2y = 27 - y

Add y to both sides:

8 + 3y = 27

Subtract 8 from both sides:

3y = 19

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 19/3

Since y represents the number of white fish, it must be a whole number. However, 19/3 is not a whole number. This means that our initial assumption that the number of white fish Bob bought is y is incorrect.

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy uses his car from Monday to Friday, he travels 5 miles per day for 5 days, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 miles per week.

Now, we can divide the total distance by his fuel efficiency to find out how much gas he consumes per week: 
25 miles / 10 MPG = 2.5 gallons per week.

Since the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, we can multiply the amount of gas consumed per week by the price per gallon to find the total cost:
2.5 gallons * $3/gallon = $7.50 per week.

The final answer is: $7.50"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 
3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties.

Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * $20 = $120 from the twenties.

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * $0.25 = $35 from the quarters.

The total amount she spent is $120 (from twenties) + $35 (from quarters) = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

Tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine the total amount he needs to cover the trip. Since the school is covering half the cost, John needs to cover the other half.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half, John needs to cover $300 / 2 = $150.

John already has $50, so to find out how much he is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs:

$150 (amount needed) - $50 (amount John has) = $100

John is missing $100."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and the temperature at night is 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To find the number of logs needed, we divide the temperature difference (32 - 12 = 20 degrees) by the heating capacity of each log (5 degrees). 

20 / 5 = 4

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

"To find out how much Jamie was paid, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours she worked.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours (11 hours - 8 hours), her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. 
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Now, we add her earnings for the regular hours and the additional hours:
$160 + $90 = $250

Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day."
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions first. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can divide the number of female lions by 2.

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since they are 25% off, we need to calculate 25% of $40.

25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30.

Now, let's subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans.

Final answer: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. 

After 1 month: 200 + 20 = 220 employees
After 2 months: 220 + 20 = 240 employees
After 3 months: 240 + 20 = 260 employees

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total amount paid in the first month: 200 employees * $4000 = $800,000
Total amount paid in the second month: 220 employees * $4000 = $880,000
Total amount paid in the third month: 240 employees * $4000 = $960,000

Total amount paid in three months: $800,000 + $880,000 + $960,000 = $2,640,000

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after the two raises. 

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After the first raise of $0.50, his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After the second raise of $1.00, his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, we need to calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work. 
Billy's total earnings = hourly wage * number of hours worked
= $11.50 * 20
= $230

Since Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, her starting salary is $10.50. 
Sally's hourly wage is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. 
Sally's total earnings = hourly wage * number of hours worked
= $11.00 * 20
= $220

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings.
$230 - $220 = $10

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately.

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers: 1000 + 240 = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to eliminate the fraction:

1 = 0.3(14 + x)

Now, distribute 0.3 to 14 + x:

1 = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtract 4.2 from both sides:

-3.2 = 0.3x

Divide both sides by 0.3:

-10.67 = x

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 10 stuffed goats to get 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris played for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. 
14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she played for 7 days. 
7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours

"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we can divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make: 
72 / 12 = 6 square inches per bag.

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2: 
6 * 2 = 12 square inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can divide the total square inches by 3 to find the length:

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower:

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 1 * 5 = 5 petals
- 1 * 6 = 6 petals
- 1 * 4 = 4 petals
- 1 * 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:

"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows left = 35 - 18 - 3 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores that can be made with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores that can be made by 2 (since there are 2 kids).

Number of S'mores per kid = 14 / 2 = 7

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's denote the time Jack's better friend played as x. Since Jack's friends are significantly worse, they can play for half as long, so they played for x/2. Jack played for 20 minutes.

We know that the total time they played is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. We can set up the equation:

20 + (x/2) + x = 240

Combine like terms:

20 + 3x/2 = 240

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

40 + 3x = 480

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3x = 440

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 146.67 minutes

Now that we know the time Jack's better friend played, we can calculate the total time each person played:

Jack: 20 minutes
Friend 1: 20/2 = 10 minutes
Friend 2: 20/2 = 10 minutes
Better friend: 146.67 minutes

Now, let's calculate the cost:

Jack: 20 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 1 game
Friend 1: 10 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 0.5 games
Friend 2: 10 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 0.5 games
Better friend: 146.67 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 7.33 games

Total cost:
Jack: 1 game * $0.25 = $0.25
Friend 1: 0.5 games * $0.25 = $0.125
Friend 2: 0.5 games * $0.25 = $0.125
Better friend: 7.33 games * $0.25 = $1.825

Total cost: $0.25 + $0.125 + $0.125 + $1.825 = $2.275

The total cost is approximately $2.28."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

To convert the fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:
O = 10/3 ≈ 3.33

The final answer is 3.33."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling 8 cars. Then, he gives away 16 cars to his mother, leaving him with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (amount from organizations) = $125,000 (amount from students)

Since there are 20 students, we can divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 students = $6,250 per student

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. So, she walked for 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day. Converting this to minutes:
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to find the total time:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars at that time: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the pay per task.

Since John does 30 cycles a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since he works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks he completes in a week is:
150 tasks/day * 7 days/week = 1050 tasks/week

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a week is:
1050 tasks/week * $1.20/task = $1260/week

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many tins of cat food and dog food Kimberly bought, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package.

Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

To find the difference, we subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins:
88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

Final answer: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Let's start with the green eggs. Cindy had 5 green eggs.

Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Since she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping and then subtract the refund amount from the original purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
Weight: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
Original purchase price: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
Total cost (shipping + original purchase price): $3.00 + $32 = $35
Refund amount: $24
Amount Milly will lose: $35 - $24 = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Mulan initially had $40.
Her father gave her $100, so now she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.
She also buys a bag for $20.

The total amount she spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total amount she spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

Week 1: 8,000 bars
Week 2: Half of Week 1 = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Week 3: Three times as much as Week 1 = 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Since the production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars, we can subtract this from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

Time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week
Converting 90 minutes to hours: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours
Total time spent on makeup in a month: 1.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 6 hours
Total time spent on TikTok in a month: 8 hours (writing songs) + 6 hours (doing makeup) = 14 hours

The final answer is: 14"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are: 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, so the cost of the additional mirrors will be 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors. The cost of the additional mirrors will be 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

Angela has 2 chandeliers, so the cost of the additional chandeliers will be 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier. The cost of the additional chandelier will be 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

Angela has 20 pictures, so the cost of the additional pictures will be 20 - 10 = 10 pictures. The cost of the additional pictures will be 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the standard items is $129.00. The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches high.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of one turtle is:

Speed of one turtle = Speed of one kangaroo / 2
Speed of one turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of one turtle = 3 hours

Since there are four turtles, the total time it will take for them to travel across the highway is:

Total time = Total distance / Speed of one turtle
We don't know the total distance, but we can use the fact that 3 kangaroos can travel it in 18 hours. Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can use the speed of the kangaroo to find the distance:

Distance = Speed of one kangaroo * Time
Distance = 6 hours * 18 hours
Distance = 108 hours

Now we can find the total time it will take for the four turtles to travel across the highway:

Total time = Total distance / Speed of one turtle
Total time = 108 hours / 3 turtles
Total time = 36 hours

However, since there are 4 turtles, we need to multiply the time by 4:

Total time = 36 hours * 4
Total time = 144 hours

"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to first find out how many dishes each of them made.

Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes made by each of them: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. 

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as 'x'. We know that the total amount she needs to buy the laptop is $50, so we can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:
x + 230 = 450

Now, subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."

From the large apples, Adam gets 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
From the small apples, Adam gets 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the current 3 cows produce.

Current milk production: 3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the length of each glue stick that is not used.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length: (5/6) * 12 = 10 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 - 10 = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length: (1/3) * 12 = 4 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 - 4 = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length: (1/2) * 12 = 6 mm. The length of the unused part is 12 - 6 = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused parts: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Jack has 30 socks.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60

So, Peter has 60 socks.

Now, we know that Peter has 60 socks and Jack has 30 socks. To find the total number of socks, we add 60 + 30.

60 + 30 = 90

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

To find the total number of dishes, we add 60 + 30.

60 + 30 = 90

Now, we have the total number of socks (90) and dishes (90). To find the total number of items, we add 90 + 90.

90 + 90 = 180

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so let's represent my brother's age as B. Then, my age would be B - 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age would be (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age would be 3B - 1.
4. The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: (B - 3) + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87.

Now, let's solve the equation:
B - 3 + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87
Combine like terms:
5B - 9 = 87
Add 9 to both sides:
5B = 96
Divide by 5:
B = 19.2

Since B must be a whole number (age can't be a fraction), we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as we can't have a fraction of a year. So, B = 19.

Now that we know B, we can find my age:
My age = B - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16.

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.
Total oranges given away = 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 * 0.5 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold.

Paige baked 2 loaves per hour, and she baked for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM). So, she baked a total of 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices sold by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins: 
Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is:

50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Since Mr. George ate 20 burritos, we need to subtract those from the total number of burritos given to the students:

500 burritos - 20 burritos = 480 burritos

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480.

The final answer is: 480"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know that the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
= 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
= 75 - 52
= 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let's say Fawn has x books, Anne has y books, and Sofie has z books.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: z = y + 25.

We also know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: y = x - 12.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation: z = (x - 12) + 25.

Simplifying the equation, we get: z = x + 13.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can write another equation: x + y + z = 85.

Substituting the expressions for y and z, we get: x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85.

Combine like terms: 3x + 1 = 85.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3x = 84.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 28.

So, Fawn has 28 books.

28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will have. 

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the jello. We know the price per box is $1.25.

Number of boxes needed: 12
Price per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

The seller pays with $4000, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 
$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the total amount Keenan spends in a month by 4.

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is 40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

The final answer is 48."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the soda and the cost of the water separately.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $21.00 = $63.00.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find Ella's hourly rate, we need to divide the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3). 

$33 ÷ 3 = $11 per hour

$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

The final answer is 132."
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he lost 20 marbles.
4. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300 chickens.

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he will make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much Isaias paid for each chicken. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to sell the chickens for by the number of chickens he plans to sell:

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought each chicken for approximately $61.11."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the total cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long. So, the total cost of the new rope is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the original rope, which is 20 meters long, and it costs $2 per meter. So, the total amount she has is:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount she has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Since Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation: 8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides: x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * (1/2 * $4) = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in her cart: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91.

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, it means Kelly has overspent her budget. She doesn't have any money left in her budget.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x meters per second.

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To find the speed of the thingamabob (x), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Whirligig speed = 5x
Whirligig speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig speed = 55 meters per second

"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first determine the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, which is $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2 (since she eats 2 carrots per day). 

$2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage. 

New hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $12 * 40
Weekly earnings = $480

The final answer is 480."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation 6x = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + (3 * 6) + (5 * 6) = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54.

Since Tasha made $80 in total, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks.
Martha had 3x notebooks.
Since Martha had 7 notebooks, we can set up the equation: 3x = 7
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

Since Joseph had 2.33 notebooks initially, Martha had 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 2.33 = 7.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 2.33 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's notebooks:
7 - 2.33 = 4.67

So, Martha now has 4.67 more notebooks than Joseph.

The final answer is: 4.67"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first calculate Anis's distance. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1 + 1/5. 

1 + 1/5 = 6/5

Now, multiply Dijana's distance by 6/5:
(6/5) * 50 = 60 miles

So, Anis rowed 60 miles.

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
50 (Dijana) + 60 (Anis) = 110 miles

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis on that day is 110 miles."

"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, his total is still 13 pages.

Now, let's compare their total pages:
Denise's total: 10 + 18 = 28 pages
Daniel's total: 13 pages

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: 28 - 13 = 15

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we first need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. 

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating, that makes a total of 4 people. 

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, Calvin can have 2 bowls for himself and his wife, and 2 bowls for the children. This leaves 4 bowls of soup for the children.

Now, we need to divide the remaining 4 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 

4 bowls / 2 children = 2

So, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times."

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for each type of mask and then add them together.

For small masks: 
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards = 10 yards

For large masks:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 3.33 sets of 2.25 yards
Since you can't buy a fraction of a yard, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, 3.33 sets of 2.25 yards = 4 sets of 2.25 yards
4 sets of 2.25 yards = 9 yards

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 9 yards (for large masks) = 19 yards

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He also walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To find the number of red shoe boxes left, we first need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes. 

1/3 of 9 red shoe boxes is 9 / 3 = 3.

Since Tim used 3 red shoe boxes, he has 9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes left.

For the blue shoe boxes, Tim used 3 out of 7. 

7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

So, the total number of shoe boxes left is 6 red + 4 blue = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the number of books Joseph had initially, we need to multiply Sarah's number of books by 2. 

9 * 2 = 18

Since Joseph lost 2 books, we subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away.

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows:

1/5 * 30 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

Now, we need to add the 10 marbles he gave to Donald:

6 (given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Dean has 14 marbles left.

14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, D = 60.

Substituting D = 60 into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, let's solve for A:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the number of acres in Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day would be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time he spends on both the normal and extreme sudoku puzzles.

Time for normal sudoku: 45 minutes
Time for extreme sudoku: 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Total time: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to divide the total time by 30 minutes to find out how many bottles he drinks.

Total bottles = Total time / 30 minutes
Total bottles = 225 minutes / 30 minutes
Total bottles = 7.5

Since you can't drink half a bottle, we can round down to 7 bottles.

The final answer is 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2 * 20 (bologna thrown at red balloons) + 3 * x (bologna thrown at yellow balloons) = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3x = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 6

So, Benny threw 6 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. Since there are 20 red balloons, the number of yellow balloons is:

20 (red balloons) + 6 (yellow balloons) = 26

Therefore, there are 26 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total number of miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them together.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. Since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, the total cost of the balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.

The total cost of the items they bought is the cost of the cake ($11) + the cost of the balloons ($3) + the cost of the ice cream (2 * $7 = $14). So, the total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they spent $28 in total, and they have 2 girls, we divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each girl received. $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

Number of students playing tennis: 6
Number of students playing volleyball: 2 * 6 = 12

Total number of students: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

Total number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops
Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240
Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

1. Cats: 3
2. Dogs: 3 times the number of cats, so 3 * 3 = 9 dogs
3. Rabbits: 2 fewer than dogs, so 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits
4. Fish: 3 times the number of rabbits, so 3 * 7 = 21 fish
5. Gerbils: 1/3 the number of fish, so 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person eats per day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the number of months she has been collecting shells: 60 months.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of mint tea. Since Lana brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, and she has 27 cups in total, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

4"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find the number of round trips he can make in 8 hours.

8 hours / 4 hours per round trip = 2 round trips

Since each round trip consists of going down and coming back up, the sloth can make 2 round trips in 8 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick in 2 round trips. We know that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since each round trip consists of going down and coming back up, the sloth will make 2 round trips in 8 hours. 

So, the total number of berries he can pick in 2 round trips is 24 berries.

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick per round trip. 

24 berries / 2 round trips = 12 berries per round trip

Since each round trip consists of going down and coming back up, the sloth can pick 12 berries per round trip.

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick per trip down to the ground. 

Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, he can pick 12 berries per round trip. 

A round trip consists of going down and coming back up, so the number of berries he picks per trip down to the ground is half of the number of berries he picks per round trip.

12 berries per round trip / 2 = 6 berries per trip down to the ground.

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the tank, we first need to calculate half the amount of water in the pool. 

Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since they are filling the tank with water from the pool, the tank initially has 5000 gallons of water.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. 

To find the amount of water remaining after 6 days, we need to subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank.

5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets Colby can buy with $134. 

$134 / $10 = 13.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 13 tickets. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of movies he can see. He has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and 8 movies on other days. 

13 tickets + 5 movies + 8 movies = 26 movies

The final answer is 26."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are 2 days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Total days = 5

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Total days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is:
4 friends * 2 balloons per friend = 8 balloons
Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes:
8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial balloons and the additional balloons:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

The total number of balloons the girls have is 24."
"To find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total, we need to add the number of boxes donated by the 10 people and the number of boxes they already own.

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables they need.

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

However, they already have 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed.

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find out how much money Fern will make from each machine, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced and then multiply it by the price of each widget.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets
Total money from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Sheep's hay = 2 * goat's hay - 3
Sheep's hay = 2 * 5 - 3
Sheep's hay = 10 - 3
Sheep's hay = 7

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:

Total hay for goats = 15 * 5
Total hay for goats = 75

Total hay for sheep = 12 * 7
Total hay for sheep = 84

Now, we can find the total amount of hay needed by adding the hay for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = Total hay for goats + Total hay for sheep
Total hay needed = 75 + 84
Total hay needed = 159

"To find out how much John has left after buying the pencils, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract the cost of the pencils and gas.

John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has:
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars

He also buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the total cost of the pencils is:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, we subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:
250 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 

The total cost of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
40% of $150 is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. The total amount he got from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110.

For yams: 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9
For sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20
For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of root crop: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance, which is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken by James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Let's denote Dinar's score as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's score is x + 10. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's score is (x + 10) - 20. 

We also know that the total score is 45 points. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 - 20) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x - 0 = 45.

Add 0 to both sides: 3x = 45.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15.

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's score: Azibo's score = (15 + 10) - 20 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2. 

Now, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book: 
2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes Vince worked. 

He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she slept. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 8 hours by 60 minutes to get 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the total minutes she slept.

Now, let's calculate the total minutes she slept on her bed that day. 

Total minutes she slept = 480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes.

The final answer is: 475"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to a numerical value. Two dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups. Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds

So, the initial number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
100 + (50 * 14) = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 800 = 200

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 200."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information step by step.

1. Total emails sent per day: 16
2. Work emails: 7
3. Remainder of emails: 16 - 7 = 9
4. Emails to family: 2/3 of the remainder: 2/3 * 9 = 6
5. Emails to boyfriend: 1/3 of the remainder: 1/3 * 9 = 3

Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find Aliya's age and then multiply it by 3. 

Aliya is 3 years old. 
Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we multiply Shawna's age by 5. 
Shawna's father is 9 * 5 = 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

First, let's find 20% of 48:
20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from Courtney's number:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of balls each boy picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason did. 
So, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine that Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 2 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jason) + 2 (Jordan) = 8.

Therefore, the coach brought 8 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 31 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up the equation 4 * 31 = total holes on the fourth day. 

4 * 31 = 124

Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is 124 - 31 = 93 holes.

Final answer: 93"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we need to add these amounts together: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225.

"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus 50% of the cost of the supplies, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

And we know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for S into the first equation:
A + (4A - 13) + X = 339

Substituting X = S + 5 into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (S + 5) = 339

Since S = 4A - 13, we can substitute this into the equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339

Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Total minutes per episode = 20 minutes
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we need to multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200 minutes

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the first leg is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the second leg is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance covered in the third leg is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is traveling in a southerly direction for the first leg and then a northerly direction for the second leg, and finally a southerly direction for the third leg, we need to subtract the distance covered in the second leg from the sum of the first and third legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
300 miles + 110 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
To find her age, we calculate 75% of 8: 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given length = 15 feet and width = 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can calculate Richard's share as follows:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting Richard's share from the total number of cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Richard's cherries - Robert's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 20 - 30
Jerry's cherries = 10

"To find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to subtract 4 from the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday. 

Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday = 15
Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday = 15 - 4 = 11

Now, we know the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days. 

Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday = 10
Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day.

Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday = 10 * $6 = $60
Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday = 15 * $6 = $90
Earnings from apple pie on Saturday = 11 * $15 = $165
Earnings from apple pie on Sunday = 15 * $15 = $225

Total earnings for Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

First, convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space each plant occupies: 
12 inches (plant width) + 1.5 feet (space between) * 12 inches/foot = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the bed by the space each plant occupies: 
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't fit a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be:

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we can calculate how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$2,000 (monthly income) - $500 (monthly savings) = $1,500 (monthly expenses)

There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide her monthly expenses by 12 to find out how many months she can afford to buy shoes in a year.

$1,500 / 12 = $125 per month

Now, we can calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year.

$125 (monthly expenses) / $1,000 (cost per pair) = 0.125 pairs per month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12.

0.125 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 1.5 pairs/year

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pair of shoes, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

1.5 pairs/year ≈ 1 pair/year

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the cooling effect of the air conditioner on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The net cooling effect is the difference between the cooling effect on high and low:
12 degrees - 6 degrees = 6 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, we need to subtract the warming effect for the 2 hours the air conditioner was off:
6 degrees - 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 6 degrees - 4 degrees = 2 degrees

So, the final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can calculate the total number of flights made by the first plane as 44 * 2 = 88.

The first plane makes three-quarters of its flights to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is 88 * (3/4) = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is (88 - 66) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11.

The final answer is 11."
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 * $6 = $12. So, the total amount of money he received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings. 

$30 (total cost) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4 years respectively. 

2. Let's denote the age of Helene as H and the age of Wilfred as W. We know that Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4.

3. Since Helene is twice the average age of the group, we can write the equation: H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4).

4. We also know that the total age of the children is 20. So, we can write another equation: 3 + 4 + H + W = 20.

5. Now we have two equations:
   a) H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4)
   b) 3 + 4 + H + W = 20

6. We can simplify equation a) to H = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 2, since H = 2 * ((3 + 4 + H + W) / 4) can be simplified to H = (3 + 4 + H + W) / 2.

7. Now we can substitute the value of H from equation b) into equation a): 
   (3 + 4 + H + W) / 2 = H
   7 + H + W = 2H
   7 + W = H

8. Now we can substitute the value of H from equation b) into the equation 7 + W = H:
   7 + W = 7
   W = 0

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on the total amount collected, not just Walter's contributions.

However, the problem states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount collected so far.

Since Walter's friend is going to give him $200, we can assume that Walter's friend's contribution is not included in the total amount collected so far. 

So, the total amount collected so far is $2000. Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as the total amount collected so far. 

The amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute is 3 * $2000 = $6000."
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of the total number of cookies. 

There were 100 guests, each bringing 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.

Half of the cookies is 1/2 * 1500 = 750 cookies.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

750 / 15 = 50

The answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the number of slices for the kids is 'x'. Then, the number of slices for the adults would be 2x.

Since the total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Now, we need to find the total number of slices. Since the kids have 2 slices, and the adults have 4 slices, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Since the total number of slices is 6, and the adults have 4 slices, we can find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets by dividing the number of slices for the adults by the total number of slices and multiplying by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

So, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the desired serving time (5:00 pm) to find the latest start time.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To find the total number of chocolate bars sold by both Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can divide 64 by 8 to find the number of chocolate bars in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 * 3 = $45.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $45. The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.

480"
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

To find the total number of new porcupines in a year, we multiply the number of new porcupines per month by 12.

Total new porcupines in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the initial population of porcupines to the total number of new porcupines in a year to find the final population.

Final population = 50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

The final population of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10480 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the total amount of water needed.

Total gallons = 10480 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61980 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = 61980 * 0.10
Cost = 6198

The cost to fill the pool is $6198."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles
Shandy's distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

To find the difference, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000 / 2 = 1500.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, which means the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500 / 2 = 750.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 years old from the total number of students under 16 years old: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students over 16 years old by subtracting the number of male students over 16 years old from the total number of students over 16 years old: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, during the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining at the end is 28%, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
100% - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
100% - 45% - 21% = 28%
34% = 28%

However, this equation is not correct. We need to find the initial charge. Let's re-evaluate the equation:
100% - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
100% - 45% - 21% = 34% (not 28%)
Let's re-evaluate the equation again:
100% - (9% * 5) - (7% * x) = 28%
100% - 45% - (7% * x) = 28%
55% - (7% * x) = 28%
(7% * x) = 27%
x = 27% / 7%
x = 3.86%

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 100% - 3.86% = 96.14%.

Final answer: 96.14"
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits.

He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total money spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25, but since he can't spend a negative amount, this means he actually spent more than he had. However, we can still calculate how many plums he can buy with the money he has left.

Since he has $0.25 left, he can buy 1 plum at $0.25.

The final answer is 1."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first calculate the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

The final answer is: $139"
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to first find the number of pictures in each type of album. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to first determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads. 

Since James reads 18 pages, we divide 18 by 3 to get 6 sets of 3 pages. 

6 sets of 3 pages is 6 * 3 = 18 pages.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we multiply 10 minutes by 6 sets to get 10 * 6 = 60 minutes.

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

John has 22 bananas in total."
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2.
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9.

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions.
18 + 9 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. The total revenue from large stuffed animals is $12x, and the total revenue from small stuffed animals is 2 * $4 * 2x = $8x.

The total revenue from both large and small stuffed animals is $120, so we can set up the equation:

$12x + $8x = $120

Combine like terms:

$20x = $120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by 8 to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: In this case, Marcus has to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 100% - 40% = 60% (since there's a 40% chance of an extension).

2. The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect the homework: In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 50% (since there's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher).

3. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 40%.

4. The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect the homework, and Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his assignment: In this case, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 50% * 20% = 10%.

Now, we need to find the total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework. This is the sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where he has to turn in his homework:

Probability = 60% + 50% + 40% + 10% = 160% 

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to subtract the excess from 100% to get the correct answer.

Corrected Probability = 160% - 100% = 60%

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 60%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 4750 remaining seats, and there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

Final answer: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as follows:

Number of medium-sized beans = 2 * Number of large beans
= 2 * 75
= 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

Number of small beans = Number of medium-sized beans / 3
= 150 / 3
= 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily income and then subtract her expenses.

Total daily income: $15 per day
Total daily expenses: $3 per day (parking)

Total daily income after expenses: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours

Total jury pay: $12 per day * 18 hours = $216

Jury pay per hour: $216 / 18 hours = $12 per hour

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of packs, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes Uncle Franky ordered.

Number of apples in one box: 40
Number of boxes: 2

Total number of apples: 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs:

80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school:
Total amount of money lost = Number of years in school * Annual income before college
Total amount of money lost = 4 years * $25,000/year
Total amount of money lost = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating:
Total amount of money earned = Number of years in school * Annual income after college
Total amount of money earned = 4 years * $75,000/year (since his income tripled)
Total amount of money earned = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to repay the loans:
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = Total amount of money lost + Total amount of money earned
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = $100,000 + $300,000
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = $400,000

Since Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year, we can calculate the number of years it would take him to repay the loans:
Number of years to repay loans = Total amount of money needed to repay loans / Annual loan amount
Number of years to repay loans = $400,000 / $50,000/year
Number of years to repay loans = 8 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length * Width
Area = 8 feet * 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

So, Jim needs 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then multiply that by the population of each city.

Number of countries in South America: 26
Number of cities in each country: 5
Population of each city: 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities in each country * Population of each city

Total population = 130,000

The total population of South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 0.25 feet) = 4.25 feet
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches = 4.33 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 52 inches = 4.33 feet)

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
4.33 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.08 feet

To convert the difference to inches, we multiply by 12:
0.08 feet * 12 inches/foot = 0.96 inches

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 0.96 inches."
"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find the amount taken by the second and third person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So, the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, we need to find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to decimal and multiply it by the number of days.

3/8 = 0.375 (as a decimal)
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:

Hours worked by each painter = 7.875 / 4 = 1.96875 hours

The final answer is 1.96875."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,616.42
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,616.42 = $9,865.58

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,865.58."

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the total becomes 120 + 20 = 140.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people board the train. So, the total becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, so the total becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The pair of running shorts costs $5 more than the tank top, so it costs $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The package of athletic socks costs $8, and Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so the final cost is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile:

200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

The increased cost is $72. To find the total cost, we add the increased cost to the normal cost:

$120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the total cost by 12:

$192 * 12 = $2304

James pays $2304 a year for insurance."
"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads per week and then multiply it by 52.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. 
Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he does 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets per week.

Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices they ate by adding up the slices each of them ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the visit: 
   - The doctor charges $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half of an hour, we can calculate the cost as follows:
   - 30 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.5 hours
   - Cost = 0.5 hours * $300/hour = $150

2. The cost of the cast: 
   - The doctor charges $200 for the cast.

3. The cost of the painkillers: 
   - The doctor charges $4/pill for 30 painkillers. Since we don't know the exact number of pills, we can't calculate the exact cost. However, we can express it as $4 * number of pills.

4. The cost of the parking: 
   - The doctor charges $6/hour for 2 hours. 
   - Cost = 2 hours * $6/hour = $12

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Cost of the visit: $150
- Cost of the cast: $200
- Cost of the painkillers: $4 * number of pills (we can't calculate this exactly, but we can express it as $4x, where x is the number of pills)
- Cost of the parking: $12

Total cost = $150 + $200 + $4x + $12
Total cost = $362 + $4x

Since we can't calculate the exact total cost without knowing the number of pills, we can express the total cost as $362 + $4x."

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

"To find out how much butter Dennis needs, we need to calculate the total amount of butter required for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. 

To find out how many sets of 2 pounds of butter he needs, we divide the total amount of butter required (6 pounds) by 2. 6 / 2 = 3 sets.

Since each set costs $4.00, and he gets one half off, the cost of each set will be $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

The total cost will be 3 sets * $2.00 per set = $6.00.

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. 

Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Cost = $125 + (21 * $6) = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first find out how much money they initially had.

Let's denote Maggie's initial amount of money as M and Riza's initial amount of money as R.

Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4 of her money left, which is (3/4)M. 
Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has 2/3 of her money left, which is (2/3)R.

We are given that both Maggie and Riza have $60 left. So, we can set up the following equations:

(3/4)M = 60
(2/3)R = 60

To solve for M and R, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the respective denominators to get:

M = 60 * (4/3) = 80
R = 60 * (3/2) = 90

Now that we know Maggie and Riza initially had $80 and $90 respectively, we can find out how much money they have left:

Maggie's remaining money: 80 - 60 = 20
Riza's remaining money: 90 - 60 = 30

The total amount of money they have left is 20 + 30 = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 + 14 * 7 = 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

The total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed in the two puzzles.

Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

Then, he finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. So, the total number of pieces he placed in that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

A dozen roses costs $15, and she bought 15 roses. Since 15 is more than a dozen, we need to calculate the cost of 12 roses and then add the cost of 3 more roses.

The cost of 12 roses is $15. The cost of 3 more roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny has 5 dollars. To find out how much change she needs, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she has: $5 - $21 = -$16. Since she can't have a negative amount of money, this means she doesn't have enough money to buy the roses. However, we can still calculate the change she would have if she had enough money.

If she had enough money, the change would be $21 - $5 = $16. Since she only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we divide $16 by 4: $16 / 4 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and then add them together.

Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total sales together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

Terry makes $162 in total."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each train spends at the station and the time between each train's arrival.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after the initial time. 

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the initial time. It stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after the initial time.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the initial time. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, it leaves the station at 125 minutes after the initial time.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the initial time. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the total time Paul will wait for his train. Paul will wait until the fourth train arrives, which is 145 minutes after the initial time. However, we need to subtract the time Paul is already waiting for the first train, which is 10 minutes. 

So, the total time Paul will wait is 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has collected so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her sculpture, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has collected so far from the total number of toothpicks required. 

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks at the same rate. 

To do this, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10). 

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks she needs for her sculpture.

80"
"To find the original price of the watch, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we can set up the equation:

Original price * 0.75 = $2000

To find the original price, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

Original price = $2000 / 0.75
Original price = $2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. We can calculate the selling price:

Selling price = Original price * 1.20
Selling price = $2666.67 * 1.20
Selling price = $3200

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, and then divide it by the original price:

Discount = Original price - Selling price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

Since we are looking for the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Discount percentage = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Discount percentage = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Discount percentage = -20%

The negative sign indicates that the friend actually paid more than the original price, not obtained a discount."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many jellyfish a single spring creates in 1 hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and every second a spring creates a new jellyfish, we can calculate the number of jellyfish created in 1 hour as follows:

60 minutes/hour * 1 jellyfish/second = 60 jellyfish/hour

Since there are 4 hours, we multiply the number of jellyfish created in 1 hour by 4:

60 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 240 jellyfish

Now, since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, we multiply the total number of jellyfish created by 5:

240 jellyfish * 5 = 1200 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 1200 jellyfish in 4 hours.

1200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to walk to the store.

Now, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance (4 miles) at the same speed (4 miles per hour), we can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Since James walked to the store and back, the total time it took him to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

Now, let's find out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually. The amount saved would be the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry will get x + 60 feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

26"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold: 
Half of 300 bikes were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold: 
15% of 300 bikes were BMX bikes, so 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold: 
Since the rest of the bikes were MTB, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 
300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each: 150 * 450 = $67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half of $500): 45 * 250 = $11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each: 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

Number of classes per week: 2 classes/day * 5 days/week = 10 classes/week
Total minutes per class: 40 minutes/class
Total minutes spent in class per week: 10 classes/week * 40 minutes/class = 400 minutes/week

Since John also spends extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the total minutes spent on these days.

Extra learning time per day: 1/16 * 60 minutes = 3.75 minutes/day
Total extra learning time per week: 3.75 minutes/day * 2 days = 7.5 minutes/week

Now, we can find the total minutes spent learning per week by adding the minutes spent in class and the extra learning time.

Total minutes spent learning per week: 400 minutes/week + 7.5 minutes/week = 407.5 minutes/week

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Total hours spent learning per week: 407.5 minutes/week / 60 = 6.79 hours/week"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

Now, we need to find the height of the ball on its second bounce. The ball will bounce to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children first.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we convert 6 feet to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of 'x', we can say that the velociraptors ate x/2 kilograms.

Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2, which gives us x = 540.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the original amount, so the T-Rex ate 540/2 = 270 kilograms. To find the initial amount, we multiply 270 by 2, which gives us 540.

Therefore, there were 540 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

540"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them up, leaving 9 unshaken sodas. Then, she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas. 

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 7 unshaken sodas. 

Now, there is 1 shaken soda left. 

The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 1/8.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/8) * 100 = 12.5%

The final answer is 12.5."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

Total distance = 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the total number of days he is available to help and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this total time per day, we need to multiply it by the number of days.

1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

1. The item that was returned is $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

2. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

3. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we add the cost of the items after the discounts to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)*(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - (x/5) = (4/5)*x.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are either large or small. Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6*15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

90"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. We can calculate Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be an error in the question. Assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income and spends 60% of her income, we can proceed.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

60% of $100,000 = 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $60,000 = -$40,000. Again, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense. Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income and spends 80% of her income.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

80% of $100,000 = 0.80 * $100,000 = $80,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $80,000 = -$60,000. This is still a negative number, which doesn't make sense. Let's try another interpretation.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Assuming she saves 20% of her income and spends the rest, we can calculate the amount she saves each year as $20,000. However, this would mean she has no expenses, which is unrealistic.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's assume the total number of students is x. Since 40% of the students are boys, the number of boys is 0.4x. We are given that the number of boys is 240. 

0.4x = 240

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the discount.

"To find the average height of the heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of heels, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total number of miles she wants to hike (9,300 miles) by the number of days in June (30 days). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is planning to hike twice a day, we need to divide the daily target by 2.

310 miles / 2 = 155 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 155 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 155"
"To find the total amount the store will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and add them together.

Red balls: 3 * $9 = $27
Blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55
Green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Total amount received: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we assume it's a typo and the question is actually asking about Pierre and Paul. 

So, Pierre and Paul together have 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

The remaining amount of apples will be 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially.

Raymond initially had $21.
He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book, so now he has $32 - $5 = $27.
He spent $19 on a puzzle, so now he has $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine the total amount of money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so the total amount spent on the books is $12 - $2 = $10.

Since Anna bought 2 books that cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($10) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$10 / 2 = $5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the original number of students and add it to the original number.

20% of 50 is 0.20 * 50 = 10.

The total number of students this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate, we divide 255 by 5:

255 / 5 = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing 459 by the rate (51 blinks per minute):

459 / 51 = 9 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fish:
Total male fish: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfish) = 11
Total female fish: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfish) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fish, subtract the total number of male fish from the total number of female fish:
16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

The final answer is 5."

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add up the time each person took to complete their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by the number of times he visits his parents in a month.

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles one way. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance he drives in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since she walks 10 miles per day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days to get 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the total distance Sofie walks (70 miles) by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since there are 5 workers in total, and 4 workers have already produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 220 - 200 = 20 toys.

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 20 / 10 = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is 2."

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight:
15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10 to find the number of small bags he can make.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags

   So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.
3. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   So, the speed of the faster car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

We know Liam is 16 now, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 

Now, we can set up the equation as follows:

14 = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago

To find Vince's age 2 years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

Vince's age 2 years ago = 14 / 2
Vince's age 2 years ago = 7

Since Vince's age 2 years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box and then multiply by the weight of each box.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds

The weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons since they are the same, so the total weight of the boxes is also 12.5 pounds.

Total weight of crayons and boxes = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet (total length) / 4 feet (log length) = 20 logs

Since John cuts 5 planks from each log, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

20 logs * 5 planks/log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2/plank = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns. 
So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. 
So, their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together.
$5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks 3 miles in total, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile. 

We know that the time spent on the sidewalk is twice the time spent on the beach. Let's denote the time spent on the beach as x. Then, the time spent on the sidewalk is 2x.

We are given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, so x = 40. 

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk: 2x = 2 * 40 = 80 minutes.

The total time spent on the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 + 80 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate the total amount she has saved so far.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 * 8 = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save the remaining amount of $28. Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. So, if he receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 
   60 - 24 = 36

2. Now that we know Bob has 36 marbles initially, we need to subtract 10 marbles from this number to find out how many marbles he will have after losing 10 marbles.
   36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, let's start by understanding the given information:

- Donny has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature.
- He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle.
- The water in the bottle is now drinkable, meaning it's at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the amount of water in the bottle becomes 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water. 

The total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. Since the water is now drinkable, the temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(4 * 33) + (1 * x) ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x ≥ 40

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 8

So, the second mug must be at least 8 degrees to make the water drinkable after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens.

For cows: 
- 20 cows are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- Total cows = 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

For chickens:
- 10 chickens are added per day for 21 days (3 weeks)
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
- Total chickens = 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost of 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 9 * 4 = 36.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding out how many scoops 3 less than 6 potatoes make. Since 6 - 3 = 3, 3 less than 6 potatoes make 3 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes 3 scoops make. Since 3 scoops are made from 3 less than 6 potatoes, we can say that 3 scoops are made from 3 potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can say that Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Since 3 scoops are made from 3 potatoes, we can divide 18 scoops by 3 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, Gomer ate 6 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We have 17 green jellybeans and 34 red jellybeans, so the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9.

The number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is 5 * 6 = 30.

To find the total number of lemons in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons per year by 10: 30 * 10 = 300.

Therefore, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade.

"To find the number of women who have remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the total parts in the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14. 

We know that the total number of passengers is 84, and the total parts in the ratio is 14. To find the value of 1 part, we divide 84 by 14, which is 6. 

Now, we multiply the value of 1 part (6) by the number of parts for women (9) to find the initial number of women on the bus: 6 * 9 = 54.

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 bouquets by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:
Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, so the total cost is 100 * 5 = $500.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks.

The total amount he earns from selling 60 rocks is 60 * 7 = $420.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money he loses:
The amount of money he loses is the difference between the total cost and the total amount he earns: 500 - 420 = $80.

Therefore, Adam loses $80.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected.

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells.

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = total number of seashells

Combine like terms:
5x + 5 = total number of seashells

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got.

Let's denote the total number of seashells as 'T'. We can rewrite the equation as:
5x + 5 = T
T = 5x + 5

Now, we know that T/3 = (5x + 5)/3

Since we don't know the exact value of T, we need to find a way to express x in terms of T. We can rewrite the equation as:
5x = T - 5
x = (T - 5)/5

Now, substitute x into the equation for the number of seashells each person got:
T/3 = ((T - 5)/5)

Multiply both sides by 15 to eliminate the fraction:
5T = 3T - 15
2T = 15
T = 7.5

Now that we know the total number of seashells, we can find out how many each person got:
T/3 = 7.5/3
Each person got 2.5 seashells.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy demand as follows:

2300 people * 20% = 2300 * 0.2 = 460 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the total demand.

460 bottles (total demand) - 4200 (current production) = - 3740 bottles

However, this is a negative number, which means Hortex already produces more than the required amount. Therefore, they don't need to produce any more bottles to meet the demand.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since it's an octuplet). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple-wearing babies is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows, so the number of purple-wearing babies with bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the purple-wearing babies with bows and the blue-wearing babies with bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, the number of blue-wearing babies is 1/4 * 8 = 2. 

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple) + 2 (blue) = 4.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of purple-wearing babies with bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from each sale.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.

He then sold 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.

Finally, he sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 30 square meters for 30 * 3 = $90.

"To find out how many dollars Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 
$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation: B = Y - 7.

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation: R = 4B.

Now, we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation: R = 4(Y - 7).

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R into this equation, we get: Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: Y + Y + 4Y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6Y - 28 = 37.

Add 28 to both sides: 6Y = 65.

Divide both sides by 6: Y = 65/6.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: B = Y - 7 = 65/6 - 7.

To simplify this expression, we can find a common denominator: B = (65 - 42)/6 = 23/6.

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4(23/6) = 92/6 = 92/6 * 1/1 = 92/6 = 15.33.

The final answer is 15.33."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

We know that 15 - x = 4/5 * 15. 

15 - x = 12

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. 

Now, we know that Rissa was given $15 and gave $3 to her sister. So, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - 3 = $12.

The question asks for the amount left in Ronnie's money. Since Ronnie was given $5 and didn't give any money to her sister, the amount left in Ronnie's money is $5.

Final answer: $5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each color as x. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also x.

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, we can set up the equation:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + x (yellow) = 12

Since half the mural is yellow, we can also say that the total amount of paint is equal to 2x (since x is the amount of yellow paint). However, this is not entirely accurate, as the total amount of paint is 12 pints, not 2x. We need to consider the entire mural, not just the yellow part.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half must be the sum of red, white, and purple paint. We can set up the equation:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) = 6 (since half the mural is 6 pints)

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, so the other half is 6 pints. Since the other half is the sum of red, white, and purple paint, we can set up the equation:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) = 6

We also know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can set up another equation:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + x (yellow) = 12

Since x (yellow) = 6, we can substitute this value into the second equation:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + 6 = 12

Now we have two equations:

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) = 6
x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + 6 = 12

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

6 = 6

This means that the amount of red, white, and purple paint is indeed 6 pints each. Since there are three colors, the total amount of paint used is 3x = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18. However, this is not the case, as the total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together:

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

"To find the number of cycles, we first need to determine the cost of the new box. Since the price remains the same ($12) and the new box has 20% more pods, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box.

Let's assume the original box has 100 pods. With 20% more pods, the new box will have 100 + (20% of 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we can calculate the cost per pod: $12 / 100 pods = $0.12 per pod.

Since you want to know how many cycles you can run for $1, we can divide $1 by the cost per pod: $1 / $0.12 = 8.33 cycles.

So, you can run approximately 8 cycles with the new box for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 / 5 = 12 five-dollar bills.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches of chalk, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

20% of 2.25 inches = 0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45 inches

Since the teacher has already used 2.25 inches, the remaining chalk is 0 inches. 

0.45 inches (used in the next 'x' days) + 2.25 inches (already used) = 0 inches (remaining chalk)

0.45x = 0

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.45:

x = 0 / 0.45
x = 0

However, this is not possible since the teacher can't use 0 inches of chalk in a day. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

The teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday and 0.45 inches on the next 'x' days. 

2.25 + 0.45x = 5 (total chalk)

0.45x = 5 - 2.25
0.45x = 2.75

x = 2.75 / 0.45
x = 6.11

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

x = 6

The teacher will have 6 days before he has to recycle the chalk."

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus returned 1600 gallons of milk, we need to calculate the total cost of the returned milk.

Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost of returned milk = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how much he can spend per school. 

Bob spends $27,000 in total and there are 3 schools. 

$27,000 / 3 schools = $9,000 per school

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find out how many books he can buy per dollar by dividing 100 by 500.

100 books / $500 = 0.2 books per dollar

Now, we can multiply the number of books per dollar by the amount he can spend per school.

0.2 books per dollar * $9,000 per school = 1800 books per school

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

Number of bags = 850 kg / 50 kg
Number of bags = 17

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 17 * $18
Total cost = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is consumed.

For the cheese pizza, 6 friends eat 6 slices each, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, 6 friends eat 4 slices each, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza to determine the number of pizzas needed.

For cheese pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas
For pepperoni pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since both types of pizzas require 3 pizzas, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 snowballs will melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 2 = 18.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 18 snowballs per hour. 

Time = Total snowballs / Net snowballs per hour
Time = 60 / 18
Time = 3.33 hours

So, it will take Jay approximately 3.33 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to determine how old John was when Digimon was released. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim at that time, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can write the equation as:

2x = 28 - x

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 28 - x
2x + x = 28
3x = 28
x = 28 / 3
x = 9.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of x to find Jim's age now.

Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release was 9.33 years. To find Jim's current age, we add the number of years that have passed since Digimon's release. However, we don't know the exact release year of Digimon. 

Assuming Digimon was released in 1999 (as it was released in 1999 in Japan), we can calculate Jim's current age as follows:

Jim's current age = 9.33 + (2023 - 1999)
= 9.33 + 24
= 33.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of Jim's age.

Jim's current age is approximately 33.33 years.

Final answer: 33.33"
"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 59 = 19.

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color. 

Total cost = $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the entire month, she will receive an additional $10 for each week. 
Total attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus
= $270 + $40
= $310

The total amount Jason earned is $8.00."
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we need to first find out how much blood a single shark has. 

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we multiply 40 by 3 to find the amount of blood in a shark: 
40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we multiply the amount of blood in a single shark by 10 to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks:
120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Number of red pens = 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens
Number of black pens = 2 * number of red pens = 2 * 25 = 50 pens

Total number of pens = number of red pens + number of black pens = 25 + 50 = 75 pens

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: 
$600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. 50% of $60 is $30. So, the cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
- White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140.

"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, so the remaining 8 gallons were divided equally among them. 

To find out how much each person got, we divide 8 by 3: 8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is 2.67."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. Let's represent the number of coffee mugs as 'x'. 

The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. 

The equation is then: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 
4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, divide both sides by 4:
x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The height of the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, the question asks for the height from the second floor's floor, which means we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor. So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. 

Let's re-evaluate the question. The question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. This means we need to find the height of the roof above the second floor. 

The height of the first floor is 180 inches, and the height of the second floor is 240 inches. The height of the roof above the second floor is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this is still not correct.

Let's re-evaluate the question again. The height of the roof above the second floor is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor. The height of the roof above the second floor is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this is still not correct.

The correct interpretation of the question is that the height of the roof above the second floor is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor. The height of the roof above the second floor is 240 - 180 = 60 inches.

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters.

"To find the total amount Stephen needs to pay, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

The total amount Stephen needs to pay is the initial $300 plus the interest, which is $300 + $6 = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

To find the amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is calculated as length * width * height = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number of red jelly beans from the true number: 900 - 202.5 = 697.5.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required for each group.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students per grade / 8 students per group = 1.25 groups per grade

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 1 group per grade. However, we have 3 grades (4-7), so we'll have 3 groups in total.

Now, we need to calculate the total time required for each group. Each group has 45 minutes to try the escape room.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies would be 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The basic manicure costs $35 and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost for both is $35 + $40 = $75. 

Since there's a 20% discount for getting both services, we calculate the discount as follows: 
20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60. 

Now, let's add the cost of nail art for each of the 10 fingers (5 fingers for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost for nail art is $3 * 10 = $30. 

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90."
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initial price in November: $40
Price in December after 80% increase: 
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Price in January after 50% decrease from December:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from each type of lesson and then add them together.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate, Charlie will earn:
4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie will earn:
2 * ($80 - 25% of $80)
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. Now, let's divide the sum by 9:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had after giving some away. Since she is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up the equation:

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we can divide the total time spent cleaning by the total hours worked and multiply by 100.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of books each shelf can hold. 

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelf can hold as 'x'. 
Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as the middle shelf, it can hold 2x books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

We know that the total number of books is 110. Since there are 3 shelves, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 110

Combine like terms:
5x - 5 = 110

Add 5 to both sides:
5x = 115

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 23

Now that we know the middle shelf can hold 23 books, we can find the number of books the bottom shelf can hold (2x = 2 * 23 = 46) and the top shelf can hold (2x - 5 = 2 * 23 - 5 = 41).

To find the total number of bookcases needed, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold. However, since the question asks for the number of bookcases, we need to consider that each bookcase has 3 shelves. 

So, we divide the total number of books by 3:
110 / 3 = 36.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the books. Therefore, Elly needs 37 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs:

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Number of eggs in 5 dozens = 60 eggs
Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per set = 20 sets
Total revenue = 20 sets * $1 per set = $20

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost of each stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks: $15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 × 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in total.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 110) + 40
Total questions = (0.7 * 110) + 40
Total questions = 77 + 40
Total questions = 117

Now, we know that Audrey got 60% of the first test correct, which is:
Correct answers in the first test = 0.6 * 70
Correct answers in the first test = 42

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of correct answers in the first test from the total number of questions:
Questions needed on the second test = Total questions - Correct answers in the first test
Questions needed on the second test = 117 - 42
Questions needed on the second test = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is equal to 116. We can write this as an equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she has played by the number of points she scores per game.

Number of games played per year: 40
Number of years: 4

Total points scored: 160 * 21 = 3360

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He then found a bead, which is not a marble, so he got rid of it. This doesn't change the number of marbles he has.

Brendan ended up with 8 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Step 2: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get from potential customers.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers to get 15 customers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 potential customers.
Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated, Jason needs 30 / 1 = 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 potential customers.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of candles and flashlights for each room and then add them together.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. 
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 candles.

Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips Mitchell has. Since he bought two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Now, we divide the total number of chips (110) by the number of family members (5) to find out how many chips each person gets. 

110 ÷ 5 = 22

So, each person gets 22 chips.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
20 * 2 = x
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 footballs, we can find the number of robots, which is half as many as helmets:
40 = (1/2) * 20
40 = 10

Now that we know there are 10 robots, 20 helmets, and 40 footballs, we can find the total number of items:
Total items = 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since he spends 6 hours per day at work, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes by multiplying 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour. 

6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day

Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, we can divide the total minutes spent on calls per day by the time it takes to deal with a single call to find the number of calls per day.

360 minutes per day / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day

To find the total number of calls per week, we multiply the number of calls per day by the number of days in a week (5).

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount of water for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water:
4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

Next, let's calculate the amount of water for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water:
8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, let's calculate the amount of water for the remaining plants. We know Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining number of plants is 20 - 12 = 8.

Since the remaining 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we can calculate the total amount of water for these plants:
8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the total amount of water needed for all the plants:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it takes Phineas to hop on land and the time it takes him to swim in the water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. Therefore, the distance on land is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to hop 100 yards is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time = 5 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Phineas to swim in the water. Since the distance in water is also 100 yards, and he swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, the time it takes him to swim 100 yards is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time = 10 minutes

Since these two times are independent of each other, we add them together to get the total time:
Total Time = Time on land + Time in water
Total Time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in June. Since June has 30 days, and he sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts per day * 30 days = 300 doughnuts per month

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, we can multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:

300 doughnuts * $2 per doughnut = $600

So, Derrick makes $600 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

"To find the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first calculate his new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we can use the formula: time = total words / speed.

time = 4500 / 375
time = 12 hours

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people on each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people for the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days (5) and add it to the total number of people for the first three days.

Total number of people for the rest of the week = 60 * 5 = 300
Total number of people for the first three days = 50 + 70 + 140 = 260
Total number of people for the week = 260 + 300 = 560

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop. 
   So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 60 seconds is 20 + 60 = 80.

3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. 
   The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   So, in the next 30 seconds, 80 * 30 = 240 kernels pop.

4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds. 
   The rate of the past 30 seconds was 80 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels per 30 seconds. 
   So, in the final 30 seconds, 40 * 30 = 120 kernels pop.

5. The total number of kernels popped in the first 120 seconds is 80 + 240 + 120 = 440.

6. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. 
   A quarter of 120 is 120 / 4 = 30. 

7. The total number of kernels popped is 440 + 30 = 470.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the amount of lemon juice required for this extra gallon. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice as the other gallons:
1 cup (for the other 4 gallons) / 2 = 0.5 cup for the extra gallon

Now, we convert this to lemons:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup
0.5 cup * 6 lemons/cup = 3 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 3 lemons = 33 lemons

"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

For the first part of the journey, Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

For the second part of the journey, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east to find the net distance from his house. Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

We know that the bag has 54 red candies. 
The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow) = 43

The number of pink candies is 43."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 5 children.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10 * 2 = 10 + 20 = 30.
4. The original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

Total meals given out = 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Total meals available = 1,360

Meals left to distribute = Total meals available - Total meals given out
= 1,360 - 142
= 1,218

Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."
"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents.
Seven dimes are worth 7 * 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

James has 105 cents.

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to first find the age of the older brother. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can find the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can find the total age of the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. 

The older brother is 24 years old, and the younger brother is 12 years old. The total age of the brothers is 24 + 12 = 36.

There are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old. The total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48.

The total age of all the siblings is 36 (brothers) + 48 (sisters) = 84.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so the total time spent on meditation per day is:
15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes

Since she practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, the total time spent on yoga per week is:
60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week:
30 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 330 minutes per week

Since there are 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is:
330 minutes per week * 4 weeks = 1320 minutes

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60:
1320 minutes / 60 = 22 hours

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total square feet of fabric needed, we need to calculate the total area of each type of shirt and then add them together.

The area of the small shirts is 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
The area of the medium shirts is 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
The area of the large shirts is 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Now, we add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

The quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, we can convert the dozen to a numerical value: 1 dozen = 12, so 3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Now, we know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5: 36 * 0.5 = 18.

To find the total number of seeds in a large sunflower, we add the 50% more seeds to the number of seeds in a small sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we can find the total number of seeds altogether by adding the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's total.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide Timothy's total by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

27"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate Anne's height by multiplying Albert's height by 2. 
Anne's height = 2 * 36"" = 72""

We also know that Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne. So, we can calculate Jackie's height by subtracting 2"" from Anne's height.
Jackie's height = 72"" - 2"" = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we can calculate her height before the summer by subtracting 3"" from her current height.
Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3"" = 67""

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means he pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.

Cost of the first T-shirt: $8
Cost of the second T-shirt: $8 * 0.5 = $4
Total cost of T-shirts: $8 + $4 = $12

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

Cost of the shoes: $40 * 0.6 = $24

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.

Total amount spent: $12 + $24 = $36

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
6 * 3 = 18

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is:
1.25 * 4 = 5

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:
18 - 5 = 13

Ryan has $13 left. Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets he can buy with $13. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we divide $13 by $6.50:
13 / 6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

"To find the total cost of making one jar of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients.

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's calculate the profit per jar:
Profit per jar = Selling price per jar - Total cost per jar
Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
Total profit = Profit per jar * 10
Total profit = $6 * 10
Total profit = $60

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, let's break down the events:

1. Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
2. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he now has:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies
3. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he now has:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
   - 4 sugar cookies (no change)
4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies
5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
   - 2 sugar cookies

Randy now has 6 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 sugar cookies.

6 oatmeal cookies + 7 chocolate chip cookies + 2 sugar cookies = 15 cookies"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

However, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, it will take him:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill in all the holes.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School
= (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School."

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes = 24 items.

We are also told that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. Since we know that Igor gathered 24 items, the number of beakers he gathered must be 29 - 24 = 5.

However, we know that Igor gathered 16 Petri dishes, so the number of beakers he gathered must be 16 + 2 = 18. 

Since we know that Igor gathered 5 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is 18 - 5 = 13.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws required for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 screws * 4 tables = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the second basket first. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so the distance Vanessa runs is 2 times the distance Aaron runs. Let's denote the distance Aaron runs as D. Then, Vanessa runs 2D.

We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, so 2D = 4. Solving for D, we get D = 2 miles.

We are also given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs D miles, his speed is D / 16. We can substitute A = 2V and D = 2 into this equation to get 2V / 16 = D / 16. Since D = 2, we can substitute this value in to get 2V / 16 = 2 / 16, which simplifies to 2V = 2. Solving for V, we get V = 1.

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race. Vanessa's speed is V = 1 mile / minute, and she runs 2 miles, so the time it took her to complete her part of the race is 2 / 1 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."

- Each meal costs $5, so 2 meals cost 2 x $5 = $10.
- They also get a $5 bottle of wine per night.
- So, the total daily revenue is $10 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15 per night.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total weekly revenue is:
$15 per night x 2 nights = $30 per week.

"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can find the cost price of one watermelon by dividing the total cost by 50 and then multiplying by 100 to get the cost price.

Cost price of one watermelon = (Total cost / 50) * 100
= ($80 / 50) * 100
= $160

Now, we can find the selling price of one watermelon by adding 25% of the cost price to the cost price.

Selling price of one watermelon = Cost price + (Cost price * 25%)
= $160 + ($160 * 0.25)
= $160 + $40
= $200

The selling price of each watermelon is $200."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.
2. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.
3. John had James when he was 19, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.
5. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find the cost of the new radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and then subtract that from the original price.

80% of $400 is 0.8 * 400 = $320.

The cost of the new radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours. So, the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation: c + b = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write another equation: 2c + 4b = 70.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2c + 4b = 70
2(c + b) = 2(20)
2c + 2b = 40

Subtracting the two equations:
(2c + 4b) - (2c + 2b) = 70 - 40
2b = 30

Dividing both sides by 2:
b = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'b' into the first equation:
c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.
