"To find out how many eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market, we need to subtract the eggs she eats and bakes for her friends from the total number of eggs laid.

She lays 16 eggs per day, eats 3 for breakfast, and bakes 4 for her friends. 
16 - 3 - 4 = 9

She sells 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 
9 * 2 = 18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to add the blue and white fibers together. 

First, we know it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
Then, it takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fibers together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 x $80,000 = $120,000. 

So, the new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so he now has $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

The profit is $150,000 - $80,000 = $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he runs per week by the distance of each sprint.

He runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs 3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week.

Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance he runs per week is 9 x 60 = 540 meters.

The answer is 540."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to first find out how many cups of feed she has already given to her chickens.

She gave 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. 
15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.

Now, we need to find out how many cups of feed she needs for each chicken. 
She has 20 chickens and has already given them 40 cups of feed. 
40 cups / 20 chickens = 2 cups per chicken.

Since she needs to give them 3 meals a day, and she has already given them 2 meals, she needs to give them 1 more meal. 
So, she needs 2 cups per chicken for the final meal. 
20 chickens * 2 cups = 40 cups.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass, then add them together.

The first glass costs $5.

The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the remaining glasses.

There are 14 glasses left after the first two glasses. The cost of these glasses will be 14 * $3 = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the first two glasses and the remaining glasses: $5 + $3 + $42 = $50.

So, Kylar needs to pay $50 for 16 glasses.

"So, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Seattle has 20 sheep, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 80 sheep, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the sheep from all three cities: Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 80 sheep, and Toulouse has 160 sheep. 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 0.8 * 200 GB = 160 GB. This takes 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes.

Then, the computer restarts and takes 20 minutes.

After the restart, Carla starts downloading again from the beginning. Since she has already downloaded 160 GB, she has 40 GB left to download. This takes 40 GB / 2 GB/minute = 20 minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes + 20 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

Then, he turns around and drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic. Since he's not moving, the distance remains the same, 180 miles.

Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

After that, he drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph. Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles.

Now, we need to add up all the distances: 180 + 180 + 15 + 160 = 435 miles.

So, John is 435 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 * $10 = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so it's 1.2 * $10 = $12. Her overtime earnings are 5 * $12 = $60.

Her total earnings for this week are $400 + $60 = $460.

$460"
"To find the total downloads, I need to calculate the downloads for each month.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the downloads were three times as many as the first month, so it had 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, I'll multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126.

Now, I'll add the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The total downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, I need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, I need to know that 1 dozen is equal to 12. 

So, the cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $330.

Now, I need to add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the profit per year.

The tree costs $90 to plant, and it grows 7 lemons per year. Each lemon is sold for $1.5. So, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 per year to water and feed the tree. So, the net profit per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90. To do this, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she has 2/3x vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she has 2/3x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she has (2/3x - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

(2/3x - 2)/2 = 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

2/3x - 2 = 10

Now, we can add 2 to both sides:

2/3x = 12

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3:

2x = 36

Finally, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

So Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16.

25% of the remaining 16 students are enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine which option is better, we need to calculate the future value of both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial price: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Future value = Initial price + (Initial price * Market increase)
= $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
= $5,000 + $125
= $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial price: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Future value = Initial price + (Initial price * Market increase)
= $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
= $8,000 + $96
= $8,096

Since $8,096 is greater than $5,125, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Future value - Initial price
= $8,096 - $8,000
= $96"
"So, the two trains are traveling westward for 80 miles each, and then they travel northwards for 150 miles. 

Since they are traveling westward for 80 miles each, that means they are 80 miles apart from each other. 

Now, when they travel northwards for 150 miles, they will be 150 miles apart from each other in the north direction. 

So, the total distance between them is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs of 80 miles and 150 miles. 

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the distance between them: 
√(80² + 150²) = √(6400 + 22500) = √26900 ≈ 164.58 miles.

Since they are 164.58 miles apart, and they traveled 80 miles westward, the distance covered by each train in the north direction is half of the total distance between them, which is 164.58 / 2 = 82.29 miles.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles (westward) + 82.29 miles (northward) = 162.29 miles.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately, then add them together.

Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher. She works 35 hours a week as a teacher. 
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Jill earns $30 per hour as a coach. She works 15 hours a week as a coach. 
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Now, let's add her weekly earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total weekly earnings.
$700/week + $450/week = $1150/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply her weekly earnings by 50 to find her annual salary.
$1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to first find out how many eggs she eats in a day. 

She makes 3 eggs every morning, so in a day, she eats 3 eggs. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide 21 eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.

21 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 1.75 dozen

So, Claire eats 1.75 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent on the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 
She spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and 1 hour on the next 2 miles. 
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we need to find the total time she needs to spend to cover the entire 12 miles at that speed. 
Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours.

Since she has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 more hour to reach her goal.

Now, we need to find the remaining distance she needs to cover. 
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered so far = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time. 
Speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph.

The answer is 6."
"To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters, we need to first calculate the total amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so we multiply 10 liters by 2/3 to find the amount of water in the orange drink: 
10 * 2/3 = 20/3 liters of water in the orange drink.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so we multiply 15 liters by 3/5 to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
15 * 3/5 = 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

Now, we add the water from both drinks: 
20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 29/3 liters of water in total.

We started with 24 liters, and 1 liter was spilled, so we subtract 1 liter from 24:
24 - 1 = 23 liters.

Now we need to subtract the total amount of water from the total amount of liquid to find the amount of the non-water part:
23 - 29/3 = 23 - 9.67 = 13.33 liters of non-water part.

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 29/3 - 1 = 9.67 liters."
"To find the answer, we need to know how old Raymond is. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's age by subtracting 6 from Samantha's age.

Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know Raymond's age and the age of his son. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the son's age from Raymond's age.

Years ago Raymond's son was born = Raymond's age - son's age
Years ago Raymond's son was born = 25 - 23
Years ago Raymond's son was born = 2

The answer is 2."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to add up the number of DVDs each customer bought.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs.

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add up all the DVDs: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find out how many centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to know how many hours the candle burns. 

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply 4 hours by 2 centimeters per hour. 

4 * 2 = 8

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price, I need to know that 100% is the original price. Since there's a 25% discount, that means 75% of the original price is $19.50. 

Let's say the original price is x. Then 75% of x is $19.50. 

0.75x = 19.50

To find x, I need to divide both sides by 0.75.

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

So the original price of the book was $26.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items she ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza is $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is 2."

For shoes: 3 pairs * $42 = $126

Now, let's add them together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"So, Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. That means she eats 1 serving per day. There are 60 days, so she eats 1 * 60 = 60 servings of ice cream.

There are 15 servings in a carton, so she needs 60 / 15 = 4 cartons of ice cream.

Each carton costs $4.00, so she will spend 4 * 4 = $16.00 on ice cream.

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to know the distance between the first stop and the end of the trip. 

The first stop was 20 miles from the start, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end. So, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 20 + 15 = 35 miles.

Now, we need to find the distance between the first stop and the second stop. Since the first stop was 20 miles from the start, and the second stop was 35 miles from the start, the distance between the first and second stops is 35 - 20 = 15 miles.

"To find out the price of the boots, we need to first find out the price of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 x $33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 11 = 18. 

We know that the total age of Darrell and Allen now is 162. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses.

The first guess is 80.
The second guess is 20 more than half of 80, which is 40. So, the second guess is 40 + 20 = 60.
The third guess is 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (25% of 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 guesses, so we divide the sum by 3: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The answer is 35."
"To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to know how many silver coins she has. Let's say she has x silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has x + 30 gold coins.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up an equation:

x (silver coins) + (x + 30) (gold coins) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

Now, let's add the points scored in both parts: 
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how many yogurts he eats in 30 days. 

He eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.

The yogurts are on sale for 4 for $5.00, so we need to find out how much 1 yogurt costs. 

We can do this by dividing $5 by 4, which is $5 ÷ 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now we can multiply the number of yogurts he eats in 30 days (60) by the cost of 1 yogurt ($1.25) to find out how much he spends on yogurt over 30 days. 

60 x $1.25 = $75

The answer is 75."
"To find out how much money John had initially, we need to calculate how much he made from selling his lego sets. He sold 13 sets for $15 each, so he made 13 x 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so he spent 8 x 20 = $160. He had $5 left, so he had 195 - 160 - 5 = $30 left.

Since he had $30 left, and he spent $15 on each lego set, he must have had 30 / 15 = 2 lego sets left.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Dana can run and walk. 

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and skipping is half as fast as running, she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can walk at a rate that is four times slower than she can run, so she can walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she is running for 6 hours, she will be running for 6 / 3 = 2 hours. 

In 2 hours, she can travel 2 * 6 = 12 miles.

In 4 hours, she will be walking. In 4 hours, she can travel 4 * 1.5 = 6 miles.

So, in 6 hours, Dana can travel 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

You have 2000 calories as your target and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since a serving has 250 calories, we need to divide 200 by 250 to find out how many servings you can have. 

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since a serving is 5 grams, we multiply 0.8 by 5 to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 * 5 = 4 grams

The answer is 4 grams."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks for each candle, and he makes 20 candles. So, the total cost is:

1 pound of beeswax and wicks = $10.00
Total cost for 20 candles = 20 x $10.00 = $200.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes 20 candles. So, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = 20 x $2.00 = $40.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"To find out how many articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday, we need to calculate 2/5 times the number of articles she wrote on Monday. 

She wrote 5 articles on Monday. 
2/5 of 5 is 2. 
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. 
She wrote 7 articles on Tuesday. 
Twice that is 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote in the three days. 
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4. 
26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first find out how many Post-it notes she used. 

She used 220 Post-it notes at work. 

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining. 

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is 220 + 23 = 243.

She initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. 

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is 243 - 80 = 163.

"To find out how many blue ties John bought, we need to divide the amount he spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie. 

$200 ÷ $40 = 5 blue ties

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40 + $40 x 0.5 = $60 each.

The total amount spent on red ties is 10 x $60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800.

The final answer is: 800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 ÷ 6 = 8

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 3/4 of 120. 

3/4 * 120 = 90 units are occupied.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to first find out how many eggs he sells per week. 

He sells 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he sells 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs per week.

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to divide 1764 by 12 to find out how many dozens he sells per week. 1764 / 12 = 147 dozen eggs per week.

He sells each dozen for $2, so he makes 147 * 2 = $294 per week.

The final answer is: 294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we can multiply the time by the speed to find the distance. 

Time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. 
Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 10 * 3 
Distance = 30 miles 

Now, we need to find the time it takes to travel 30 miles at 6 miles per hour. 
Time = Distance / Speed 
Time = 30 / 6 
Time = 5 hours 

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he's removing. 

He's removing 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and he's already removing 7.5 pounds of comic books, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds more.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find out which day had the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
6 truck tires * $60 = $360
4 car tires * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires.
12 car tires * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Jean had 30 lollipops initially. 
Jean eats 2 lollipops. 
30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.

Now, Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in one bag. 
To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2.

28 ÷ 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with lollipops.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

First, let's calculate the weight of the empty truck. Since the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds, and the driver weighs 3755 pounds, the empty truck weighs 0 pounds.

Now, we subtract the weight of the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit: 
5000 - 0 = 5000 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:
5000 / 15 = 333.33

Since we can't load a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 333.

The final answer is: 333"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total fees first. 

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00. 
25% of $40.00 is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00

Now, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the total. 
$10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00

Then, we add the tip of $4.00 to the total. 
$13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00

Finally, we add the original bill of $40.00 to the total. 
$17.00 + $40.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the clusters and the individual fruit.

There are 187 raspberries total."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

There are 1 bad, 20% unripe, and 2 sour oranges. 

20% of 25 oranges is 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges. 

So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 

25 - 8 = 17 oranges.

The answer is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of construction is $800.
The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the material and construction, which is 10% of ($500 + $800) = 10% of $1300 = 0.1 x $1300 = $130.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$500 (material) + $800 (construction) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the pension for the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years separately.

For the first 20 years, her pension is $50,000 per year.

For the remaining 10 years, her pension is 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the pension is $50,000 per year, 5% of that is $2,500. 

So, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000 (for the first 20 years) + $2,500 (for the remaining 10 years) = $52,500 per year.

52,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. There are 6 months in a half year, so she paid 6 x $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so the company charged her $140 - $14 = $126 per month. There are 6 months in the second half of the year, so she paid 6 x $126 = $756.

Now, we add the two amounts together: $840 + $756 = $1596.

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank by the amount of gas she used to fill it up.

First, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank. We know that she used 4 gallons to fill it up, and the tank holds 12 gallons. So, the amount of gas left in the tank is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons.

Now, we know that she has already traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up. To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank, we need to divide the amount of gas left in the tank by the miles she has already traveled. 

So, we divide 8 gallons by 100 miles. 

8 ÷ 100 = 0.08 miles per gallon.

To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank. 

0.08 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 0.96 miles.

So, Sophia can drive approximately 0.96 miles per gallon."
"To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

He spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 2 * 3 = 6 hours watching TV per week.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 1 * 3 = 3 hours reading per week.

Now, let's add the hours he spends on TV and reading per week: 6 + 3 = 9 hours per week.

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the hours per week by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to know the number of each type of gem. 

Let's start with the diamonds. We know there are 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so we subtract 35 from 175. 
175 - 35 = 140 rubies.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we multiply 140 by 2.
140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

Now, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together to find the total number of gems.
175 + 140 + 280 = 595

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."

"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days. She feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for 180 days. So, the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days is 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

Now, let's calculate the amount of dog food she will use for the rest of her life. Since the puppy will live for the rest of its life, we need to know how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year. So, the puppy will live for 365 - 180 = 185 days.

Since she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, the total amount of dog food she will use for the rest of its life is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

Now, let's add the amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the rest of her life. The total amount of dog food she will use is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to calculate the amount of potato salad for the adults and the children separately.

First, we need to find out how much potato salad the adults will eat. There are 20 adults, and each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad. So, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is 20 x 10 = 200 lbs.

Next, we need to find out how much potato salad the children will eat. There are 5 children, and each child eats half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. So, the total amount of potato salad for the children is 5 x 5 = 25 lbs.

Now, we need to add the amount of potato salad for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring. 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

The final answer is: 225"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Cindy has 4 pets. 
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. 
Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: Cindy has 4, Marcia has 6, and Jan has 18. 
4 + 6 + 18 = 28

The total number of pets the three have is 28."

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles. 

Since Lee used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs 38 seconds, we can subtract 2 seconds from Lee's time to find Gerald's original time. 

Gerald's original time = Lee's time - 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 - 2
Gerald's original time = 36 seconds

Now, we know Gerald's original time, and we also know that his diet improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we need to multiply his original time by 1.1 (which is 100% + 10%).

Gerald's new time = Gerald's original time * 1.1
Gerald's new time = 36 * 1.1
Gerald's new time = 39.6 seconds

The final answer is: 39.6"
"To find the number of cats, we need to know that there are two cats for every dog. Since there are 60 dogs, we multiply 60 by 2 to get the number of cats. 

60 * 2 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we add the number of dogs and cats, then subtract 12.

60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180
180 - 12 = 168

There are 168 rabbits. 

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"To find the number of girls, we first need to find the total number of girls. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, that means 3/5 of the students are girls. 

3/5 of 200 is (3/5) * 200 = 120. So, there are 120 girls.

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 2/3 of 120 is (2/3) * 120 = 80. 

So, 80 girls are in the girl scout. 

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract 80 from 120. 120 - 80 = 40.

The answer is 40."
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is 6. 

James slept 6 hours.

9 - 6 = 3

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, she used half of the 32 ounces of sauce. 

Half of 32 ounces is 32 / 2 = 16 ounces. 

Now, we know that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many tomatoes she used, we need to divide the ounces of tomatoes she used by 16 and then multiply by 3.

16 ounces / 16 = 1
1 * 3 = 3

So, Freda used 3 tomatoes.

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that took an exit and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars.

First, let's find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total. We know that there were originally 30 cars, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first find out how many potted plants she has in total. 

She has 18 new potted plants and 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, let's find out how many potted plants she has on the window ledges. 
2 potted plants per ledge * 40 ledges = 80 potted plants

Now, let's add the new potted plants she received. 
80 potted plants + 18 new potted plants = 98 potted plants

She is giving 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. 
There are 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

Now, let's subtract the potted plants she gave away from the total number of potted plants she had. 
98 potted plants - 40 potted plants = 58 potted plants

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

58"
"To find the answer, we need to follow the given information step by step.

The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
So, the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
Since the first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The total number of doorbell rings is the sum of the doorbell rings from all friends.
Total doorbell rings = 60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175.

The answer is 140."
"To find out how many pieces Poppy has left, we need to follow the steps.

First, Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board. A quarter of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.

Now, she has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces on the board. A third of 750 is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, Poppy has 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

The answer is 500."
"So, if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody eats three times as many, which is 3 x 5 = 15 cookies.

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first find out how many hours he watched on Wednesday. 

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours. 

So, the total hours he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. 

Since he watched 7 hours in total, the hours he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours. 

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1.5 hours is 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. 

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. 90 minutes divided by 30 minutes is 3. 

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

He realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine the constants:
2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:
2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"So, the gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and the cashback is $0.20 per gallon. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the gas: 
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

Now, let's calculate the cashback: 
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, let's subtract the cashback from the total cost: 
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, the person will pay $28.00 for 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards.

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups for both Beatrice and Marcell: 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

They ate 45 fruit roll-ups on average."
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to first find out how many times Julia rowed 20 feet. 

She took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so to find out how many 20-foot segments she rowed in 64 seconds, we divide 64 by 16. 

64 / 16 = 4

So, Julia rowed 4 times 20 feet. 

4 * 20 = 80 feet

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in 80 feet. 

80 / 10 = 8

So, the boat took on 8 times 2 liters of water. 

8 * 2 = 16 liters

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

1800 / 6 = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

So, we can divide 300 by 50 to find out how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

300 / 50 = 6

"To find out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the lumber.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:

- 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards cost $10 each, so 10 x $10 = $100
- 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each, so 5 x $16 = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Now, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber. Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to add 50% of the total cost to the total cost.

50% of $180 = 0.5 x $180 = $90

Total selling price = $180 + $90 = $270

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $270 - $180
= $90

The final answer is: 90"

30 - 10 = 20

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide 20 by 5 to find the number of containers on the second day.

20 / 5 = 4

So, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we need to calculate 30% of Adrien's salary four years ago and subtract that from his salary. 

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
30% of $40,000 is 0.3 * 40,000 = $12,000. 
Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000 - $12,000 = $28,000.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. 
His salary increased by 40% of his salary four years ago. 
40% of $40,000 is 0.4 * 40,000 = $16,000. 
Adrien's salary four years later is $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

Lylah's salary four years later is 40% more than her salary four years ago. 
40% of $28,000 is 0.4 * 28,000 = $11,200. 
Lylah's salary four years later is $28,000 + $11,200 = $39,200.

We know that she had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

To solve for x, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation:

x + 5 = 12 + 3

2 cookies for $1.00 each is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

The total cost so far is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip, so the final total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark completed in the first test, we need to multiply the number of questions by the time he spent on it.

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100

"To find the number of worker bees, we need to know the number of queens first. Let's say the number of queens is x. 

Since there are twice as many babies as queens, the number of babies is 2x. 

Since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, the number of worker bees is 2 * 2x = 4x.

We know that the total number of bees is 700. So, the sum of worker bees, babies, and queens is 700. 

4x + 2x + x = 700

Combine like terms: 7x = 700

Divide both sides by 7: x = 100

Now that we know the number of queens is 100, we can find the number of worker bees: 4x = 4 * 100 = 400

Total packs of cloths needed = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Total cost of bleach = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses = $32 + $40 = $72

Now, we subtract the total expenses from the total income to find the profit.
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to first find out how many pineapples he can harvest in a month.

There are 100 pineapples per hectare, and John has 10 hectares. So, he can harvest 100 x 10 = 1000 pineapples in a year.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to divide 1000 by 3 to find out how many pineapples he can harvest in a month.

1000 ÷ 3 = 333.33

So, John can harvest approximately 333 pineapples in a month.

Now, to find out how many pineapples he can harvest in a year, we multiply 333 by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

333 x 12 = 4000

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. 

1/2 of 30 is 15, so 15 bees return in the next 6 hours.

Now, Debra sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Two times 30 is 60, so 60 bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before that hadn't already returned. We already know 15 bees returned in the first 6 hours, so 30 - 15 = 15 bees left in the first 6 hours. Now, 60 bees left in the next 6 hours, so 15 + 60 = 75 bees left in total.

Now, we need to find out how many bees return in the last 6 hours. All the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive in the next 6 hours. So, 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The answer is 75."

Tim's time:
Distance = 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet

Time = 2 * 5280 / 264
Time = 4 minutes

Since Steve's time (6.18 minutes) is more than Tim's time (4 minutes), Steve wins the race.

To find out how long the loser will wait, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.
Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time
Waiting time = 4 - 6.18
Waiting time = -2.18 minutes

Since you can't wait a negative time, we need to take the absolute value of the waiting time.
Waiting time = 2.18 minutes

"To find out how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 x 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 500 cents is equal to 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each day and then multiply it by the number of days in a week.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. 
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day.

Since there are 4 days with 3 hours and 2 days with 4 hours, we can calculate the total hours per week as follows:
3 * 4 = 12 hours for the 3-hour days
4 * 4 = 16 hours for the 4-hour days
Total hours per week = 12 + 16 = 28 hours

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the total hours per week by 16:
28 * 16 = 448 hours

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each item to feet. 
- A roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- A croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- A baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:
- 300 rolls: 300 * 1/3 = 100 feet
- 120 croissants: 120 * 1/2 = 60 feet
- 60 baguettes: 60 * 2 = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths together: 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet.

"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to add up the bananas needed by all the apes.

The monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. Since the zookeeper orders every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly amount by 2.

Monkeys: 200 * 2 = 400
Gorillas: 400 * 2 = 800
Baboons: 100 * 2 = 200

Now, let's add them up: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate how far each person ran.

Blake ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly ran back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she ran to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. So, she ran 100 + 80 = 180 yards. She did this 34 times, so she ran 180 * 34 = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is more than 1500 yards, Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we need to subtract 1500 from 6120. 6120 - 1500 = 4620.

The answer is 4620."
"To find out how much Raphael spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items.

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens: 4 pens * $1.5 each = $6

Next, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4 each = $8

Now, let's add the cost of the pens, notebooks, and the bond paper: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34

So, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

"To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles he initially saw.

Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out from under a lily pad.
2 tadpoles hid under a rock.

So, we subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles he initially saw:
11 - 6 = 5
5 - 2 = 3

Finn can see 3 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the steps:

1. The tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday, so we add 7 feet to the initial depth of 17 feet.
   17 + 7 = 24 feet

2. The depth of the water on Wednesday is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.
   24 * 2/3 = 48/3 = 16 feet

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"Let's break it down step by step:

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's fish: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's fish: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
Total fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

The final answer is: 32"

"To find the cost of the action figure, we need to know the cost of one red car. Since one red car costs $4 and one action figure costs $5, we can't directly compare them. However, we know the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. 

Let's start by finding the cost of the doll. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and one action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we know the doll costs $15. We also know that one red car costs $4. We need to find the cost of 5 red cars. 5 red cars will cost 5 * $4 = $20.

Now, we have the costs of all the toys: 
- 5 red cars: $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

The total cost of all toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself. She'll lose 3 hours of work at $35/hour, so she'll lose 3 x $35 = $105.

Now, let's calculate the money she'll have if she hires the accountant. She'll pay $90 for the accountant's services.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the money she'll lose by doing her taxes herself: $105 - $90 = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's break it down. 

We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. Let's say Brooke's age is x. Then Seth's age is 2x.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2.

The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can write the equation: 
x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28

Combine like terms: 
3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides: 
3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 8

So, Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

She has three debts: 
- Student loans: $300 (minimum payment) + 50% of $300 = $300 + $150 = $450
- Credit card: $200 (minimum payment) + 50% of $200 = $200 + $100 = $300

"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. 

First, we need to convert the time it takes to peel a potato into seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 1.5 minutes is 1.5 x 60 = 90 seconds.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time it takes to prep one potato by 60. 95 seconds x 60 = 5700 seconds.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide 5700 by 60 to get the total minutes. 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first figure out how many gallons they made. 

They sell 20 glasses per gallon and they made $25 in profit. Since each glass is $0.50, they made 25 / 0.5 = 50 glasses. 

Since they made 50 glasses and they get 20 glasses per gallon, they made 50 / 20 = 2.5 gallons.

Now, we know they made 2.5 gallons and each gallon costs $3 for lemons. So, they spent 2.5 * 3 = $7.50 on lemons.

2. Calculate the amount Zaid spends on car fuel: 
   1/3 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/3 = 2000

3. Calculate the total amount spent so far: 
   1500 + 2000 = 3500

4. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel: 
   6000 - 3500 = 2500

5. Calculate the amount Zaid donates to charity: 
   Half of 2500 = 2500 * 1/2 = 1250

6. Calculate the remaining amount after donation:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. 

Let's say the number of white carnations is x. Then, the number of red roses is 4x, and the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200. 

Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 40. 

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses, which is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years. 
So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so Mark's current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how long it will take the less well-rounded team to complete the 4x400 meter relay, we need to calculate the time for each runner.

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first runner, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add up the time for all four runners: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per runner, so we multiply 55 by 4: 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of two things: 

1. Rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.
2. Rolling two even numbers in a row.

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

For the first case, there are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

For the second case, there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 or 1/2. Since Jerry is rolling the die twice, we need to multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we need to find the difference between these two probabilities. To do this, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to first find out the total number of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits.

For the hamsters: 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster = 50 pieces of straw
For the rabbits: 20 pieces of straw

Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits: 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

Now, we subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we divide the remaining straw by 6 to find out the number of rats: 90 / 6 = 15

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages, we divide the number of rats by 3 to find out the number of rats in each cage: 15 / 3 = 5

"To find out how much Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest first. 

The interest is 2% of $100, which is 0.02 x $100 = $2. 

Since Mandy paid the debt after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months. 

The interest for 1 month is $2, so for 3 months it's $2 x 3 = $6.

Now, we add the interest to the original amount: $100 + $6 = $106.

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost. The cost of buying the bags is $20 per bag, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2. Let's say the trader bought x bags.

The total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The total revenue is $30 per bag, and the trader made a profit of $400. So, the total revenue is 30x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. We know the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 50

So, the trader bought 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

$20.25 (tickets) - $4.50 (food) = $15.75 (food)

Now, let's add the cost of the rides to the total cost. 

$20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $33 (ride 1) + $33 (ride 2) = $88.00

Now, we need to divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each person paid. 

$88.00 ÷ 3 = $29.33

The final answer is: $29.33"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he can collect per minute.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, John collects peaches for 3 hours, which is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

He can collect 2 peaches per minute. So, in 180 minutes, he can collect 2 x 180 = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7.

First, we need to convert 3.5 pounds to a decimal by dividing by 10 (since there are 10 tenths in 1 pound). 
3.5 ÷ 10 = 0.35 pounds per day for one duck.

Now, we multiply 0.35 pounds by 10 to find out how many pounds one duck needs per day.
0.35 x 10 = 3.5 pounds per day for one duck.

Now, we multiply 3.5 pounds by 10 to find out how many pounds the whole flock needs per day.
3.5 x 10 = 35 pounds per day for the whole flock.

The final answer is: 35"
"So Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. That means he has 10 - 2 = 8 more trees each year. 

So after 10 years, he has 50 + (10 * 10) = 50 + 100 = 150 trees. 

Then 30% of the trees die. 30% of 150 is 0.3 * 150 = 45. So 45 trees die. 

Now he has 150 - 45 = 105 trees left.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. The neighbors started with 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. They took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, they have 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.
3. They painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Now, they have 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
4. Then, they added 18 more pink plastic flamingos. Now, they have 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
5. To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos are out than white plastic flamingos, we need to subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos. 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to first find out how many pounds of carrots will be used. 

There are 40 restaurants, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. So, the total pounds of carrots used will be 40 * 2 = 80 pounds.

Now, we need to subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available. 

200 - 80 = 120 pounds.

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."

Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 x 20 = 60 cards. So now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 x (20 + 60) = 2 x 80 = 160 cards. So now she has 120 + 160 = 280 cards.

"To find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher, we need to divide the total number of sentences by 2. 

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher.

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we multiply the number of sentences by the rate.

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, we multiply the amount by 2.

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents.

Now, we add the amount from both publishers to find the total amount Mark makes in a week.

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

So, his new salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100. 

Now, let's calculate how much he made in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year. 

$2000 x 52 = $104,000.

5 tons/acre * 10 acres = 50 tons

Now, we need to find out how many barrels of wine those 50 tons make. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply 50 tons by 2.

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days, and he used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. So he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet. That's 3 days * 3 slices = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

He also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, and he used 8 slices of cheese in it.

So, let's add all the slices of cheese together: 14 slices for lunch + 9 slices for breakfast + 8 slices for dinner = 31 slices of cheese.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates. 

A dozen is 12, so 20 dozen cups is 20 x 12 = 240 cups.

Half a dozen is 6, so half a dozen plates is 6.

The cost of 20 dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of 6 plates. So, the cost of 6 plates is $1200 more than the cost of 20 dozen cups.

The cost of 6 plates is $6000. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $4800. To find the cost of one cup, we divide $4800 by 240 cups.

$4800 ÷ 240 cups = $20 per cup.

The total cost of buying each cup is $20."

"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables. Let's say the number of red chickens is 'r' and the number of white chickens is 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs can be represented as 3r + 5w.

Since w = r + 2, we can substitute this into the equation 3r + 5w. This gives us 3r + 5(r + 2).

Now we can simplify the equation: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42.

Combine like terms: 8r + 10 = 42.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 8r = 32.

Divide both sides by 8: r = 4.

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5) 
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we need to divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find out how many hours he spends walking.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to know how many customers she counted on the first day. 

Let's say the number of customers on the first day is x. 
On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50. 
The total number of customers on the third day is 500. 

We can write an equation to represent this: 
x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500 

Combine like terms: 
3x + 100 = 500 

Subtract 100 from both sides: 
3x = 400 

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 133.33 

Since we can't have a fraction of a customer, we'll round down to 133 customers on the first day. 

Now, we can find the number of customers on the second day: 
x + 50 = 133 + 50 = 183 

Now, we can find the number of customers on the third day: 
x + 50 + x + 50 = 133 + 183 = 316

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool lost 4 gallons in 4 minutes, and the big pool lost 4 * 2 = 8 gallons in 4 minutes.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This means the big pool has 4x gallons of water now, and the small pool has x gallons of water now.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to add the cost of the shoes and the belt together. 

$320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, we need to divide the total amount she needs ($352.00) by her hourly wage ($8.00) to find out how many hours she needs to work.

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"To find the total amount Janeth needs to pay back, we first need to calculate the additional amount she needs to pay, which is 10% of $2000. 

10% of $2000 is 0.1 x $2000 = $200.

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay back is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since Janeth is paying $165 a month for 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she pays in 12 months.

$165 x 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount she pays from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.

$2200 (total amount) - $1980 (total paid) = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. 
Then, we know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

There are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"To find the ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to know Harriet's age. Harriet is 21 years old now. 

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.

In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old, and Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores. 
68 + 44 + 85 = 197

Since the total points of all four students is 251, we can subtract the points of the three students from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
251 - 197 = 54

Jojo scored 54 points."

Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
Water used by Celine = 90 liters
Water left in the tank = 120 - 90 = 30 liters

Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. 
So, the amount of rainwater collected = 2 * 30 = 60 liters

Now, let's add the water left in the tank and the rainwater collected.
Total water in the tank now = 30 + 60 = 90 liters

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards left.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

Now, the total number of cards is 90 - 8 = 82 (since he lost 8 cards) and then 82 + 14 = 96 (since he bought 14 cards).
Total cards = 96

Now, we can find the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
(32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."
"To find out how much Chad owes, we need to add up the cost of the base burrito, the extra items, and the upgrade, then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito is $6.50.
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, and avocado for $1.00. That's $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $4.00.
He also adds 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so that's $0.50.
The total cost of the extra items is $4.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The base burrito is $6.50, and the extra items are $4.50, so the total cost so far is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so he subtracts that from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Chad owes $9.00."
"To find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can put together per minute, we need to add their rates. 

Kalinda can put 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can put half as many, so her mom can put 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Each person sends 2 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, he sends 2 letters a week to each of the 3 people. That's 2 * 3 = 6 letters per week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes. So, he writes 30 pages per week in 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he writes 180 / 60 = 3 hours per week."

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find out the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 x 60 = 30. So, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

Now, we know that the total number of boys in the school is 30 and the number of girls in the third class is 3. To find out the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls in the third class from the total number of boys in the school.

Then, he downloaded 18 more apps, so we add 18 to 52: 52 + 18 = 70

Travis now has 70 apps on his tablet.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.

Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves today.

He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed:
10 wolves (last night) + 45 wolves (today) = 55 wolves
15 cougars (last night) + 12 cougars (today) = 27 cougars

So, Rick killed a total of 55 + 27 = 82 animals.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first find out how many times Anne went down. 

Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we need to find 30% of 30. 
30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down 4 x 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to know how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. 

There were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so there were 10 x 20 = 200 cows. 

Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and adds them to the 200 cows. So, there are now 200 + 40 = 240 cows.

Now, Mr. Sylas divides the 240 cows equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows are in each stall, we divide 240 by 20. 

240 ÷ 20 = 12

So, there are 12 cows in each stall. 

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply 12 by 8. 

12 x 8 = 96

The answer is 96."
"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

Pennies are worth 1 cent each, so 100 pennies are worth 100 cents, which is $1.

Nickels are worth 5 cents each, so 40 nickels are worth 40 * 5 = 200 cents, which is $2.

Dimes are worth 10 cents each, so 20 dimes are worth 20 * 10 = 200 cents, which is $2.

Dollar bills are worth $1 each, and Brady has 40 of them, so they are worth 40 * $1 = $40.

Now, let's add all the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45.

Brady has $45 in his piggy bank.

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to first find the total weight of the wood. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we need to divide 200 feet by 10 to find out how many sections there are. 
200 / 10 = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section. 
20 * 400 = 8000 pounds

The termites ate 30% of the wood. To find 30% of 8000 pounds, we multiply 8000 by 0.3. 
8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the wood. 
8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy owes, first, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books. 

She owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books, so we multiply 8 by 0.50. 
8 * 0.50 = 4.00

Then, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book over a week overdue. 
4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00

So, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and she has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Since Jamal has 44 apples, he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Since Jamal has 48 bananas, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits:
Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so the total number of fruits is 52 + 24 = 76.

76"
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12, since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies.

She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. 
36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Now, we divide 66 by 12 to find out how many cups of flour she needs:
66 ÷ 12 = 5.5 cups

So Carla needs 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find two thirds of 9,300 pennies, I need to multiply 9,300 by 2/3. 

First, I'll convert 2/3 to a decimal: 2/3 = 0.67

Now, I'll multiply 9,300 by 0.67: 
9,300 * 0.67 = 6,201

So, there are 6,201 pennies in two thirds of the cup.

To find the dollar amount, I'll divide 6,201 by 100 (since there are 100 pennies in a dollar): 
6,201 / 100 = 62.01

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is 62.01 dollars.

"To find out how many trees Ferdinand has, we need to divide the number of trees Chris has by 2. 
Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Now, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. 
Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. 
Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 
So, Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has. 
11 - 3 = 8

"Let's break it down:

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we add their amounts together: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

The selling price is $350,000.
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500.
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:

$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000

Now, let's add the transfer fees and brokerage fee to the selling price: 
Total amount paid = $400,000 + $12,000 + $20,000 = $432,000

Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds: 
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $432,000 = -$32,000

However, since Mr. Tan paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount, we need to subtract this amount from the net proceeds: 
Net proceeds = -$32,000 - $250,000 = -$282,000

The final answer is: -282,000"
"To find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

Now, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat up the oil. 

So, it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Now, we need to add the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken. 

Total time = 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of newspaper ads and television ads separately.

Cost of newspaper ads: 
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Total cost of newspaper ads = 50 * 5 = $250

Cost of television ads:
Number of television ads = 15
Cost per television ad = $75
Total cost of television ads = 15 * 75 = $1125

Total amount spent = Cost of newspaper ads + Cost of television ads
Total amount spent = $250 + $1125
Total amount spent = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so we divide 16 by 2 to find the number of golf balls: 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls.

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. So, we divide the number of golf balls by 2 again: 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

"To find the total number of M&Ms, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add up the number of M&Ms in all three bags: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we need to multiply the number of houses by the number of bedrooms per house and then multiply that by the number of windows per bedroom.

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house = 6 bedrooms
6 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows in the bedrooms

Now, we need to add the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, so we multiply that by the number of houses.

4 windows per house * 2 houses = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.

12 windows in the bedrooms + 8 windows = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches the collar takes, we need to calculate a tenth of 900. 
A tenth of 900 is 900 / 10 = 90.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 x 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches is 1800. We also know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 
So, the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches. 
1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we need to divide the total number of stitches by 2. 
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The answer is 315."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The solo song has 54 lines.
2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines.
3. Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines, so he has 1/3 * 108 = 36 lines from the first scene.
4. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
5. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines, so he has 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize: 36 (from the first scene) + 48 (from the second scene) + 54 (from the song) = 138.

"To find out how many cards had the letter D, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we find out how many cards had the letter A on them: 2/5 of 80 is 2/5 * 80 = 32 cards.
2. Then, we subtract the cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48 cards.
3. Next, we find out how many of the remaining cards had the letter B: 1/2 of 48 is 1/2 * 48 = 24 cards.
4. Then, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24 cards.
5. Now, we find out how many of the remaining cards had the letter C: 5/8 of 24 is 5/8 * 24 = 15 cards.

"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. Since we don't have that information, let's assume their current ages are x and y.

We know that the sum of their current ages is 20, so we can write an equation: x + y = 20.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages. So, in 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's break it down. 

If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can say Ruby's age is 6 times Sam's age. Let's call Sam's age 'x'. Then Ruby's age is 6x.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be 6x + 9 and Sam's age will be x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can set up the equation: 
6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get: 
6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get: 
3x + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get: 
3x = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: 
x = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

There are 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, so the total space taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

Since the necklace is 25 inches long, the space left for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, so the number of beads that can fit in 17 inches is 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find out how many meals the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal. Since there are 5 members and each consumes 0.2 kg of rice, the total amount of rice consumed per meal is 5 x 0.2 = 1 kg.

Since they eat rice for both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 1 kg x 2 = 2 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (2 kg). 

42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total number of days by 7 to find out how many weeks the rice will last.

21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks.

"Let's break it down step by step:

Sam's target is 120 crates. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only worked 3 days. 

On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he worked 2 days less than the target. 
So, the total number of days he should have worked is 5 days.

Total crates he should have sold = 120 * 5 = 600 crates

Now, let's find out how many crates he was short of his target:
600 - 45 = 555

So, Sam was 555 crates short of his target for the week."

"To find out how many miles John drives in a year, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year. 

He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, so that's 60 miles per day. He does this 5 days a week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 miles per week. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, he drives 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles per year.

He gets charged $2 per mile driven, so he pays 15,000 * 2 = $30,000 per year for driving.

He also gets a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so he gets 150 * 12 = $1,800 per year for the bonus.

In total, John pays $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 per year for driving.

"To find out how much Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday, we need to add the time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Total time so far: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the total time by 2.

2 x 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To make a tabloid, you need to fold the paper in half, then fold it in half again. This creates 4 sections: 
- Left back (pages 1-16)
- Left front (pages 17-32)
- Right back (pages 33-48)
- Right front (pages 49-64)

Since the paper is folded in half twice, you would need 2 pieces of paper to make a 32-page tabloid.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to know how many books she sold in the second year. 

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the second year. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 90 + 45 = 135.

Since the total number of books sold is 200, the number of books sold in the third year is 200 - 135 = 65.

Now, we know that she sold 45 books this year and 65 books in the third year. We also know that she sold 90 books in the first year. 

To find the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we need to know the price of each book. We know that each book sells at 20$. 

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = 900."
"So, Watson works 5 days a week, and he works 10 hours a day. That means he works 5 x 10 = 50 hours a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, he works 50 x 4 = 200 hours in April.

He earns $10 per hour, so he earns 200 x 10 = $2000 in April from his regular pay. He also gets a $300 bonus for the whole month, so his total earnings are $2000 + $300 = $2300.

The final answer is: $2300"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20 * 0.2 (since 80% is the same as 0.8).

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find out how many loaves are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we multiply 60 by 2/3.

60 * 2/3 = 40 loaves

2. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. We subtract the morning sales from the total number of loaves.

60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we divide the remaining loaves by 2.

20 / 2 = 10 loaves

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we need to divide the total weight he loses by the number of weeks it takes him to lose that weight. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Sandy by the amount of weight Joey loses per week. 

2 pounds per week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $0.5 = $2.

The total cost of the items is $22 + $2 = $24.

The original price of the items is 2 x $13 + 4 x $0.5 = $26 + $2 = $28.

To find out how much you'll save, we subtract the total cost from the original price: $28 - $24 = $4.

"To find out how many new limbs the person will grow, we need to calculate the number of times the person will get an extra arm and an extra leg in 15 days.

For the extra arm, the person will get one every 3 days. 
15 days / 3 days per arm = 5 extra arms

For the extra leg, the person will get one every 5 days.
15 days / 5 days per leg = 3 extra legs

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs.

5 + 3 = 8

"To find out how much money Theo has, we need to calculate the cost of the items he bought and subtract the money he saved.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each is 6 x $100 = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each is 3 x $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 x $100 = $500. 
Adding $700 to that makes $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the costs of the items: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Since Theo wants to save $2000, he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left.

The answer is: $4050"

1. First, I need to find Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. 
2. Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 6000.
4. Since the population six years ago was half of the current population, the current population is 6000 * 2 = 12000.

The population of Chile now is 12000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is x.

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"To find out how many people came to Martha's party, we need to first find out how many people were invited. 

There were 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 x 6 = 12 people. 
There were 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 people. 
So, in total, Martha invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. That leaves 24 - 8 = 16 people.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. 
So, 2 people didn't come to the party.

Now, we subtract the people who didn't come from the total number of people invited: 24 - 2 = 22 people.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles. 

Now, Solomon has 20 + 8 = 28 marbles. 

The store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles is 28 + 50 = 78.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10.

So, 10 people left the party. 

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were originally 25 men, 25 - 22 = 3 men left.

We also know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

There were originally 15 women, and 7 left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find out how many pencils Jam has in total, we need to add the pencils in the boxes and the loose pencils. 

Since we don't know how many pencils are in each box, let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2.

We also know that Meg has 46 pencils. 

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is 3x + 2 + 46.

We are told that the total number of pencils is 26. So, we can set up the equation: 
3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Now, let's solve for x:
3x + 48 = 26
3x = -22
x = -22/3
x = -7.33 (we can't have a fraction of a pencil, so this doesn't make sense)

However, let's re-evaluate the problem. We can try to find a different solution. 

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and the total number of pencils is 26. We can set up the equation:
3x + 2 = 26
3x = 24
x = 8

So, Jam has 8 pencils in each box. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:
Jam has 3x + 2 = 3(8) + 2 = 26 pencils
Meg has 46 pencils
Total pencils = 26 + 46 = 72

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 
3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 
3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 70

Now that we know x, we can find the number of students in the smallest group: 
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how many chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, we know he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's say he has x cows. Then, he has 2x chickens. 

Since he has 60 animals in total, we can write the equation: x + 2x = 60. 

Combine like terms: 3x = 60. 

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20. 

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens. 

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

The total number of legs is: 40 * 2 + 20 * 4 = 80 + 80 = 160. 

The final answer is: 160"
"Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week. So, after 4 weeks, he had 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls. 

When he dropped 3 balls, 2 were caught, so he lost 1 ball. 

So, Josh started juggling with 6 - 1 = 5 balls."
"To find the weight of the blue beetle, I need to know the weight of the pink frog. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds. 

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, I need to add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container. 

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds.

"To find the total number of outfits, we need to add the outfits Laurel received from her friend, the baby shower, and her mom.

Laurel received 24 outfits from her friend.
She received twice that amount at the baby shower, so she got 2 x 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gave her 15 more outfits.

Now, let's add them all together: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87

Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby.

"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to first find out the price of Juice Box B. 

Since Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A is 4 dollars, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Now, Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C. 11 - 9 = 2.

Now, let's add the legs together: 160 + 150 = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first find out how many cookies are left after her son and husband eat their share.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

In total, they eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

The bag has 36 cookies, so there are 36 - 27 = 9 cookies left.

Jenny eats the rest of the cookies, which is 9 cookies.

"To find out how much Davos paid, we need to first find the total cost of the shirts before the discount. 

The cost of 2 shirts is 2 x $30 = $60. 

Then, we need to find 40% of $60. 
40% of $60 is 0.4 x $60 = $24. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost. 
$60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"So, they used to make 10 tractors a day and sold them for $100 each. That's 10 x $100 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make 5 silos a day and sell them for $220 each. That's 5 x $220 = $1100 per day.

To find the difference, we need to subtract the old amount from the new amount: $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we need to divide the difference by the old amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) x 100 = 10%.

So, they are making 10% more per day now.

"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per month, we need to add the costs of food, treats, and medicine. 

First, we need to find out how much she spends on food per month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the cost of food per week by 4. 
$25 per week * 4 weeks = $100 per month

Now, we add the cost of treats and medicine to the cost of food. 
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month

To find out how much she spends on her dog per year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 
$220 per month * 12 months = $2640 per year

The final answer is: 2640"

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first find out how much time he spent in total.

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

Now, let's add up the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

This is 30% of the total time he spent. To find the total time, we need to divide 15 by 30% (or 0.3). 

15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Now that we know the total time, we can find out how much time he spent sightseeing. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we need to multiply 50 by 40% (or 0.4).

50 * 0.4 = 20 hours.

The answer is 20."
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs, we need to calculate how much she earned from her jobs and add it to her initial savings.

She earns $10 per hour at her first job and worked for 20 hours, so she earned 10 * 20 = $200.

She earns $5 per hour at her second job and worked for 15 hours, so she earned 5 * 15 = $75.

Now, let's add her earnings to her initial savings: $80 + $200 + $75 = $355.

To find out how much she still needs, we subtract her total earnings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

Annabelle still needs $45 to buy the phone.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate how much money she has left after buying the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the mini-golf and arcade tokens:
- 1 round of mini-golf costs $5
- Arcade tokens cost $5
Total cost for mini-golf and arcade tokens: $5 + $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the go-kart rides:
- 2 go-kart rides cost $10 each
Total cost for go-kart rides: $10 * 2 = $20

Now, let's add the total cost of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides:
$10 + $20 = $30

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to subtract the total cost from her budget:
$90 - $30 = $60

Since each friend will cost $0 (assuming they don't have any expenses), we can divide the remaining budget by $0:
$60 / $0 = 60

So, Morgan can invite 60 friends to her party.

Since 100 cents is equal to $1, she spends $1 on lollipops.

Now, we need to find out how much she saves. 
$5 (her daily allowance) - $1 (lollipops) = $4

She saves $4 for 5 days. 
$4 * 5 = $20

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $.05 each, so he spent 40 x $.05 = $2 on gumballs.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, that means he had $2 left. He started with $10, so he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs and $8 is left. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially, and he spent $8 on gumballs. So, he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to divide the amount he spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$2 ÷ $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Carver's son is x years old. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

Carver's age = 2 * son's age - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Now, we need to solve for x. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:
45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Next, divide both sides by 2:
50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities.

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles

Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance by the service interval.

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 675 miles is less than 18,000 miles, so the train will need service after the first trip.

So, the train will need service after 1 day.

A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds. 
The average of 8 and 2 is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

So, a bed for a collie takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the beds:
4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds
Total amount of stuffing needed: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is 3. 

Since a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:
4 * 3 - 5 = 7

Now, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, so the number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3 * 7 = 21.

We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. We can set up an equation to represent this:
3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + x (other reasons) = 50

Now, let's solve for x:
3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50
31 + x = 50
x = 50 - 31
x = 19

So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had before. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin scored 14 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points before. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so 3x = 14. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 3: x = 14 / 3. 

x = 4.67

So Sara had 4.67 points before. 

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we multiply Sara's points by 3: 3 * 4.67 = 14.

So Erin had 14 points before.

"To find the total cost, we need to break it down into parts.

First, we need to find the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $20 = $880.

Next, we need to add the cost of the etching for the picture frames. The etching costs 20% of the cost of each frame. 20% of $20 is 0.20 x $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching is $4 per frame. For 44 frames, it's 44 x $4 = $176.

Now, we need to add the cost of the picture frames and the etching. $880 + $176 = $1056.

Next, we need to add the cost of the pins for 2 seniors. 2 x $5 = $10.

Now, we need to find the number of officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers. 1/4 of 44 is 11. So, 11 seniors are officers.

We need to add the cost of the cords for the officers. 11 x $12 = $132.

40% of 400000 = 0.4 * 400000 = 160000

This means 160000 pieces of equipment are faulty. 

Now, we need to find the number of functioning pieces of equipment. 

Total number of equipment = 400000
Number of faulty equipment = 160000
Number of functioning equipment = Total number of equipment - Number of faulty equipment
= 400000 - 160000

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:
x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find out how many people are in the choir, we need to know that 50% of the choir are boys and 50% are girls. Since there are 52 members, that means there are 52 / 2 = 26 boys and 26 girls.

The choir decides to perform with just the female members, so they will sing with 26 girls.

Now, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13. So, 13 girls can't make it.

The choir's 3 teachers also decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people singing in the performance is 26 - 13 + 3 = 16.

"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to add up all the test scores and divide by the number of tests.

First, let's add up the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Now, let's divide the total by the number of tests: 
400 ÷ 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

"To find the total cost, I need to multiply the number of erasers by the cost of one eraser and the number of pencils by the cost of one pencil, then add them together.

6 erasers cost 6 x $2 = $12
8 pencils cost 8 x $3 = $24

Adding them together, $12 + $24 = $36

The total cost is $36."
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to first find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. 

Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

1/3 of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

Now, we add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages.

66 (messages to Ms. Thompson) + 22 (messages to Mr. Yu) = 88

The total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"So, David buys a ride bracelet for $30. That's all the rides he needs, so he doesn't need to buy any more tickets. 

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, so she needs 9 / 2 = 4.5 tickets. Since you can't buy half a ticket, she needs to buy 5 tickets. Each ticket costs $2, so she spends 5 * 2 = $10.

David spent $30 and Dasha spent $10. To find out how much David saved, we subtract Dasha's spending from David's spending: $30 - $10 = $20.

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the number of gifts she wants to make bows for.

First, let's add up the number of gifts: 
6 (for her family) + 4 (for her friends) + 2 (for her teachers) = 12 gifts

Now, let's divide the total amount of ribbon by the number of gifts:
144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"To find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have, we need to add the parts of the ratio together, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

Now, we need to divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts of the ratio (11) to find out how many popsicles each person has. 

165 ÷ 11 = 15

So, Betty has 15 popsicles and Sam has 15 * 6 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

90 - 15 = 75

The answer is 75."
"To find out how much Tim saves, we need to first calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month. 
The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 a month each, but he saves 20% when they are bundled. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the cost of the bundle is $10 - $2 = $8 a month.

Now, let's add up the cost of the streaming services: 
$10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 a month.

Since Tim used to pay $60 a month for the cable package, he saves $60 - $18 = $42 a month.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find the total work time, we need to convert all the times to the same unit. 

4 hours is equal to 240 minutes. 
Half of 240 minutes is 120 minutes. 
Adding 120 minutes to 90 minutes gives us 210 minutes. 

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total time and multiplying by 100. 

(90 minutes / 210 minutes) * 100 = 42.86%

The answer is 42.86%"
"To find out how many books Wendy needs, we first need to find out how many books can fit in the shelving system. 

Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to get the total number of spaces. 

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 spaces

Now, Wendy wants to put 20 more than double the number of books in the system. 

First, we need to find double the number of spaces. 

36 spaces * 2 = 72 books

Then, we add 20 more books to that number. 

72 books + 20 books = 92 books

So, Wendy needs 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has, we need to add the cards she made, the cards her dad brought, and the cards she received.

She made 20 cards.
Her dad brought 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so that's 2 x 15 = 30 cards.
She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's add all the cards together: 20 (made) + 30 (from dad) + 17 (received) = 67 cards.

So, Erica now has 67 Valentine's Day cards.

"To find out how many slices Jenny has left, we need to first find out how many slices she gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of 12 slices to Bill, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 slices. 
Then, she gave 1/4 of 12 slices to Mark, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 slices.

So, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices. 

Jenny had 12 slices initially and gave away 7 slices. So, she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

Jenny also ate 2 slices. So, she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark has to save his money, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has. 

$50 (initial money) - $300 (bike cost) = -$250 (shortage)

Since Mark can't save a negative amount, it means he doesn't have enough money to buy the bike. He needs more money to buy the bike.

The answer is: Mark can't buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate each type of bug separately.

First, let's find the number of millipedes. Since there are 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, we multiply the number of spiders by 1/3.

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Now, let's find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs.

Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years younger than Erica, Beth is 30 - 5 = 25 years old.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 25 + 7 = 32 years old.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 32 - 30 = 2 years.

"To find out how many calories John consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses he drank by the number of ounces in each glass and then multiply that by the number of calories per ounce.

First, we multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces in each glass: 
2 glasses * 8 ounces = 16 ounces

Then, we multiply the total ounces by the number of calories per ounce: 
16 ounces * 3 calories = 48 calories

So, John consumed 48 calories."
"To find out how much the builder earns in a month, we need to multiply the number of days he works in a month by his daily wage.

He works 4 weeks in a month, and 6 days a week. So, in a month, he works 4 x 6 = 24 days.

His daily wage is $50. So, in a month, he earns 24 x $50 = $1200.

To find out how much he earns in a year, we need to multiply his monthly earnings by 12.

$1200 x 12 = $14400.

The builder earns $14400 in a year."
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the normal recipe by 4. 
So, 3 cups of flour * 4 = 12 cups of flour. 
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

To find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs, we multiply the normal recipe by 4. 
So, 1 cup of milk * 4 = 4 cups of milk. 
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Now, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour. 
6 (bags of flour) - 2 (bottles of milk) = 4.

"To find out how much energy Mel uses per day, we need to multiply the power of the air conditioner by the number of hours it's used. 

900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (or 7.2 kilowatt-hours)

Now, if Mel reduces the time by 5 hours, he uses the AC for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

7200 watt-hours / 3 hours = 2400 watt-hours (or 2.4 kilowatt-hours) per day

To find out how much energy Mel saves per day, we need to subtract the new amount from the old amount.

7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.4 kilowatt-hours = 4.8 kilowatt-hours per day

Now, to find out how much energy Mel saves in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30.

4.8 kilowatt-hours * 30 = 144 kilowatt-hours

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up all the stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

First, let's add up the stripes:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
- A zebra with 36 stripes.
- Another zebra with half of 36, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add them all up: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 3 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The average number of stripes is 29.33."
"To find out how many muffaletta sandwiches Tyson needs to make, we need to divide the total number of people (20) by the number of people each sandwich serves (4). 

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson needs 2 pounds of meat and 2 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is 2 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $14.00
The cost of the cheese is 2 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $6.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $14.00 + $6.00 = $20.00

The final answer is: $20."
"To find the number of corns, we need to know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he bought 40 - 40 = 0 corns. 

Now, we know Allan has 40 cannolis and 0 corns. 

The total number of cannolis is 40. Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, the number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Now, we add the number of cannolis and corns: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he already took from the total steps he wants to take.

Elliott wants to take 10,000 steps.
He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
He also did 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
So, he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps so far.

Now, he has 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps left.
He only has 2,000 steps left after his jog.

So, he took 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words is 45 x 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so it will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish the book.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, so he will arrive 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. 
40 employees * $15 per hour * 40 hours = 40 * 15 * 40 = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained. 
3/4 of 40 employees = 30 employees
30 employees * $15 per hour * 40 hours = 30 * 15 * 40 = $18,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

She bought 2 pounds of taffy. Since the first pound is full price, and the second pound is half off, the total cost of the taffy is:
2 pounds * $3 = $6 (for the first pound)
1 pound * $1.5 = $1.5 (for the second pound, since it's half off)
Total cost of taffy = $6 + $1.5 = $7.5

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each. 
Total cost of seashells and magnets = $1.50 + (4 * $0.25) = $1.50 + $1 = $2.50

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets:
Total cost = $7.5 + $2.50 = $10

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $10 = $0 left.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to first find the cost of the two packages of fireworks. 

The first package costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 x $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

Since Tim got a 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $1200. 20% of $1200 is 0.20 x $1200 = $240. 

So, the total cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960. 

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. 

The total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110."
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

She eats 2 cookies a night, so in 30 days, she eats 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 cookies, we need to divide 60 cookies by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the number of candles that have the defect (5%) and also explode. 

First, we need to find the number of candles that have the defect. Since 5% of the candles have the defect, we multiply 50000 by 0.05 (which is 5% in decimal form).

50000 * 0.05 = 2500

So, 2500 candles have the defect. Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since all the candles with the defect (2500) smell like wet dog, they also explode. 

Therefore, 2500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount. 

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there's a 30% discount. 

To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage (30% = 0.3). 

$20 * 0.3 = $6

So, the discount amount for each blouse is $6. 

Now, we need to subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price. 

$20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by 4. 

$14 * 4 = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact amount is unknown.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

Since they have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 105 = 395 apples.

The final answer is: 395"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of dromedaries. 

Let's say the number of camels is C and the number of dromedaries is D. We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. 

We are given that there are 180 heads, so we can write an equation: 
C + D = 180

We are also given that there are 304 bumps, and since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can write another equation:
2C + D = 304

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the first equation to find D:
C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
200 kilometers/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers

Then, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next 2 days:
30% of 800 kilometers = 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers

So, the total distance Tom traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers

Since Tom wasn't traveling on the 7th day, we don't need to add anything to this total.

Now, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the second week:
300 kilometers/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can multiply 5 by 4 to find the size of Zack's locker.

5 * 4 = 20

So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

Now, since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply 20 by 2 to find the size of Timothy's locker.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

First, we know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, he saved 1/3 * $22 = $7.33 from the jogger jeans. This means he saved $6 - $7.33 = -$1.33 from the tattered jeans. However, since you can't save money, this is an error in the problem. We will assume that the $6 is the total savings from the tattered jeans.

Since Cole saved $6 from the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans must be $6 + $6 = $12.

Now, we know the original price of the tattered jeans is $12 and the original price of the jogger jeans is $22. 

The difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $22 - $12 = $10.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to know how much money he had before buying the ticket. 

He had $50 in spending cash and he spent $100 on the ticket. So, he must have had $100 + $50 = $150 before buying the ticket.

Since he sells his cards for $1.5 each and keeps 1/3 of them, he must have sold 2/3 of his cards. 

Let's say he started with x cards. Then, he sold 2/3 * x cards. 

Since he sold 2/3 of his cards for $1.5 each, he must have made 2/3 * x * 1.5 = $150.

Now, we can solve for x:

2/3 * x * 1.5 = 150
2 * x * 1/2 = 150
x = 150 * 2 / 1
x = 300

So, Kenny started with 300 cards.

Indras has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than that, so it's 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name. 
6 (Indras' name) + 7 (sister's name) = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items first. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00. 
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00. 
The cost of the utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we need to calculate the discount. The discount is 20% of the total cost. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

The total cost after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final answer is: $132."
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add up the cost of the items she wants to buy. 

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. 
6 + 11 + 2 = 19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has 2 + 16 = 18 dollars.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost of the items. 
19 - 18 = 1

Dora needs 1 more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. 
   Three quarters of 100 is 75, so Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. 
   Twice 75 is 150, so Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. 
   One-fifth of 150 is 30, so Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many gallons Josey needed, we need to calculate 1/4 of 15 gallons. 

1/4 of 15 gallons is 15 * 1/4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75 gallons.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3.75 gallons to pints. 

3.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 30 pints.

The answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. 

He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each. 
3 x 40 cents = 120 cents
Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, 
120 cents is equal to 1.2 dollars

George had 1% of his money left, which is 1% of 5 dollars. 
1% of 5 dollars is 0.01 x 5 = 0.05 dollars

So, George spent 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 dollars on chips and candy bars.

Now, we need to find out how much he spent on candy bars. 
Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, 
4.95 dollars is equal to 495 cents. 
495 cents is equal to 4.95 dollars

Now, we divide 495 cents by 75 cents to find out how many candy bars he bought. 
495 / 75 = 6.6

Since you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 6 candy bars.

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many lollipops each friend got, we need to subtract the number of lollipops Ray kept from the total number of lollipops he had. 

25 (total lollipops) - 5 (lollipops Ray kept) = 20

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends. 

20 (remaining lollipops) ÷ 4 (number of friends) = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

5"
"To find out how much the remaining cake weighs, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom ate from the total weight of the cake.

The cake weighs 20 ounces. 
Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they ate 2 pieces in total. 
2 pieces * 1 ounce per piece = 2 ounces

Now, subtract the weight of the two pieces from the total weight of the cake:
20 ounces - 2 ounces = 18 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces.

18"
"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to first find the total number of people, including Sitti and Juris. 

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) and 6 friends, so the total number of people is 2 + 6 = 8.

Now, we need to add the total number of oranges they have, which is 34 + 22 = 56.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

So, everyone will get 7 oranges.

7"
"To find the total cost of the onions, we need to multiply the weight of the onions by the price per pound. Antoine needs 2 pounds of onions, and they are on sale for $2.00 a pound. 

2 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $4.00

Antoine likes to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. 

4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00

Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and they are on sale for $2.00 a box. 

2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00

Now, we need to find the total cost of the ingredients. 

$8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so we need to divide the total cost by 6 to find the cost per serving. 

$12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. 

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, it takes Bernadette 4 * 4 = 16 minutes to get to the theater.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The answer is 11."
"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in 1 yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 x 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. To find the width, we can divide the area by the length: 
360 / 9 = 40 feet.

The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since the room is rectangular, it has two lengths and two widths. So, the perimeter is 2 x length + 2 x width = 2 x 9 + 2 x 40 = 18 + 80 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. 
1 pack of red beads = 1 * 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
3 packs of blue beads = 3 * 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth.
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The answer is 80."
"So, Marcus starts with a house that's 40 degrees. He bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the house will be 40 + 3 x 5 = 55 degrees.

Then, he opens the window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the house will cool down 3 times (30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3). The house will be 55 - 3 x 2 = 47 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 47 degrees.

47"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete the swim. 

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so we need to find 10% of 40 minutes. 
10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 x 40 = 4 minutes. 
So James finishes the swim 4 minutes faster than Jon, which means James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Now, let's find James' bike time. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know Jon won by 10 minutes, so we need to find James' total time. We already know James' swim time is 36 minutes and his bike time is 85 minutes. We also know Jon's run time is 50 minutes. 
Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time must be 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. 
Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 
James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to find James' run time. We know James' total time is 180 minutes and his bike time is 85 minutes. 
James' run time is 180 - 85 = 95 minutes.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then the length of Movie A.

We know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to know how far the horse runs. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, and it runs for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Now, we multiply the speed by the time to find the distance: 
32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, and it runs 16 miles, it eats 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

A bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails of hay will cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six 5-dollar bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30. 

To find out how much change he has, we subtract the cost of the hay from the money he has: 
$30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

She has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs. So, she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses. So, each tray needs 5 x 5 = 25 eggs.

To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray. 

50 eggs / 25 eggs per tray = 2 trays.

The answer is 2."
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the sneakers and the total amount of money he made from selling them.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he made 17 x $20 = $340 from those sales.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31.

He sold the remaining 31 sneakers for $25 each, so he made 31 x $25 = $775 from those sales.

The total amount of money he made is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The salesman's profit is the total amount of money he made minus the total cost of the sneakers, which is $1115 - $576 = $539.

"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's first calculate the cost of the super ticket and the regular ticket with popcorn and soda.

The super ticket costs $20 and includes a popcorn and a soda. The soda costs $3, so the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket is $20 - $3 = $17.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the regular ticket with popcorn and soda. The regular ticket costs $12, and the soda costs $3, so the cost of the popcorn in the regular ticket is $12 - $3 = $9.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the difference in cost between the super ticket and the regular ticket with popcorn and soda is $2. This difference is the cost of the popcorn in the super ticket minus the cost of the popcorn in the regular ticket, which is $17 - $9 = $8.

So, the cost of the popcorn is $8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the cost of filling 20 balloons after the price increase.

The cost of filling 20 balloons after the price increase is $900. Since the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20, we can find the original cost of filling 20 balloons by subtracting $400 from $900.

$900 - $400 = $500

This is the cost of filling 20 balloons before the price increase. To find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase, we divide $500 by 20.

$500 ÷ 20 = $25

Now, we add the $20 increase to the original cost of filling one balloon to find the new cost of filling one balloon.

$25 + $20 = $45

Now, we multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by 170 to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons.

$45 × 170 = $7650

The final answer is: 7650"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance traveled is 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The car then drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance traveled is 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, which is 150 / 3 = 50 mph.

"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we need to calculate the volume of the raised beds. 

The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised beds) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 

So, the volume of one raised bed is 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, he needs 10 * 32 cubic feet = 320 cubic feet of potting soil.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so he needs 320 / 2 = 160 bags of potting soil.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost will be 160 * $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 is 0.6 * 15 = 9

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards. 
Red cards = 15
Green cards = 24
Yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

Now, let's add up all the cards:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies."
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is 6/12 = 0.5 feet. 

There are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 x 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. The shark is 10 feet long, and the remoras are 1 foot long. 

To find the percentage, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

Now, she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. 

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to dairy, peanuts, and both from the total number of kids in the class.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts: 9 + 6 = 15

Then, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both: 15 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class: 32 - 12 = 20

So, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group and then add the number of tour guides.

There are 3 groups with 200 employees each, so 3 x 200 = 600 employees.

Each group has 7 tour guides, so 3 x 7 = 21 tour guides.

The total number of people going on the tour is 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621.

"To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 

20% of $1500 is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. 
The hotel price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total hotel cost is $1800 x 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, so the total plane ticket cost is $5000 x 2 = $10000.

The total cost of the trip is $5400 + $10000 = $16400.

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. 

They picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them. 

2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24.

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. 

Since he gave up $10 for each orange, he gave up 24 * 10 = 240 dollars.

"To find the cost of 2 packs of razors, first, we need to find the total cost of 2 packs without the discount. 

2 packs of razors cost 2 x $4.00 = $8.00

Since they are on sale, buy one get one free, so we only pay for 1 pack. 

1 pack costs $4.00

Now, we add the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. 

$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

Since we are asked to find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by 2.

$6.00 / 2 = $3.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$3.00 x 100 = 300 cents

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and each girl is 64"" tall. So, the height of this layer is 3 x 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and each girl is 64"" tall. So, the height of this layer is 2 x 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall, and she is at the top.

Now, let's add the heights of all the layers together: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

"To find the cost of the first venue, we need to add the flat fee to the cost of food. The cost of food at the first venue is $5 per guest, so the total cost is $200 + $5x, where x is the number of guests.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is $25x.

To find when the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many insects Bodhi found first. 

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, and David found 7 less than Lily, we can say that David found 7 less than Lily. 

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Then, David found x/2 insects. Since David found 7 less than Lily, we can say that Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + 7 + x/2 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

So, Bodhi found 18 insects. 

Now, we know that Lily found 7 more than David. Since David found x/2 insects, and x is 18, David found 18/2 = 9 insects. 

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"So, Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To find the total amount of yarn used, we need to add these two fractions together. 

First, we need to find a common denominator, which is 4. We can rewrite 1/2 as 2/4. Now we can add:

1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we can multiply 3/4 by 364 to find the total yards used:

3/4 * 364 = 273 yards

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half of that for a pack of green apple gum. Half of $2 is $1. So, she paid $1 for the green apple gum. 

She paid $2 for grape gum and $1 for green apple gum, so she paid $3 for the two packs of gum that weren't strawberry. 

She paid $7 in total, so the two packs of strawberry gum must have cost $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, each pack must have cost $4 / 2 = $2.

The total amount Tom paid is $48. The cost of the CD is $4. 

$48 - $4 = $44

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44. 

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the hours for each week and add them up.

Josh worked out for 4 hours every week for 6 weeks. 
6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

He also worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks. 
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

He worked out for 6 hours in one week. 
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours: 
24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours.

"Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, 48 - 8 = 40 people are left.

5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus. So, 5 x 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, there are 40 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.

At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, 80 - 21 = 59 people are left.

3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. 3 times fewer than 21 is 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get on the bus. Now, there are 59 + 7 = 66 people on the bus.

The final answer is: 66"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say James' current age is x.

In 5 years, James will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, James' cousin will be (x + 5 + 8) years old, which is x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 13 = 2x + 5

Subtracting x from both sides:

13 = x + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides:

8 = x

So, James' current age is 8 years.

Now, let's find James' cousin's current age. In 8 years, James' cousin will be x + 13 years old, which is 8 + 13 = 21 years old.

The age difference between James and his cousin is 21 - 8 = 13 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much the printer cost, we need to subtract $400 from the cost of the computer. 

$1,100 - $400 = $700

So, the printer cost $700.

Now, we need to find out how much the two monitors cost together. We know the total cost of all three items is $2,400. 

$2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

Since there are two monitors, we need to divide the cost of the two monitors by 2.

$600 / 2 = $300

So, one monitor cost $300."
"To find out how many seashells the girls brought, we need to first find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

The boys brought 60 seashells each, and there are 20 kids in total. Since they were divided into two equal groups, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 

300 / 10 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know that George had some candies, ate 5, and now has 3 left. So, before eating 5 candies, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we need to know Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

"To find the thickness of the third book, we need to subtract 5 mm from the thickness of the second book. 
The second book is 50 mm thick, so the third book is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book. The first book is 31 mm thick, so the fourth book is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thickness of all four books: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make, we need to add up the vlogs she's already made. 

She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since she needs to make 72 vlogs in total, we need to subtract the vlogs she's already made from the total. 

72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

$50 + $10 = $60.

So, you paid $60 in total."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.
2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.
3. The next day, he adds another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.
4. He spends $8, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.
5. He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

The final answer is: 39"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the total amount by 30 to find out how much he needs to save each day in the first half of the month.

$1125 ÷ 15 (half of 30) = $75 per day in the first half of the month.

Now, Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half. So, we multiply the amount he saves in the first half by 2.

$75 × 2 = $150 per day in the second half of the month.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find out how much Verna spent, we need to add up the cost of all the fruits.

Three apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50
Five oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00
Six peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50

Adding all the costs together, Verna spent $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

If she gave $20, then the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 x $0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 x $0.5 = $10.

Now, let's find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny. We subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings: $16 - $10 = $6.

Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny."
"To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to know how much Brad gets first. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

So Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

80"
"So, Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, that's 3 + 3 = 6 miles per day. He works 5 times a week, so he walks 6 * 5 = 30 miles."
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet twice, which is 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, Elise has written a total of 65 letters.

"To find out how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to calculate the number of new families contacted in each round.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are contacted.
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are contacted.
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are contacted.

So, in total, 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first find out how many toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 x 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than that, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

One geometry set costs $10

Now, let's add the costs together: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

Since the shop gives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $20.
10% of $20 is 0.10 x $20 = $2

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost: $20 - $2 = $18

Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."

"So, when the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long, which is 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we need to multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3. So, 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day, we need to multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a cold day by 3. So, 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day. So, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day. 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to know how many cups Octavia drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, we need to know how many cups Octavia drinks.

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, but we can call it x. So, Octavia drinks x/2 cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) cups. 

Juan's doctor asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. So, we can set up the equation 10 * (x/2) = 4.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get 10x = 8. Then we can divide both sides by 10 to get x = 0.8.

Now that we know Octavia drinks 0.8 cups, we can find out how many cups Juan drinks. Juan drinks 10 * (0.8) = 8 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to subtract the recommended amount from the amount he drinks. So, 8 - 4 = 4.

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures.

Peter spent $5 each on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday. There are 3 days, so he spent 3 x $5 = $15 on wooden action figures.

He has $70 initially and spent $15, so he has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. There are 3 days, so he will spend 3 x $2 = $6 on plastic action figures.

He has $55 left and spent $6, so he has $55 - $6 = $49 left.

Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he can buy $49 / $2 = 24.5 plastic action figures. But you can't buy half of an action figure, so he can buy 24 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 24 plastic action figures by the end of the week.

20 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 80 roses/month
15 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 60 roses/month
30 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 120 roses/month

Total roses ordered per month = 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses/month

Now, let's subtract the total roses supplied from the total roses ordered to find out how many roses Ford lacks.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of the bread. Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches and they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread per 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of the bread is $3.00 per loaf.

The cost of the cheese and condiments is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the cost of the cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is 10 x $7.00 = $70.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is $6.00 per 10 sandwiches, so for 10 sandwiches, the total cost is $6.00. The net profit is $70.00 - $6.00 = $64.00.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the cost of the padding is 216 x $2 = $432.

The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so the cost to remove the old carpet is 216 x $4 = $864.

The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the cost to install the new carpet is 216 x $34 = $7344.

Now, let's add up the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The total cost to replace the carpet is $10512."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by 7.

Let's add up the total number of birds:
Day 1 and 2: 50 + 50 = 100
Day 3: 0
Day 4 and 5: 120 + 120 = 240
Day 6: 20
Day 7: 90

Total number of birds: 100 + 0 + 240 + 20 + 90 = 450

Now, let's divide the total number of birds by 7:
450 ÷ 7 = 64.29

So, Mack saw an average of 64.29 birds per day.

64.29"
"To solve this problem, I'll follow the steps:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. This half value is divided by 5: 10 / 5 = 2.
4. The resulting value (2) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 2 * (20 - 12) = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final value of the number train is 16.

"So, the boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than him, which means his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards. 

To find out how many cards they have together, we need to add the number of cards the boy has and the number of cards his brother has. 

5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

They have 7 cards together.

"To find the correct temperature, we need to find the percentage that the oven is off. 

First, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 
468 - 450 = 18

Now, we need to find the percentage that the oven is off. 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the correct temperature. 
We know that the oven is 4% off, so we need to add 4% to the set temperature. 
520 + (520 * 0.04) = 520 + 20.8 = 540.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 540.8 degrees.

The final answer is: 540.8"
"To find the total time, we need to add the time of both movies. 

First, we need to convert the time of the first movie from hours and minutes to just minutes. 
1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the second movie, which is 2 hours and 5 minutes. 
2 hours is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes, and 5 minutes is already given. 
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of both movies: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

The answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract that from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of $76,000 = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the value of both houses to find the combined value.
Combined value = Herb's house value + Juan's house value
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200
Combined value = $129,200

The final answer is: 129,200"
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to know what Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.
The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will get, we need to first find out how many pairs he can get from 2 boxes. 

Since 1 box has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes, he will have 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Since each pair of contacts is 2 contacts, we divide 180 by 2 to get 90 pairs.

Now, we need to find out the cost of 2 boxes. Since each box is $100 and it's 10% off, the discount is 100 * 0.1 = $10. So, the price of 1 box is 100 - 10 = $90.

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is 90 * 2 = $180.

Now, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs to find the cost of each pair: 180 / 90 = $2.

The final answer is 2."
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their total earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 
She earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * 10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. 
He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. 
His total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 
He earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * 10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we need to subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings. 
$70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how many calories Hannah burns, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories. So, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Hannah needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's start by using the information that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. 

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since it's 1% fewer).

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

Red jelly beans = 0.99B
= 0.99 * 1500
= 1485

Now, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

Green jelly beans = 1.01B
= 1.01 * 1500
= 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1509 - 1485 = 24

The answer is 24."
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add them up and divide by 3.

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
His typing speed increased to 52 WPM after some lessons. 
Then, it increased by 5 words, so his new speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, let's add up the three measurements: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3: 156 / 3 = 52.

The average of Jared's typing speed is 52 WPM.

Alex invited 100 people, and each of them invited 2 friends. So, the number of people invited by Alex's friends is 100 * 2 = 200.

Then, Alex invited 10 of her friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses. So, the number of additional people is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the people invited by Alex, her friends, and their spouses: 100 + 200 + 18 = 318.

So, Alex needs 318 seats for the event.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of the weights given in the question.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost on both websites.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 x 2 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given. 

Let's say the smallest angle is x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees. So, we can write an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

He has 14 nickels, which is 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents.

Now, let's add all the money together: 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy: 345 ÷ 5 = 69.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find out how much Joe will have left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items he's buying.

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. So, the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate 30% of $60. 30% of $60 is 0.3 x $60 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we need to add the sales tax to the discounted price. The sales tax is 8% of $42 (assuming the sales tax rate is 8%). 8% of $42 is 0.08 x $42 = $3.36.

Now, we add the sales tax to the discounted price: $42 + $3.36 = $45.36.

Joe will have $4.64 left after the purchase."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs, we need to first find out how many croissants he wants to make. He wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. 

A week has 7 days. So, he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. 

4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days is 4 * 7 = 28 dozen croissants.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 28 dozen croissants is equal to 28 * 12 = 336 croissants.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of butter he needs to make 336 croissants. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. 

So, to make 336 croissants, he will need 336 * 1/4 pounds of butter.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator and then divide by the denominator. 

336 * 1 = 336
336 / 4 = 84

He went twice a week for 6 weeks, so he attended therapy 2 x 6 = 12 times.

Each session was 2 hours long, so he attended a total of 12 x 2 = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is 24 x 125 = $3000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day.

He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since school lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.

He starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Then, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Now, he has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find Charmaine's current age, we need to subtract 12 from 16. 
16 - 12 = 4

Now, we need to add 4 to her current age to find her age 4 years from now.
4 + 4 = 8

The answer is 8."
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is 9 x 3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is 8 x 14 = $112.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: 112 - 27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row, then multiply that by the fraction of flowers that have bloomed.

First, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row: 
10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Then, we multiply that by the fraction of flowers that have bloomed: 
200 flowers * 4/5 = 200 * 0.8 = 160 flowers

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second.

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second.

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute and 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in 1 hour.

Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour.

0.02 Mb/second x 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

The answer is 72."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. 
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days.
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by the amount he grows each year.

First, let's convert Adam's height to feet: 40 inches / 12 = 3.33 feet

Now, subtract his current height from the required height: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet

Now, divide the difference by the amount he grows each year: 0.67 feet / 2 inches = 0.67 feet / 0.17 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches) = 3.94 years

So, it will take Adam approximately 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to first find out how much he sold the cars for and then subtract the cost of the cars.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. So, the price they paid is 30% of $25,000. 

30% of $25,000 is 0.3 x $25,000 = $7,500.

So, the price James sold the cars for is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Now, James got a 10% commission on the profits. The profits are the selling price minus the cost. 

The profits are $17,500 - $7,500 = $10,000.

10% of $10,000 is 0.1 x $10,000 = $1,000.

So, James made $1,000."
"To find out how many riders can stay upright, we need to first find out how many riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. 

There are 100 riders in total. 25% of them can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. 

25% of 100 is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. 60% of them are women.

60% of 25 is 0.6 * 25 = 15 women.

To find out how many men can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10 men.

The final answer is 10."
"To find the price of the gold jewel, I need to multiply the price of the diamond by 4/5. 

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * 2000
Price of gold jewel = 1600

The price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = 1600 - 400
Price of silver jewel = 1200

Now, I need to add the prices of all three jewels to find the total price.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find out how many stamps Max bought, we need to know the number of truck stamps and rose stamps.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, let's add up the number of stamps Max bought: 
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the distance between him and Bob. 

First, we need to find out how much distance Tom needs to cover to catch up with Bob. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, Tom needs to cover 75 miles.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover 75 miles at 70 miles per hour. To do this, we divide the distance by the speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 75 miles / 70 miles per hour
Time = 1.07 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1.07 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60.

Time = 1.07 hours * 60 minutes per hour
Time = 64.2 minutes

So, it will take Tom approximately 64.2 minutes to catch up with Bob.

64.2"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the information given. 

Naomi caught 17 fish. 
Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.
Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to first find out how much he can afford to miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Manny's total cost for 10 classes is $60. If he misses some classes, the cost per class will increase. 

Let's say he misses x classes. Then, the cost per class will be $60 / (10 - x). 

We want to find the maximum value of x such that the cost per class is less than or equal to $10.

$60 / (10 - x) ≤ $10

Multiply both sides by (10 - x):

60 ≤ 10(10 - x)

Expand the right side:

60 ≤ 100 - 10x

Add 10x to both sides:

60 + 10x ≤ 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

10x ≤ 40

Divide both sides by 10:

x ≤ 4

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find out how many customers Jewel processes in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. There are 7 days in a week, so Jewel processes 50 * 7 = 350 customers per week.

Since Julie processes twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total number of customers processed per day is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

The total number of customers processed in a week is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first figure out how many miles Reggie ran. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So Reggie ran 5 x 4 = 20 miles.

Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The answer is 17."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately.

First, we find the cost of 5 apples. Since 4 apples cost $5.20, we can divide $5.20 by 4 to get the cost of 1 apple. 

$5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30

Now, we multiply the cost of 1 apple by 5 to get the cost of 5 apples.

$1.30 × 5 = $6.50

Next, we find the cost of 5 oranges. Since 3 oranges cost $3.30, we can divide $3.30 by 3 to get the cost of 1 orange.

$3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10

Now, we multiply the cost of 1 orange by 5 to get the cost of 5 oranges.

$1.10 × 5 = $5.50

Now, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together.

$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

The answer is 216."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so running boards cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to first calculate the raise and bonus.

His original salary is $20,000 per month. A 5% raise on that would be:
$20,000 x 0.05 = $1,000

So, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's add the bonus to his new monthly salary:
$21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12:
$31,000 x 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: 372,000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the suits: 
10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500

Next, let's find the cost of the dress pants: 
Since the dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit, 
1/5 * $750 = $150
10 dress pants * $150 per pant = $1,500

Now, let's find the cost of the dress shirts: 
3 shirts * $60 per shirt = $180

Now, let's add the costs together: 
$7,500 + $1,500 + $180 = $9,180

The total cost is $9,180."

"To find out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay separately.

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Since Bill has to dig through both soil and clay, we need to add the time it takes to dig through each. 
6 hours (soil) + 4 hours (clay) = 10 hours

It will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"So, on Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the price per pomegranate was 20 - 2 = 18 dollars. Then she bought 20 pomegranates, so she paid 18 * 20 = 360 dollars.

The next day, the price per pomegranate was 30 dollars. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates, so she paid 30 * 20 = 600 dollars.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is 600 - 360 = 240 dollars.

"To find the total amount Ariadne made in the first month, we need to know the sales of green hats. 

Let's say the sales of green hats in the first month is x. 
Since the sales of red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales of red hats is x/2. 
We know that the total sales of red hats is $400, so x/2 = 400. 
Solving for x, we get x = 800. 

So, the sales of green hats in the first month is $800. 
The total sales in the first month is 800 + 400 = $1200. 

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 * 1200 = $900. 
The total sales in two months is 1200 + 900 = $2100.

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find out how much James paid, we need to calculate the total hours he paid for. 

He hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he paid for 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the next two hours are 2 * $15 = $30 each.

The total cost is $15 + $30 + $30 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her weekly wage.

Weekly wage: $300
Amount in bank account: $420

$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally actually received more money than her weekly wage. To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the amount in her bank account from her weekly wage.

$300 - $420 = -$120

However, since we can't have a negative amount withheld, we need to re-evaluate the situation. It's possible that Sally received some money from somewhere else, or there might be an error in the question.

Let's try again:

$420 (amount in bank account) - $300 (weekly wage) = $120

This means Sally received $120 more than her weekly wage."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we need to divide 48 by 2.

48 / 2 = 24 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide 24 by 12.

24 / 12 = 2

The answer is 2."
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to first find out how many pages she has already written. 

She has written 1/3 of the 15-page paper. To find 1/3 of 15, we can multiply 15 by 1/3.

15 * 1/3 = 15/3 = 5

So, Shiela has written 5 pages. 

Now, we need to subtract the pages she has written from the total number of pages. 

15 - 5 = 10

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The fuel cost is twice the rent, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The total cost to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $180,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork. 

We know that it took 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the cooking time for beans is (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we need to add up the cooking times for all three foods: 30 minutes for rice, 50 minutes for pork, and 40 minutes for beans. 

30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost of the first mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

To find the cost of the second mixture, we need to calculate the cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference between the two costs.

Difference = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs and heads for each animal. 

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head. 
Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's say the number of sheep is 's' and the number of geese is 'g'. 

We know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so s + g = 20.

We also know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so 4s + 2g = 70.

We can solve these two equations to find the number of sheep. 

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40.

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get 2s = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = 15.

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find out how much everything cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee and uses 1 pound per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the coffee: 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Roger also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find out how much Gus spent on the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount he spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the items Gus bought:
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
A bottle of soda for $1.00
Total cost of other items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
$15 - $11 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To find out how many good days were left in the month, we need to first find out how many days were neutral. 

Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. We know that the first 8 days were good and the second 8 days were bad. So, the remaining days are neutral. 

The total number of days is 30. 
- 8 (good) + 8 (bad) = 16 days
- 30 (total) - 16 (good and bad) = 14 days
- 14 (neutral) 

Now, we know that the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the next 3 days were good. 
- 8 (first 8 good days) + 3 (next 3 good days) = 11 good days

So, the number of good days left in the month is 11.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to work backwards. 

Janey has 21 books, and she has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. 

Let's say Sally has x books. Then, Janey has 2x + 3 books. 

Since Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we need to subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18

Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We can do this by subtracting the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can divide the remaining inches by the daily growth rate to find the number of days: 360 ÷ 30 = 12 days.

So, the bamboo will take 12 days to reach 600 inches.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys toys for the 12 dogs, so he now has 12 toys.
4. When he comes back, there are twice as many dogs as before, so there are 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. James had 12 toys, but 3 dogs are gone, so he now needs toys for 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
6. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 21 toys in total.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money was invested by each person, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * 1200 = 480 dollars.

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find out how much is left. 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars.

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * 720 = 480 dollars.

4. Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find out how much Skyler invested. 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

So, Skyler's investment was 240 dollars.

"So, Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44. To find out how many signatures they have together, we need to add those numbers. 

20 + 44 = 64

They want to reach 100 signatures in total. To find out how many more they need, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal.

100 - 64 = 36

So, the sisters need 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns, we need to first find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 x $10 = $20 per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days. She works 3 hours per day, so in two days, she works 3 x 2 = 6 hours.

To find out how much she earns in two days, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 x 6 = $120.

The answer is 120."
"To find out how many hash browns you can make, I need to know how many hash browns one potato makes. 

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then one potato makes 36 / 6 = 6 hash browns.

The answer is 576."
"To find out how much the group of adults will exceed the maximum load, we need to calculate the total weight of the group.

There are 9 people in the group (Jack and 8 other adults). Each adult weighs 80 kg. 

Total weight of the group = 9 x 80 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. 

Excess weight = Total weight of the group - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The group will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies: 68 + 5 = 73 cookies for Max.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies: 73 - 12 = 61 cookies for the Cookie Monster.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can find Summer's cookies by adding 23 to Max's cookies: 73 + 23 = 96 cookies for Summer.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies: 
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298 cookies.

"To find the time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to add the time it took him to mow half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode.

Time in turtle mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time in rabbit mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to divide the total time by 2.

Time in turtle mode = 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes
Time in rabbit mode = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

The answer is 50."

"Let's break it down. 

We have one twin and one triplet. Let's say the age of the triplet is x. Then the age of the twin is x + 7.

The combined ages of the twin and triplet are 44. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 7) = 44.

Combine like terms: 2x + 7 = 44.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2x = 37.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 18.5.

Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 18 for the triplet. 

The twin is 18 + 7 = 25 years old.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to add up the time he has for homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert 3 hours into minutes. 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time for homework from the total time before dinner: 180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops, we need to multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10. 
10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (10/4).
$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.
$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find out how many coins Rong has, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year. 
There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years they have been saving. They have been saving for 10 years. 
So, Rong has saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per year. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. 
2/5 of 20 is 8, so Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. 
Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Now, we multiply the number of years they have been saving by the number of coins Neil saves per year. 
Neil has saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

First, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5. So, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Now, we know that oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas cost 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples cost 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges cost 7 * $3 = $21

Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The three trucks together can carry 11,600 pounds of gravel. 

To find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the amount Gissela and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total.

First, we know that 40% of the water is used by the city. Then, 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. 

To find 80% of 40%, we multiply 40% by 0.8 (since 80% is the same as 0.8). 

40% * 0.8 = 0.4

Now, we need to find what percentage 0.4 is of the total 40%. To do that, we divide 0.4 by 40% (or 0.4) and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

(0.4 / 0.4) * 100 = 100%

Now, we need to find out how many kilograms of rice that is. Since there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, we multiply the number of sacks by the weight of each sack.

7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

The answer is 175."
"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week.

She bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops this week, so that's 3 + 5 = 8 boxes.

She bought 4 boxes last week.

Now, let's subtract 4 from 8: 8 - 4 = 4.

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week.

"Helga dances for 5 minutes with her arms raised and 3 minutes with her arms down. 

In the 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps her feet at 200 taps per minute. So, in 2 minutes, she taps 2 x 200 = 400 times.

In the 3 minutes with her arms down, she taps her feet at 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. So, in 3 minutes, she taps 3 x 550 = 1650 times.

The total number of taps is 400 + 1650 = 2050.

The final answer is: 2050"
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing it.

The cost of fixing the pothole is the cost of the asphalt, which is 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75. 

The city council will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

The damage the pothole will cause to Ron's car is $450. 

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing it from the damage it will cause: $450 - $195 = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent to the carpenter from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs sent to the carpenter: 
20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs

Now, let's subtract the number of chairs sent to the carpenter from the total number of chairs:
170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 chairs
193 chairs - 33 chairs = 160 chairs

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"So, there were 5 people, and each pizza had 12 slices. 

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 2/3 of 12 slices is 8 slices. So, 3 people ate 8 slices. That's 3 x 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. ¾ of 12 slices is 9 slices. So, 2 people ate 9 slices. That's 2 x 9 = 18 slices.

In total, 24 + 18 = 42 slices were eaten. 

There were 5 pizzas, and 42 slices were eaten. So, 5 - 42 = -37 slices were left."
"To find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of 30 minutes. 

2/3 of 30 minutes is 20 minutes. 

Now, we have the time the cat takes (30 minutes) and the time the dog takes (20 minutes). 

To find the average time, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, then divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe 'x'. 

So, we can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Now, divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long."
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows for both students' and teachers' cars.

For students' cars: 
There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. 
So, the total number of windows for students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256.

For teachers' cars: 
There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. 
So, the total number of windows for teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64.

Now, Hannah smashed 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, which is 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows. 
She also smashed a quarter of the students' cars' windows, which is 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.

In total, Hannah smashed 48 + 64 = 112 windows."
"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools.

Now, let's find the number of people remaining by midday. 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people.

Next, let's find the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00. 2/3 of the remaining people voted, which is 2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people.

Now, let's find the total number of people who voted by 16:00. 2000 (voted by midday) + 2000 (voted between midday and 16:00) = 4000 people.

Finally, let's find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. 5000 - 4000 = 1000 people.

"To find out how many smores they want, we need to add the number of kids and adults. 
9 kids + 6 adults = 15 people
Each person wants 2 smores, so 15 people * 2 smores/person = 30 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we need to divide 30 smores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
30 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3.75 sleeves

Since we can't buy a fraction of a sleeve, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
So, we need 4 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide 4 sleeves by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed. 
4 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1.33 boxes

Since we can't buy a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 38 years old.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages: 
Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.

"To find out how many votes candidate B got, we need to calculate 50% of candidate A's votes. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, so 50% of the votes is 2 times 20% which is 40%. 

So, candidate B got 40% of the votes. 

Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C got. 

The total number of voters is 100. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, candidate B got 40% of the votes, and the rest of the votes was given to candidate C. 

So, candidate C got 100 - (20 + 40) = 100 - 60 = 40% of the votes.

To find out how many votes candidate C got, we need to calculate 40% of 100. 

40% of 100 is 0.4 * 100 = 40.

The answer is 40."

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so 20 kilograms will cost 20 * 3 = $60.

The answer is 60."
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to know how many books Ezra read in total. 

Ezra read 300 books initially and then read 150 more. So, Ezra read 300 + 150 = 450 books in total.

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide 450 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read. 

450 / 2 = 225

So, Ahmed read 225 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra and Ahmed read to find the total number of books they read. 

450 (Ezra) + 225 (Ahmed) = 675

The final answer is: 675"
"Let's break it down:

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so she earns 4 x $15 = $60. She also earns an additional $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns $5. In total, she earns $60 + $5 = $65 on Monday.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so she earns 2 x $15 = $30. She doesn't earn the additional $5 per day because she teaches only 2 classes. In total, she earns $30 on Wednesday.

To find the total amount Tanya earned for these two days, we add the amounts from Monday and Wednesday: $65 + $30 = $95.

The final answer is: $95"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20
Fruity scents sold: 2 * 8 = 16

Now, let's subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 - 16 = 4

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first find out how much money he made from selling eggplants. 

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 x 3 = $60 from eggplants.

Now, Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He has already made $60 from eggplants, so he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we need to divide $75 by 25. 

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find out how much time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to first find out how much time she has left after reading. 

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left on Saturday. 

On Sunday, she has 5 - 3 = 2 hours left.

Now, she spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games. On Saturday, that's 1/3 * 4 = 1.33 hours. On Sunday, that's 1/3 * 2 = 0.67 hours.

So, she spends 1.33 + 0.67 = 2 hours playing video games in total.

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer. On Saturday, that's 7 - 3 - 1.33 = 3.67 hours. On Sunday, that's 5 - 3 - 0.67 = 1.33 hours.

In total, she spends 3.67 + 1.33 = 5 hours playing soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time of the weekend and multiply by 100. 

(5 / (7 + 5)) * 100 = (5 / 12) * 100 = 41.67%

The final answer is: 41.67"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, so he gave 50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils to Brandon.
3. Now, he has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
4. He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, so he gave 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils to Charlie.
5. Now, he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time he spends driving to the museum and back.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives 75 mph. To find the time it takes to drive to the museum, we divide the distance by the speed:

Time to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since he drives back home, the time it takes to drive back is the same, 2 hours. 

Now, we add the time spent at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Time to drive to the museum + Time to drive back + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 2 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need, we need to calculate the total number of wheels for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars, Henry needs 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.
For the motorcycles, Henry needs 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

In total, Henry needs 228 wheels for the cars + 146 wheels for the motorcycles = 374 wheels.

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels Henry needs from the number of wheels he has: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

So, Henry will have 276 wheels left.

"To find the discount, I need to calculate 20% of $1000. 
20% of $1000 is 0.20 x $1000 = $200. 

Now, I need to subtract the discount from the original price. 
$1000 - $200 = $800.

So, you have to pay $800.

800"
"To find the cost, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate that as follows:

600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Now, let's find out how many movies are not in series. We subtract the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

600 - 200 = 400 movies

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate that as follows:

40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160 older movies

Now, we know that the remaining movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies.

We can calculate the cost of the movies in series as follows:

200 movies * $6 = $1200

We can calculate the cost of the older movies as follows:

160 movies * $5 = $800

We also need to add the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 240 normal movies, we can calculate the cost as follows:

240 movies * $10 = $2400

Now, we can add up the costs:

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: 4400"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

Peaches cost $2.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds, so the cost of peaches is 6 x $2.00 = $12.00.

Plums cost $1.00 per pound, and Winston picked 8 pounds, so the cost of plums is 8 x $1.00 = $8.00.

Apricots cost $3.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds, so the cost of apricots is 6 x $3.00 = $18.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the distance they drove, we need to first find their hiking speed. 

Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 
Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 
Their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

They drove for 6 hours, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

They hiked for 1.5 hours, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"To find the difference between their scores, we need to calculate their individual scores first.

Let's say Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects 3 + Ava's berries. Since Ava collects 5 points for each berry, Ava collects 5x and Emma collects 5x + 3.

Emma jumps on fewer enemies than Ava, so Emma jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Emma jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies. So, Emma doesn't get any points for jumping on enemies.

Emma finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Ava, so Emma gets 30 points for the time she has left. Ava gets 30 + 4 = 34 points for the time she has left.

Now we can set up the equation for Emma's score: E = 5x + 30

Since Emma doesn't get any points for jumping on enemies, her score only comes from collecting berries and the time left. We know that Ava collects 5x berries and Emma collects 5x + 3 berries. We also know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava gets 8 * 10 = 80 points for jumping on enemies.

Ava's score is A = 80 + 5x + 34

Now we can set up an equation to find the difference between their scores: A - E = 80 + 5x + 34 - (5x + 30)

Simplifying the equation, we get: A - E = 80 + 34 - 30
A - E = 84

The difference between their scores is 84."
"To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

64 - 30 = 34

Now, we need to divide the remaining amount by 2 since the other two pizzas cost the same amount.

34 ÷ 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the three usual days and the two extra days.

On the usual days, they ride 3 times a day, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the extra days, they ride twice the usual amount, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. There are 2 extra days, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride their bikes: 15 + 12 = 27 times.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, Bob had 3 - 17 = -14 orange fish. Since you can't have a negative number of fish, this means the sales assistant took out all the orange fish. 

Now, Bob has 4 white fish. He wants to have twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, he needs 2 * 4 = 8 orange fish.

Since the sales assistant took out all the orange fish, Bob must have bought 8 orange fish at the store.

The answer is 8."
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a week and then multiply it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 10 miles. 

So, the total miles driven per week is 5 days * 10 miles/day = 50 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses per week. We can do this by dividing the total miles driven by his fuel efficiency.

50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the gallons used by the price of gas to find the total cost.

5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to first calculate the amount of money she spent.

She was given 10 twenties, which is 10 * 20 = 200 dollars.

She spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 * 200 = 120 dollars.

She also spent all the quarters, which is 140 quarters. Since each quarter is 0.25 dollars, the total amount of money from the quarters is 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars.

Now, we add the money from the twenties and the quarters: 120 + 35 = 155 dollars.

So, Carrie paid 155 dollars for lunch.

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the difference in temperature between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's 12 degrees colder at night, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, he needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs to heat the house up to the desired temperature.

"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group had.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The answer is 12."

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to first find the number of students who passed in each grade.

Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed, which is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.

Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed, which is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.

Fifth-graders: Their pass rate is twice the fourth graders', so it's 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 or 80%.

Now, let's add up the total number of students and the total number of students who passed:

Total students: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000
Total passed: 340 + 40 + 320 (2 * 160, since 400 / 5 = 80, and 80 * 2 = 160) = 700

Now, let's calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total passed / Total students) * 100

= 70%

The school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to first find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with two bags of glass chips.

Since each bag holds 72 chips and it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide 72 by 12 to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag.

72 ÷ 12 = 6 square inches

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches he can make with one bag by 2.

6 square inches * 2 = 12 square inches

Now, we know that Milo can make 12 square inches of mosaic with two bags of glass chips. Since he wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we need to find out how many inches long it will be.

To do this, we divide the total square inches by the height of the mosaic.

12 square inches ÷ 3 inches = 4 inches

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many quarts of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to add up the quarts of tea that the students drank and add that to the quarts of tea left.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.
Adding those together, 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, we need to add the quarts of tea left to the quarts of tea that the students drank. 38 quarts (drunk) + 10 quarts (left) = 48 quarts.

- At the end of May, the number of students is 160 * 2 = 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the number of additional students, we subtract 10 from 320.

320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find out how many branches he climbed in total. 

Felix made $105 in a week. There are 7 days in a week. 

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Now, we need to divide the total number of branches by 7 to find out how many branches he climbed per day.

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
3 flowers * 5 petals = 15 petals

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
4 flowers * 6 petals = 24 petals

Then, let's calculate the total number of petals for the 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
5 flowers * 4 petals = 20 petals

Lastly, let's calculate the total number of petals for the 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
6 flowers * 7 petals = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals:
15 petals + 24 petals + 20 petals + 42 petals = 101 petals

However, Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, so we need to subtract 1 from the total number of petals for each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: 15 - 1 = 14 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: 24 - 1 = 23 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: 20 - 1 = 19 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: 42 - 1 = 41 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals again:
14 petals + 23 petals + 19 petals + 41 petals = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows. 

First, let's find out how many marshmallows were used. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows.

Now, let's subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows. 35 - 18 = 17

They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so we need to subtract those too. 17 - 3 = 14

Now we know there are 14 marshmallows left. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make 14 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores by 2. 14 / 2 = 7

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores."
"So, let's break it down. 

Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. His friends can play for half that time, which is 10 minutes. The better friend can play for 1.5 times that, which is 15 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time they played. 
Jack played for 20 minutes, his friend played for 10 minutes, and the better friend played for 15 minutes. 
20 + 10 + 15 = 45 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 45 minutes is 45/60 = 0.75 hours.

Since they played for 0.75 hours, and each quarter is 0.25 hours, we need to divide 0.75 by 0.25 to find out how many quarters were used. 
0.75 / 0.25 = 3 quarters.

So, 3 quarters were used.

The answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the amount of salt used is x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also x ounces.

Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces.

Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of citrus zest is also x ounces.

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of salt, sugar, oil, citrus zest, and fragrance. Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, we can say that the amount of fragrance is also x ounces.

So, the total amount of the mixture is x + x + 2x + x + x = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 6x = 10

Divide both sides by 6: x = 10/6

x = 5/3

Now that we know the amount of salt, we can find the amount of oil. Since the amount of oil is 2x, the amount of oil is 2 * (5/3) = 10/3 ounces.

10/3"
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent $4500 at the market.

4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes.
He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. 
So, he has 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, let's subtract 48 from 63:
63 - 48 = 15

Paul needs 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we need to calculate 20% of 40. 20% is the same as 0.2, so we multiply 40 by 0.2. 40 x 0.2 = 8. Joe sells 8 cars.

Now, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 x 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from his total. Joe had 40 cars initially, sold 8, and gave away 16. 40 - 8 - 16 = 16. Joe has 16 cars left."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount raised by the charity. 

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000 (from students)

Now, we need to divide the amount from students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 ÷ 20 students = $6,250 per student

The answer is 6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to first find the time she walked on the second day. 

She walked 8 hours on the first day. 
She walked half as many hours on the second day, so she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

Now, we need to add the time she walked on both days. 
8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 12 hours to minutes. 
12 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of cars in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for lunch break. 
   Initially, there were 50 cars. Then, 20 more cars came in, so the total number of cars is 50 + 20 = 70.

2. Then, 1/2 of the total number of cars left the parking lot. 
   1/2 of 70 is 70 / 2 = 35.

3. To find the number of cars that were left in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars.
   70 - 35 = 35.

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to first find out how much he makes in a day. 

He does 30 cycles a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. So, he does 30 x 5 = 150 tasks a day. 

Each task pays $1.20, so he makes 150 x $1.20 = $180 a day.

If he works 7 days a week, he makes $180 x 7 = $1260 in a week.

1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we know she scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Now, let's add up the points Sasha scored in both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many tins of cat food and dog food Kimberly bought, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of tins in each package.

Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Now, we need to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought. To do that, we subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins.

88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"Let's break it down step by step.

Let's say PJ has x cards. 
Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

The final answer is: 153"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and then subtract the refund amount from the original purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost for weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
- The book needs to be returned 20 miles, so the shipping cost for miles is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
- The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
- The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of that, so the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24

Now, let's calculate how much Milly will lose:
- The total cost of shipping is $3.00
- The refund amount is $24
- The amount Milly will lose is $3.00 - $24 = -$21

Milly will lose $21."
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to first add the money she had and the money her father gave her. 

Mulan had $40 and her father gave her $100. 
$40 + $100 = $140

Then, she bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 x $30 = $60. 
$140 - $60 = $80

She also bought a bag for $20. 
$80 - $20 = $60

So, Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to know how much he produced in the first three weeks.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the chocolate produced in the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can subtract the amount produced in the first three weeks from the total to find out how much he produces in the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The answer is 14,000."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok, we need to calculate the total time she spends on it each week and then multiply it by 4.

She records 18 videos a week, so that's 18 * 4 minutes = 72 minutes per week.

She spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes per week.

She spends 15 minutes a day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week.

Now, let's add up the time she spends on TikTok each week: 72 minutes (recording) + 120 minutes (writing songs) + 90 minutes (doing makeup) = 282 minutes per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1128 / 60 = 18.8 hours.

So, Britany spends 18.8 hours on TikTok in a month."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the items that Angela needs installed, and the cost of the items that are already included in the initial package.

The initial package includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier. Angela needs 6 mirrors, so she needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors. The cost of the additional mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

The initial package also includes 10 pictures, but Angela needs 20 pictures. So, she needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures. The cost of the additional pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

The initial package also includes 1 chandelier, but Angela needs 2 chandeliers. So, she needs 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier. The cost of the additional chandelier is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $150.00 + $15.00 = $195.00.

The initial package costs $129.00. The total cost for Angela is $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first find out how much money Anthony has. 

Eva has $20.00 and Anthony has $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Roy has 40% more money than Anthony. 40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. So, Roy has $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain. 

Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 inches.

Now, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can. Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12. So, Naruto can lift 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to add the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can divide 18 hours by 3 to find the time it would take for 1 kangaroo to travel across the highway.

18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo

Now, we know that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of a turtle is 1/2 * 6 hours = 3 hours.

Since there are 4 turtles, we can multiply the time it takes for 1 turtle to travel across the highway by 4.

3 hours * 4 turtles = 12 hours

Now, let's add the money she already has in her purse, the money she got from her job, and the money her mom gave her:
Let's call the amount of money she has in her purse 'x'. 
We know that she needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has is $400 + $50 = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation to find 'x': 
x + $150 + $80 = $450

Combine the constants: 
x + $230 = $450

Now, subtract $230 from both sides: 
x = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse.

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to add the money he already has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. 
So, the total money he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Now, let's subtract the money he has from the total cost:
$10800 - $5200 = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600.

The change Thea got is $10."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to first calculate how much he spent.

Craig buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so he spends 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so he spends 3 x $3 = $9.

In total, Craig spends $12 + $9 = $21.

Craig started with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is $40. So, he has $40 - $21 = $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many socks Peter and Jack have.

We know Jack collected 60 dishes and that's twice as many as socks. So, to find out how many socks Jack has, we divide 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Jack has 30 socks.

We also know Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, to find out how many socks Peter has, we multiply 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60

Now, we know Peter has 60 socks.

We also know Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, to find out how many dishes Peter has, we divide 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Peter has 30 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes.

30 (Peter's socks) + 60 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

First, let's add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only: 5 + 8 = 13

Now, subtract this number from the total number of students: 20 - 13 = 7

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

The number of students good at math is 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12.

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time taken by each group and subtract that from the total time of the concert.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time taken by each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. 

Now, let's subtract the time taken by each group from the total time of the concert: 
120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we need to divide the remaining time by the time taken by each group to find out how many groups can perform:

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

For the first year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 1 year is $300 + $225 = $525.

For the second year, the interest earned is 3/4 * $525 = $393.75, so the total amount after 2 years is $525 + $393.75 = $918.75.

For the third year, the interest earned is 3/4 * $918.75 = $693.5625, so the total amount after 3 years is $918.75 + $693.5625 = $1612.3125.

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1612.3125.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many white shirts have no collars and how many floral shirts have no buttons.

Half of the white shirts have collars, so the other half don't have collars. 
There are 40 white shirts, so half of them is 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with no collars.

There are 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. 
The difference between 30 (floral shirts with no buttons) and 20 (white shirts with no collars) is 30 - 20 = 10.

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to first find out how many goats were sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats, so he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's subtract the number of goats sold from each farm:
Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

Now, let's add the number of goats left in each farm:
45 + 25 = 70

So, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

"To find out how much James pays for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year by the number of pairs he buys.

First, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs a month, and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 2 pairs by 12 months.

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year ($2640) by the number of pairs he buys in a year (24 pairs).

$2640 ÷ 24 pairs = $110 per pair

The answer is 110."

3 baskets of red food will cost 3 x $16 = $48.

Now, I need to add the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food. 
$75 + $48 = $123.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of our ages is 87.

Let's use variables to represent the ages:
- Let B be my brother's age.
- Let S be my sister's age.
- Let I be my age.

From the first statement, I = B - 3.
From the second statement, S = I + 2.
From the third statement, Mom's age = 3B - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so I + S + Mom's age = 87.
Substituting the expressions for I, S, and Mom's age, we get:
(B - 3) + (B + 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine like terms:
5B - 2 = 87
Add 2 to both sides:
5B = 89
Divide by 5:
B = 17.8

Since B must be a whole number (you can't be a fraction of a year old), this is a problem. However, let's continue with the calculation to see if we can find a whole number solution.

Now that we know B, we can find I and S:
I = B - 3 = 17.8 - 3 = 14.8
S = I + 2 = 14.8 + 2 = 16.8

However, since I and S must be whole numbers, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the equation 5B = 89. Since B must be a whole number, we can try different values of B to find a solution.

If B = 18, then I = 15, and S = 17. Let's check if the sum of our ages is 87:
I + S + Mom's age = 15 + 17 + (3*18 - 1) = 15 + 17 + 53 = 85

If B = 19, then I = 16, and S = 18. Let's check if the sum of our ages is 87:
I + S + Mom's age = 16 + 18 + (3*19 - 1) = 16 + 18 + 56 = 90

If B = 18, we are close to 87, but if B = 19, we exceed 87. Let's try B = 18.5, but since B must be a whole number, this is not possible.

However, if we re-examine the equation 5B = 89, we can try B = 17.8, but since B must be a whole number, this is not possible.

Let's re-examine the equation 5B = 89. Since B must be a whole number, we can try B = 17.8 is not possible, but we can try B = 17.9, but since B must be a whole number, this is not possible.

However, if we re-examine the equation 5B = 89, we can try B = 17.8 is not possible, but we can try B = 17.9 is not possible, but we can try B = 18.

If B = 18, then I = 15, and S = 17. Let's check if the sum of our ages is 87:
I + S + Mom's age = 15 + 17 + (3*18 - 1) = 15 + 17 + 53 = 85

If B = 18, we are close to 87, but if B = 18, we are 2 years short of 87. Let's try B = 18 + 1 = 19.

If B = 19, then I = 16, and S = 18. Let's check if the sum of our ages is 87:
I + S + Mom's age = 16 + 18 + (3*19 - 1) = 16 + 18 + 56 = 90

If B = 19, we exceed 87.

"To find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we need to multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student gets. 

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 to find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy.

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to buy 7 packs to have enough glue sticks for all the students. This will also give him some extra glue sticks.

7 packs * 8 glue sticks/pack = 56 glue sticks

He will have 2 extra glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"So, the river had 4000 gallons of water at first. Then it doubled, so it had 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons. On the third day, it increased by 6000 gallons, so it had 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day.

Day 1: 10 people are infected initially.
Day 2: 10 people infect 6 others each, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected. Total infected = 10 + 60 = 70.
Day 3: 70 people infect 6 others each, so 70 * 6 = 420 new people are infected. Total infected = 70 + 420 = 490.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer had left, we need to subtract the number of oranges she gave to her daughters and the boy from the total number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son, so that's 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number of oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

So, Jennifer had 3 oranges left.

"Let's break it down step by step:

Claire earns 1 badge per month. In a year, she earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So, Amber earns 1/2 badge per month. In a year, she earns 12/2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So, Wendy earns 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 3 x 12 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"So, Paige baked 2 loaves of banana bread every hour for 5 hours. That's 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. 

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she has 10 * 8 = 80 slices. 

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so she sold 80 slices for 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars."
"To find out how many silver coins Gretchen had, we need to subtract 30 from the number of gold coins. 

So, 70 (gold coins) - 30 (more gold coins than silver) = 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we need to add the number of gold coins and silver coins. 

70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110 coins.

The total number of coins Gretchen had is 110."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. 
50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Then, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 
500 burritos - 20 burritos = 480 burritos

So, there were 480 burritos leftover from the picnic.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.
3. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so they have 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars.
4. The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.
5. The rink has 75 cars in total, so the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Fawn has x books. 
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that together they have 85 books, so we can write the equation:
x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will get. 

30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide 120 cups by 10 cups per box to find out how many boxes Greg needs.

120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the price per box to find out how much Greg will spend.

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the price of each phone: 
5 phones * $700 = $3500

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, that means Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x $400 = $160. 

Now, we need to divide $160 by 4 to find out how much Keenan spends per week. 

$160 ÷ 4 = $40.

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. 
He ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. 
2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total number of pieces.
60 - 24 = 36 pieces left.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. 
36 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

Now, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the third day. 
He ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. 
7/13 * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the third day from the remaining pieces.
26 - 14 = 12 pieces left.

So, Tobias ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces in total.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. David wants to buy 16 bolts, so the total cost will be 16 x $0.03 = $0.48.

Now, we need to subtract the total cost from the money David has. 

David has $12.48 and spends $0.48 on bolts. 

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts.

For multiple-choice questions: 
There are 10 questions, and she answers 80% of them correctly. 
80% of 10 is 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
There are 20 questions, and she answers 90% of them correctly. 
90% of 20 is 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
There are 5 questions, and she answers 60% of them correctly. 
60% of 5 is 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions answered correctly. 
Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Isaias is selling 180 chickens at $50 each. 

The total money he will make from selling 180 chickens is 180 * 50 = $9000.

Since Isaias wants to make $2000, we need to subtract $2000 from $9000 to find out how much he spent on the chickens.

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

So, Isaias spent $7000 on the chickens he took to the market for sale."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

So, Julie sold 3.33 more glasses than Micah.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to know the speed of the thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of whatchamacallit = 121 meters per second
Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. 

Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, we can say that x * 6 = 6. 

Solving for x, we get x = 1. 

So, she mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, Kamala's lawn 3 times, and Alba's lawn 5 times. 

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 times. 

Since she made $6 per mowing, she made 9 * 6 = $54 from mowing lawns.

3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total amount John gets paid, we need to multiply the number of hours he rents his car per month by the number of times he rents it, and then multiply that by the hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. So, the total hours per month is 10 x 3 = 30 hours.

He gets paid $25 per hour, so the total amount he gets paid per month is 30 x $25 = $750.

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from the total amount he gets paid. His car payment is $500, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can divide 7 by 3 to find out how many notebooks Joseph had.

7 ÷ 3 = 2.33 (round down to 2 since you can't have a fraction of a notebook)

Now, Martha bought 5 more notebooks. So, she now has 7 + 5 = 12 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

12 - 2 = 10

Joseph has 10 fewer notebooks than Martha."
"To find the distance Anis rowed, we need to calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance and add it to Dijana's distance. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 10 miles.

The answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to first find out how many pages Daniel read yesterday and today.

Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages.

Now, we need to find out how many pages Daniel read today. Since he didn't read any pages today, he read 0 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read. 

Denise read 18 pages, and Daniel read 0 pages. 18 - 0 = 18.

Denise read 18 more pages than Daniel.

"To find out how many bowls of soup Calvin has, we need to know how many bowls he has in total. Since he can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say he has 8 child's bowls. 

Now, let's calculate how many bowls are left after everyone eats one bowl for dinner. Calvin, his wife, and two children will eat 3 bowls. So, 8 - 3 = 5 bowls are left.

Now, we need to find out how many times 5 bowls can be divided by 2 (since there are 2 children). 5 ÷ 2 = 2.5. Since you can't have half a bowl, each child can have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"To find out how much William spent, we need to add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately.

For small masks: 
She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
To make 20 small masks, she would need 20 / 4 = 5 yards of material.

For large masks: 
She can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. 
To make 8 large masks, she would need 8 / 3 = 2.67 yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks: 
5 yards (small) + 2.67 yards (large) = 7.67 yards of material.

The final answer is: 7.67"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the number of tickets. 

Deepa has seen 9 movies, and she has seen each one 3 times. So, she has bought 9 x 3 = 27 tickets.

The total amount spent is $216. 

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the number of tickets: 
$216 ÷ 27 = $8

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to calculate the total hours in a day. There are 24 hours in a day.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the hours he sleeps, works, and walks his dog from the total hours in a day: 
24 - 10 - 8 - 1 = 5

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

He gave 1/5 of 30 marbles to Jamie. 1/5 of 30 is 6. 

So, Dean gave away 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles. 

Now, we need to subtract the marbles Dean gave away from the total number of marbles he had. 

30 - 16 = 14

Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know Duncan's current age is 60. We also know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Let's denote Adam's current age as 'A'. 

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was 60 - 8 = 52. Four years ago, Adam's age was A - 4.

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can set up the equation:

52 = 2 * (A - 4)

Now, let's solve for A:

52 = 2A - 8
52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A
A = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
30 + 8 = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
So, twice that is 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 
100 acres more than that is 400 + 100 = 500 acres. 

Now we have the size of both farms: 
Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. 

To find the total number of acres, we add them together: 
200 + 500 = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes in an hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, so he earns 320 * 0.20 = $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to first find out how long it takes him to solve the sudoku puzzle. 

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. 
So, an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. 
180 / 30 = 6

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he will drink 6 bottles of water in 180 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons.

Since Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we can subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons to find the number thrown at the yellow balloons. 

First, let's find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons: 
20 red balloons * 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon = 40 pieces of bologna

Now, let's subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces thrown:
58 - 40 = 18

Since 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons, and each yellow balloon got 3 pieces of bologna, we can divide 18 by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons:
18 / 3 = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days.

Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 / 1000 = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total, we need to calculate the hours he works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 5 * 2 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, they bought 12 balloons. Each balloon costs $0.5, so 12 balloons cost 12 * 0.5 = $6. 

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so that's 2 * 7 = $14.

The total amount they spent is 11 + 6 + 14 = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount they spent by 2 to find out how much their mother gave each of them. 

$31 / 2 = $15.5.

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. 
6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 16 (soccer) + 22 (girls) + 16 (boys) = 72

There are 72 students in total."
"To find the total amount of money the class raised, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold and then multiply it by the profit per lollipop.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300 lollipops.

The profit per lollipop is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

Now, we multiply the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: 300 * $0.3 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from selling lollipops.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils. 
So, Larry has 3 cats, 9 dogs, 7 rabbits, 21 fish, and 7 gerbils.

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups in total. She divides these into 3 rows. So, 27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, that means there are 9 cups of each type in each row. 

The remaining cups are used for cinnamon tea, which is 15 cups. Since there are 3 rows, 15 cups / 3 rows = 5 cups per row for cinnamon tea.

Now, we know that each row has 9 cups of tea in total. Since 5 cups are for cinnamon tea, the remaining 4 cups must be for mint tea. 

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby had 4 boxes of candy, so that's 4 x $2 = $8. He also had 2 tubs of popcorn, so that's 2 x $8 = $16. 

He spent $8 on popcorn and $2 on candy, so that's $8 + $2 = $10. 

He started with $150, so he has $150 - $10 = $140 left.

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he's already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, so he's spent 5 x $10 = $50. 

He has $140 - $50 = $90 left.

Now, he can buy tickets for $90 / $7 = 12.86. Since you can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 12 tickets.

Let's say Peter's age is P, Paul's age is P + 10, and Jean's age is P - 10 (since Paul is 10 years older than Jean).

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. So, we can write the equation:

P + (P + 10) + (P - 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

3P = 100

Divide both sides by 3:

P = 33.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean must be 33, 43, and 23 respectively.

For the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9
For the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20
For the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, let's add the amounts together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake. 
60% of 20 miles is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

So, James swims 12 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour. 
Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. 
Half of 6 hours is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles at half the speed. 
Half of 2 miles per hour is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Time taken to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour = 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

Total time taken = 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming) = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first find out how many loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. 
Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 
The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had. 
So, we need to multiply 70 by 7 and then subtract 40. 
7 * 70 = 490 
490 - 40 = 450 

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to do some math. 

First, let's start with the stickers she had initially: 15. Then, she lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

After that, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then add them together.

Commission from the New York Times:
6 copies * $5 * 10% = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3

Commission from the Wall Street Journal:
10 copies * $15 * 8% = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Total commission:
$3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find Leo's age, we need to know Deanna's age and the relationship between Marcus and Leo. 

We know Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

We also know Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, Leo's age is 2 times Marcus's age. Leo's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to know how many points Dinar scored. 

Let's say Dinar scored x points. 
Since Azibo scored 10 more points than Dinar, Azibo scored x + 10 points. 
Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored (x + 10) + 20 points. 

We know that the total points is 45. So, we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 10) + (x + 10 + 20) = 45

Combine like terms: 
3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides: 
3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 5/3 

Since x is the points Dinar scored, Dinar scored 5/3 points. 
Azibo scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Azibo scored 5/3 + 10 points. 

To add 10 to 5/3, we need to convert 10 to a fraction with the same denominator. 
10 = 30/3 

Now we can add: 
5/3 + 30/3 = 35/3 

So, Azibo scored 35/3 points."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch.

The book is 1.5 inches thick, and each paper is 2 pages thick (one on each side). 

So, we multiply 1.5 inches by 2 pages per inch. 

1.5 * 2 = 3

There are 3 pages in the book.

"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports. 

First, we need to find out how many hours he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by 15 minutes to find out how many 15-minute intervals:

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 30:

60 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

1800"
"To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep. 

First, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, she woke up at 5:55 p.m. (10 p.m. - 5 minutes).

Now, let's calculate the time she was asleep. She went to sleep at 2:15 a.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m. 

To find the total time she was asleep, we need to subtract the start time from the end time. 

5:55 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 3 hours 40 minutes

Now, we need to add the 8 hours she usually sleeps. 

3 hours 40 minutes + 8 hours = 11 hours 40 minutes

So, she slept for 11 hours and 40 minutes on her bed that day.

11 hours 40 minutes"
"To find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons he had initially. 

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has 2 dozen cups, which is 2 x 12 = 24 cups. 

So, he has 2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

Then, he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. 

So, he has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so he has a total of 24 + 10 = 34 utensils.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 beds = 100 beds

So, there are 100 occupied beds.

Now, we need to find the number of unoccupied beds. 

The hospital has 1000 beds and 100 are occupied, so the number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 100 = 900 beds.

Now, we need to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days. 

In 14 days, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. 

So, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we need to subtract the number of patients admitted from the number of unoccupied beds to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 900 - 700 = 200 beds.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many emails are not work emails. 
   Total emails sent per day = 16
   Work emails = 7
   Emails not work emails = Total emails - Work emails
   Emails not work emails = 16 - 7
   Emails not work emails = 9

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these emails are to family.
   Emails to family = 2/3 of the emails not work emails
   Emails to family = (2/3) * 9
   Emails to family = 6

3. Now, we need to find out how many emails are to her boyfriend.
   Emails to boyfriend = Emails not work emails - Emails to family
   Emails to boyfriend = 9 - 6
   Emails to boyfriend = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find Shawna's age, we need to know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the correct number of people, we need to calculate 20% of 48 and subtract it from 48.

20% of 48 is 0.20 x 48 = 9.6

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many balls Jeffrey picked up. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan must have carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

So, the coach brought 7 balls to practice.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day. So, the total number of holes on the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.

Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

87"
"So, Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each. Since they got an equal amount, that means they got 70 + 70 = 140 corn chips together.

Now, let's say the number of corn chips the other person got is x. Since that person got 15 more corn chips than the others, that person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

We know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips Amora, Lainey, and the other person got. So, the total number of corn chips is 140 + 85 = 225.

The answer is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the supplies cost and add it to the supplies cost.

50% of $400 is 0.5 x $400 = $200.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon.

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon.

We know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught 4x - 13 + 5 Pokémon.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:

x + 4x + 4x - 13 - 13 + 5 = 339

Combine like terms again:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2. 
Total minutes per episode = 20

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction.

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 10
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 * 2
Distance = 36 miles

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 * 5
Distance = 110 miles

Now, we need to add the distances traveled in each direction to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.
Total Distance = 300 + 36 + 110
Total Distance = 446 miles

"To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

She started with 1 dozen brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies.

Then, she got 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies she received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day.

25% of 8 is 0.25 x 8 = 2. 
Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all three family members: 
Nani's age + Nani's brother's age + Nani's sister's age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30.

The total age of all three family members is 30."

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is the distance around the garden. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Number of slats = Perimeter * 2
Number of slats = 50 * 2
Number of slats = 100

The answer is 100."
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had left, we need to calculate the total number of oranges she had initially and then subtract the ones she gave away and kept.

She bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

Now, let's subtract the ones she gave away and kept from the total number of oranges: 240 - 80 - 60 = 100 oranges.

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges.

$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Tyler has $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we need to divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage.

$25 ÷ $5 = 5

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to know how many Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can subtract 10 from 30 to find out how many Richard has.

So Richard has 20 cherries. 

Now, we can subtract the number of cherries Richard has from the total number of cherries to find out how many Jerry has. 

60 - 20 = 40

Jerry has 40 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has.

30 - 40 = -10

Since you can't have a negative number of cherries, this means Robert has fewer cherries than Jerry."
"Let's break down the information given:

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 6 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $90

Total earnings for Saturday: $60

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Emil's dad's current age is 'x' and his brother's current age is 'y'.

Since Emil is 19 years old now, we can write an equation for Emil's age in the future: 
19 + (24 - 19) = 24 (Emil's age when he turns 24)

This equation is true, so we can move on to the next part of the problem.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. We can write an equation for this:
24 = (x + (24 - 19)) / 2

Simplifying the equation:
24 = (x + 5) / 2
48 = x + 5
x = 43

Now that we know Emil's dad's current age, we can find his brother's current age. When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. We can write an equation for this:
24 = 2y
y = 12

Now that we know both Emil's dad's and brother's current ages, we can find the sum of their ages:
43 + 12 = 55

On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so he caught 3 * 4 = 12 pounds of crawfish. 
On Saturday, he caught half of Friday's amount, so he caught 12 / 2 = 6 pounds of crawfish. 
Now, let's add up all the crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds. 
Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we need to divide 21 by 3 to get the number of servings.

Now, we add the sizes of both boots: 5 (Sophie's) + 25 (Charlie's) = 30.

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 30 / 2 = 15.

The average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to convert 1.5 feet to inches as well. 1.5 feet is equal to 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches.

Now, we can calculate the total space needed for the plants and the space between them. Each plant takes up 12 inches, and there's 18 inches of space between each plant. So, the total space needed for one plant and its space is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total space available (1332 inches) by the space needed for one plant and its space (30 inches). 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 * 6 = $162.

"To find out how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias. She wants 3 petunias in each basket, and there are 5 baskets. So, she needs 3 x 5 = 15 petunias. Each petunia costs $3.00, so the total cost of the petunias is 15 x $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines. She wants 2 vines in each basket, and there are 5 baskets. So, she needs 2 x 5 = 10 vines. Each vine costs $2.50, so the total cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 x $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines together. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."

They planted 4 sunflowers, which need 3 pounds each, so that's 4 x 3 = 12 pounds. 
They planted 10 carnations, which need 1.5 pounds each, so that's 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds. 
The total used is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds. 

They have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left. 

Since each rose needs 1 pound, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000 is 0.25 x $2,000 = $500.

Since she sets aside $500 each month, in a year (12 months), she sets aside $500 x 12 = $6,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside ($6,000) by the cost of each pair of shoes ($1,000) to find out how many shoes she can buy in a year.

"To find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how long it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

She can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 30 shrimp, it will take her 30 / 6 = 5 minutes.

She can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to saute 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

So, it will take her 5 minutes to peel and 30 minutes to saute, which is 35 minutes in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours. So, it cooled the room 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours. So, it cooled the room 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.

In total, the air conditioner cooled the room 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. So, in the 2 hours that the air conditioner was off, the room warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The final temperature is the starting temperature minus the total cooling and plus the total warming. However, we don't know the starting temperature. Let's call it x.

The final temperature is x - 18 + 4 = x - 14.

Since we don't know the starting temperature, we can't find the exact final temperature. However, we can say that the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to know how old his dad was when he saw the comet. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since then. 

Let's say the number of years that have passed is x. Then, the number of years that will pass until the comet orbits again is also x. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can set up the following equation:

30 + x = 3(30 + x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 + x = 90 + 3x

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

30 = 90 + 2x

Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get:

-60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

-30 = x

Since we can't have a negative number of years, this means that the comet hasn't orbited for 30 years. 

So, Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and 30 years have passed since then. 

Therefore, Bill was 30 - 30 = 0 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year.

1. He writes 1 check per month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
2. He writes 1 check per month for the gas bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
3. He writes 2 checks per month for the church, so that's 2 x 12 = 24 checks per year.
4. He writes 1 check every 3 months for the pest and lawn service, so that's 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

The second plane makes 44 trips, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece for 88 * 3/4 = 66 trips.

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is 88 - 66 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to first find the length of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we need to add the lengths of all three howls together. 
20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60. 
120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first find out how much money Adam's parents gave him in total.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, so his father gave him 2 x $6 = $12.

In total, Adam's parents gave him $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30, so he had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.
3. Let's add the ages of Akbar and Alessandro: 3 + 4 = 7
4. Since the total age of the children is 20, we subtract the sum of Akbar and Alessandro's ages from the total age: 20 - 7 = 13
5. This 13 is the combined age of Helene and Wilfred.
6. We know Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Since there are 4 children, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5. 
7. Since Helene is twice the average age, Helene is 2 * 5 = 10 years old.
8. Now, we subtract Helene's age from the combined age of Helene and Wilfred: 13 - 10 = 3
9. This 3 is the age of Wilfred.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first find out how much money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute to make the total amount three times of $2000.

Let's say Walter's lawyer is going to contribute x. Then, the total amount will be $2000 + x. We know that this amount should be three times the amount Walter has collected so far, which is $2000. So, we can set up the equation:

$2000 + x = 3 * $2000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$2000 + x = $6000

Subtracting $2000 from both sides, we get:

x = $4000

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $4000.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate half of 100 guests. 
100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies. 
Half of 1500 cookies is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies. 

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. 
To find out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 
750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people.

The answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's say each kid gets x slices. Then, each adult gets 2x slices.

Since there are 4 kids, the total number of slices for the kids is 4x. And since there are 2 adults, the total number of slices for the adults is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total number of slices is 4x + 4x = 8x.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets 2x slices, and the total number of slices is 8x. To find the percentage, we divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

(2x / 8x) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his tasks.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Total time spent on tasks: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the time spent on tasks from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

First, we add the time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Then, we add the time to bake the cake: 20 + 30 = 50 minutes
Next, we add the time to cool the cake: 50 + 120 minutes = 170 minutes
Finally, we add the time to frost the cake: 170 + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract 3 hours from the serving time to find the latest start time. 
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Cost of the students: 10 students, $1.50 per student per session, 3 days a week, for a month is 10 * 1.50 * 3 * 4 = $180.

Total earnings: $300 (renting) + $180 (students) = $480.

The total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars each person has by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so we divide 64 by 4 to get 16 chocolate bars per box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so we divide 56 by 7 to get 8 chocolate bars per box.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box Martha has from the number of chocolate bars per box Peter has: 16 - 8 = 8.

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Now, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in 1 cubic foot. 

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10480 gallons

The pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. 

Total gallons needed = 10480 * 5.9
Total gallons needed = 61932 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. 

Cost = Total gallons needed * cost per gallon
Cost = 61932 * 0.10
Cost = 6193.20

The cost to fill the pool is $6193.20."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to know the number of blue sticks first. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks by adding 5 to 9.

Blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14

Now, we know the number of blue sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so we can calculate the number of yellow sticks by subtracting 3 from 14.

Yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = 11

Now, we have the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks. To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together.

Total sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The total number of sticks is 34."

"To find the number of female students, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. 
1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 are male. 
1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

Now, we know the number of male students over 16 and under 16 years old. 
375 + 750 = 1125 male students.

To find the total number of female students, we subtract the number of male students from the total number of students.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. So, the total amount of water in the tank after the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. So, the total amount of water in the tank after the second day is 7875 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts.

First, let's say the initial charge of the power bank was x.

Since the power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours, the charge remaining after 5 hours would be:

x - (9% of x) * 5
x - 0.09x * 5
x - 0.45x
0.55x

Now, for the next 3 hours, the power bank was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, the charge remaining after 3 hours would be:

0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3
0.55x - 0.07 * 0.55x * 3
0.55x - 0.1025x
0.4475x

The charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.4475x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4475:

x = 0.28 / 0.4475
x = 0.628

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 62.8%."
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of $10,000.

Now, let's calculate how much Janet makes in a week. She makes $10 an hour and works 40 hours a week, so she makes $10 x 40 = $400 per week.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we need to divide $2,000 by $400.

$2,000 ÷ $400 = 5 weeks.

So, Janet needs to work 5 weeks to save the down payment.

He bought 2 kiwis for $1 each, so that's 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples for $.75 each, so that's 5 x $.75 = $3.75

Adding all the money spent on other fruits, we get $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy any plums.

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out how many pieces of sweets she gave away. 

Anne kept 2 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, she kept 2 x 60 = 120 pieces.

She gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, she gave away 13 x 60 = 780 pieces.

Now, she gave 780 pieces to 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide 780 by 10.

"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

This means she put 9 pictures in each album. 

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies and 2 albums were portraits. Since each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply the number of albums by 9 to find the total number of pictures in the portraits and selfies.

3 (selfies) * 9 = 27
2 (portraits) * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

So, James read 6 sets of 3 pages. 

Since each set takes 10 minutes, we multiply 6 by 10. 

6 * 10 = 60

James spent 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests who checked in, we need to calculate the number of people who checked in twice as many as those who opted for a late checkout.

Then, 7 more people checked in after dinner. 

So, the total number of guests who checked in is 30 + 7 = 37.

Now, we need to subtract the number of guests who checked out. 24 guests checked out early and 15 checked out late. 

So, the total number of guests who checked out is 24 + 15 = 39.

Now, we subtract the number of guests who checked out from the number of guests who checked in. 

The hotel initially had 100 guests.

60% of 60 questions is 0.6 * 60 = 36 questions. 
Since they are equally divided, we divide 36 by 2 to get 18 average and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 18 easy questions and half of the average and difficult questions, which is 9 questions each.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the price of a small stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold 'y' large stuffed animals. Then, she sold 2y small stuffed animals.

The total amount she earned from the sales is $120. We can set up an equation to represent this:

(Price of a large stuffed animal) * (Number of large stuffed animals) + (Price of a small stuffed animal) * (Number of small stuffed animals) = Total amount earned
3x * y + 4x * 2y = 120

Combine like terms:
3xy + 8xy = 120
11xy = 120

Now, we know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. So, the price of a small stuffed animal (x) is $4. We can substitute this value into the equation:
11 * 4y = 120
44y = 120

Now, divide both sides by 44:
y = 120 / 44
y = 2.73 (round down to 2, since you can't sell a fraction of a stuffed animal)

So, Teresa sold 2 large stuffed animals and 2 * 2 = 4 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 
Then, he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 
Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 
To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 by 40, which is 1440 pounds.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month, we multiply 1440 by 30, which is 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package to find the total price: $1.50 * 8 = $12.

The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first find out how much he still owes for the bedroom set after selling his old one.

Tom bought the bedroom set for $3000 and sold his old one for $1000. So, he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Now, he has to pay 10% of $2000 per month. To find 10% of $2000, we multiply $2000 by 0.10.

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   25 red balloons * 40% = 25 * 0.4 = 10 red balloons burst.

2. Calculate the remaining red balloons:
   25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. Calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released:
   12 yellow balloons * 0.5 = 6 yellow balloons were released.

4. Calculate the remaining yellow balloons:
   12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

5. Calculate the number of blue balloons Sally found:
   8 blue balloons.

6. Calculate the number of blue balloons she added to her clutch:
   8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

7. Calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:
   15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to calculate the probability of the opposite event (not having to turn in homework) and subtract it from 100%.

The chance that Marcus won't have to turn in homework is the sum of the probabilities of the following events:
- The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 100% - 40% = 60%
- The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 40% (this is the opposite of the event we're looking for, so we'll subtract it from 100%)
- The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect homework: 100% - 50% = 50%

Now, we add these probabilities together: 60% + 40% + 50% = 150%

However, we can't have a 150% chance, so we need to subtract the total from 100% to find the chance that Marcus won't have to turn in homework: 100% - 150% = -50%. But since we can't have a negative chance, we need to re-evaluate our approach.

Let's try a different way. We can find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in homework by adding the probabilities of the events where he won't have to turn in homework and subtracting that from 100%:

- The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 40%
- The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect homework: 50%

Now, we add these probabilities together: 40% + 50% = 90%

Now, we subtract this from 100% to find the chance that Marcus will have to turn in homework: 100% - 90% = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of seats taken by graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many large beans Grandpa can eat, then how many medium beans, and finally how many small beans.

First, we know that 75 large beans fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, he can eat 2 x 75 = 150 medium beans.

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to multiply the number of medium beans by 3.

150 medium beans x 3 = 450 small beans.

The answer is 450."
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total expenses and total earnings.

Total expenses: 
- Parking: $3 per day * 3 days = $9
- Daily earnings: $15 per day * 3 days = $45
- Total earnings: $45
- Total expenses: $9
- Net earnings: $45 - $9 = $36

Now, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total. 
Total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours

Now, we can calculate her hourly wage after expenses:
$36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour

"To find out how much Ted spent, we need to add the cost of the books and pencils.

The cost of the books is 3 x 16 dollars = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 x 6 dollars = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent 66 dollars in total."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the space between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. He has 2 boxes of apples, and each box has 40 apples. So, he has 2 x 40 = 80 apples.

Now, he wants to pack the apples in packs of 8. To find out how many packs he can make, we need to divide the total number of apples by 8.

80 ÷ 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 11 * 2 = $22.

Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of mozzarella cheese is 6 * 3 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the initial amount: $50 - $40 = $10.

"So, Jim had a $25,000 a year job before college. He went to college for 4 years, so he didn't work for 4 years. That means he lost $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

He got $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, so he got $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Now, he got a job that tripled his income, so his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how long it would take him to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working, we need to add the money he lost and the money he got from the loans. That's $100,000 + $200,000 = $300,000.

Now, we need to divide the total amount by his new income to find out how many years it would take him to earn that amount. $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

The answer is 4."
"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the comforter first. 

The comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the comforter's dimensions are:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we multiply the length and width to get the area:
8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday, we need to calculate one-fifth of Monday's delivery and add 17.

One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85
Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102

Now, we need to calculate twice Tuesday's delivery and add 5.

Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204
Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209

Now, let's add Monday's, Tuesday's, and Wednesday's delivery to find the total.

"So, Johnny lost $5 on the first race. 
He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, which is 2 * $5 + $1 = $11. 
He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, which is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50. 
So, he lost $5 + $16.50 = $21.50 in total. 

To find the average, we need to divide the total amount he lost by the number of races, which is 3. 
$21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

There are 26 countries in South America.
Each country has 5 cities with 1000 people in each city.

First, multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country: 
26 countries * 5 cities = 130 cities

"So, Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is 48 inches. He grew 3 inches, so now he's 48 + 3 = 51 inches tall.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so now he's 50 + 2 = 52 inches tall.

To find the difference between their heights, we need to subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height. 52 - 51 = 1.

"To find the share of the first person, we need to first find out how much money each person took.

Let's say the first person took x dollars.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + 80 dollars.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80) dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

The final answer is: 576.67"
"To find the total hours of work, we need to first find the total hours worked by the team. 

There are 24 hours in a day. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day, that's 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours per day.

They worked for 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

So, the total hours worked by the team is 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter. 

189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter.

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is x.

In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x/2 balls.

We know that the total number of balls he retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls Rory retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 2007: The car is worth $20,000.
Year 2008: The car depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is $4,200. So, the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
Year 2009: The car depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is $3,306.80. So, the car is worth $15,800 - $3,306.80 = $12,493.20.
Year 2010: The car depreciates by 21% of $12,493.20, which is $2,616.928. So, the car is worth $12,493.20 - $2,616.928 = $9,876.272.

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.27.

"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visit. The doctor charges $300/hour for 30 minutes, so we need to convert 30 minutes to hours. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

Cost of visit = $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150

Now, let's add the cost of the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

Cost of cast = $200
Cost of painkillers = $4/pill * 30 pills = $120
Cost of parking = $6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total cost = Cost of visit + Cost of cast + Cost of painkillers + Cost of parking

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.

So, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left, and Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85 left.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to know how many bananas the first two monkeys eat in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas a day.

The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so the first two monkeys eat 24 * 7 = 168 bananas in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, so the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a day, we divide 147 by 7. 
147 / 7 = 21.

The third monkey eats 21 bananas a day."
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to first find out how many pieces he finished in total. 

He finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, so that's 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, in total, he finished 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The answer is 750."
"To find out how much Jenny spent on roses, we need to know how many roses she bought. She bought 15 roses. Roses cost $2 each, so she spent 15 x $2 = $30.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is 5 x $5 = $25. She spent $30, so she needs $30 - $25 = $5 more. Since they only have quarters for change, she needs 4 quarters to make $5.

The answer is 4."
"To find out how much money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total amount from each item and add them together.

"To find out how long Paul will wait, we need to calculate the time between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves the station at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long Paul will wait for his train. Paul will wait until the fourth train arrives, which is 145 minutes."
"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12). 

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we need to divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80"
"To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we need to divide 2000 by 0.75 to get the original price. 

Original price = 2000 / 0.75 = 2666.67

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. 

Selling price = 1.2 * 2666.67 = 3200

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

Discount = (Original price - Selling price) / Original price * 100
= (2666.67 - 3200) / 2666.67 * 100
= -533.33 / 2666.67 * 100
= -0.20 * 100
= -20%

The negative sign means the friend got a discount, but we are only interested in the percentage, so we take the absolute value.

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is 20%."
"So, if every second a spring creates a new jellyfish, that means one spring creates one jellyfish per second. 

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, they would create 5 jellyfish per second. 

There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 4 hours in the given time. 

So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is 60 * 60 * 4 = 1440 seconds.

Now, if 5 springs create 5 jellyfish per second, they would create 5 * 1440 = 7200 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 7200"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first find twice Binkie's score. 
Twice Binkie's score is 2 x 90 = 180.

Frankie's score is 195."
"To find the time it took James to reach the store, we need to first find the total distance he walked. 

He walked 4 miles to the store and then 4 miles back home, so the total distance is 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Since he walks 4 miles per hour, we can divide the total distance by his speed to find the time it took him to reach the store.

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

The answer is 2."
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to first find out how much she would have paid if she bought the bananas individually. 

She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she bought 10 x 4 = 40 bananas. Each banana costs $0.80, so she would have paid 40 x $0.80 = $32.00.

Now, she bought 10 bunches for $3.00 each. So, she paid 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Then, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence. 

Since they have 100 feet of fence in total, we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 
2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 
2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: 
x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

Now, let's find out how much is left over for Sam. 
Total fence = 100 feet
Fence given to Sam = 20 feet
Fence left over for Sam = 100 - 20 = 80 feet

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Half of them were Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes
- 15% of them were BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes
- The rest were MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 MTB bikes * $500 = $52,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 BMX bikes * $250 (half of $500) = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 Trekking bikes * $450 = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: 131,250"
"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. So, in one hour, the farmer makes 5 bales and the truck picks up 3 bales. That means 5 - 3 = 2 bales are left in the field per hour.

If they work for 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales, and the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales. So, the total number of bales picked up is 30 + 18 = 48 bales.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the total number of bales picked up from the total number of bales made. 30 - 48 = -18. This means the farmer and the truck picked up more bales than they made."
"To find out how many minutes John spends in class, we need to multiply the number of classes by the class duration and the number of days he attends classes.

6 classes * 40 minutes = 240 minutes
240 minutes * 5 days = 1200 minutes

Now, we need to add the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. 
1/16 of 7 days is 7/16, so we multiply 1200 minutes by 7/16.
(1200 * 7) / 16 = 1050 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total minutes to hours.
1050 minutes / 60 = 17.5 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The ball is initially dropped from the third floor, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet high.

On the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its initial height, so it goes up to 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce, so it goes up to 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to follow the given information:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. 
   Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. 
   So, the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. 
   So, the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.

"To find out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, and that's half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the T-Rex ate half of the original amount, which means the Allosaurus ate the other half.

Let's call the original amount of meat ""x"". Since the Allosaurus ate half of it, that means the T-Rex ate the other half, which is also x/2.

We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, which is half of the original amount. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 270 * 2
x = 540

So, there were 540 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each one is 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. There are two of them, so the total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each one is 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. There are two of them, so the total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add the total area of all the walls together: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The paint costs $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to first find out how many shaken sodas are left.

Ellen shook 3 sodas, but then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself. So, there are 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas left.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, so there are 2 - 1 = 1 shaken soda left.

Now, Ellen's friend came along and took 2 unshaken sodas. So, there are 1 shaken soda left and 0 unshaken sodas left.

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 1/1 = 1.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 1 * 100 = 100%.

"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them.

"To find out how many days Billy is available, we need to subtract the days he's not available from the total days in March.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, so we need to find 20% of 31.

20% of 31 is 0.2 x 31 = 6.2. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

Now, we subtract the days he's not available from the total days in March: 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 x 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he's available by the number of people he can help per day: 25 x 6 = 150.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 15-minute breaks per day. 
First, we need to convert the breaks into minutes. 
2 breaks * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Now, we add the lunch time and the breaks: 
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes into hours by dividing by 60:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

So, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 1 hour per day.

"To find the new balance on her credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought after the discounts.

First, let's calculate the discount on the frying pan:
Original price: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the discount on the towels:
Original price: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought:
Frying pan: $16.00
Towels: $27.00
Total cost: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card and returned $15.00, so the new balance before the new purchases is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Now, let's add the total cost of the new items to the new balance:

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. This means that 1/3 of the large jellyfish are blue. Since the other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, we can assume that the small jellyfish are also blue.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish is x. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5, since a fifth of the jellyfish are large.

We know that 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

We are also told that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary. 

20% of $100,000 is 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

Since Lauren lives with 40% of her current salary, she spends 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Lauren saves $20,000 per year. To find out how much she needs to save in total for 20 years, we multiply her annual savings by 20.

$20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

Now, we need to find out how much Lauren earns per year. Since she lives with 40% of her salary, she earns 100% - 40% = 60% of her salary. 

60% of $100,000 is 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000 per year.

To find out how many years it will take Lauren to save $400,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual income.

$400,000 / $60,000 = 6.67 years.

Lauren needs to work for approximately 6.67 years to save enough for her retirement."

"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial number of each type of fish and the number of new ones Tate bought.

For male fishes: 
- Initial male guppies: 4
- Initial male goldfishes: 3
- New male guppies: 2
- New male goldfishes: 2
Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Total male fishes: 6 + 5 = 11

For female fishes: 
- Initial female guppies: 7
- Initial female goldfishes: 5
- New female guppies: 1
- New female goldfishes: 3
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8
Total female fishes: 8 + 8 = 16

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes.
Difference: 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

"To find out how long it took Megan to walk the dog, we need to add 2 hours to Amalia's time. 
Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours
Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours
Megan's time = 6 hours

To find out how long it took Dior to do laundry, we need to add 4 hours to Amalia's time.
Dior's time = Amalia's time + 4 hours
Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours
Dior's time = 8 hours

Now, we need to add up the time for all three of them to do their chores.
Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance first. 

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we multiply the distance by 2. 

140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we multiply the total round trip distance by 2.

280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how far Brian will walk, we need to know how far Sofie will walk. Since Sofie walks 10 miles a day, in 7 days she will walk 10 * 7 = 70 miles.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we need to divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

70 / 2 = 35

Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys the first 4 workers produce in 10 hours.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so they produce 2 x 6 = 12 toys per hour. 
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so they produce 2 x 4 = 8 toys per hour.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, we can find out how many toys the fifth worker produces in 10 hours. 
The first 4 workers produce 20 toys per hour, so in 10 hours they produce 20 x 10 = 200 toys.

The fifth worker produces 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide 180 by 10, which is 18 toys per hour.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog to find the total weight.
15 + 30 + 60 = 105 pounds.

The answer is 105."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.
2. Since Kris got half of the stickers from Luis, and Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
3. Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, and Kris got 16 stickers. So, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers initially.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Luis had 32 stickers. So, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers initially.

"To find out how many M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The answer is 90."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the way around the earth, we need to divide the distance of half the earth by the distance Alfie flies per day.

Half the way around the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we divide 20,000 by 400 (the distance Alfie flies per day).

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly half the way around the earth.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Since it's 5 times faster than the average car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.
   Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph

2. Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
   Speed of faster car = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph

The faster car goes 750 mph."
"To find Vince's age, we need to know Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

Now, Vince is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted x eggs. Then, Camden painted x + 12 eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:

2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Since the total number of eggs is 56, and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, Arnold and Madeline must have painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same number of eggs, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. So, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To find the total weight, we need to first find out how many boxes Nik can fill with crayons. 

Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons. 
200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so 25 boxes will weigh 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to convert the weight of the boxes from ounces to pounds. 
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 12.5 pounds."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log. 

80 feet / 4 feet per log = 20 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5.

20 logs * 5 planks per log = 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

100 planks * $1.2 per plank = $120

The answer is: $120"
"So, Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice as much as her, so he earns 2 x $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Now, let's add their salaries together: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 x $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add their salaries together: $15,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $45,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the sidewalk. 

First, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach and 40 minutes is spent on the beach. 

To find the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach, we can divide 40 minutes by 2 miles. 

40 minutes / 2 miles = 20 minutes per mile

Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. 

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. 

20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per mile on the sidewalk

Now, we know it takes 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. 

Now, we can add the time it takes to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time it takes to complete the entire 3-mile walk. 

20 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 30 minutes

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first find out how much she has already saved. 

She saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4 x 8 = $32.

Now, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save. 
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we need to divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings.
$28 ÷ $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has now. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is 24. So, if he has 60 marbles after receiving 24 more, he must have 60 - 24 = 36 marbles before receiving the 24 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's first find out how much water Donny has in the second mug. 

He has 2 mugs of water, and one mug is 33 degrees. Let's say the second mug is x degrees. 

He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug. So, the total amount of water he has now is 4 + 1 = 5 ounces.

Since he can drink the water now, the total temperature of the water must be at least 40 degrees. 

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. The total amount of water is 5 ounces, and the total temperature is 40 degrees. We can set up an equation:

(4 * 33) + (1 * x) = 40

We know that 4 * 33 is 132. So, the equation becomes:

132 + x = 40

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 40 - 132
x = -92

Since the temperature can't be negative, this means the second mug must be at least 40 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens first.

Initially, there were 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Melkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day for three weeks. 
There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days.
20 cows per day for 21 days is 20 x 21 = 420 cows.

Now, let's add the cows to the initial number of cows: 
50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day for three weeks. 
10 chickens per day for 21 days is 10 x 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the chickens to the initial number of chickens: 
20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of the bagels, first, we need to find the total number of bagels. 

There are 9 bagels in a pack and Russell ordered 4 packs. 
9 bagels/pack * 4 packs = 36 bagels

The total cost of the bagels without the discount is 36 bagels * $10.00 = $360.00

Russell gets a 10% discount. 
10% of $360.00 is 0.1 * $360.00 = $36.00

The total cost after the discount is $360.00 - $36.00 = $324.00

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels. 
$324.00 / 36 bagels = $9.00 per bagel

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 6 - 3 = 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We know that 3 scoops of mashed potatoes require 6 potatoes. 

So, 18 scoops of mashed potatoes will require 18 / 3 = 6 potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 6 potatoes.

"To find out how many eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days. 
90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide 240 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs.
240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)

"To find the number of women on the bus, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14.

We know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of one part. 

84 ÷ 14 = 6

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts for women, which is 9.

9 * 6 = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus initially. 

Now, 20 women alight from the bus, so we subtract 20 from 54.

He earned $56 from the bouquet per day, and he did this for 3 days. So, he earned 3 x $56 = $168 from the bouquets. 

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can divide $168 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold. $168 / $8 = 21 bouquets.

Now, we know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so we multiply 21 bouquets by 12 sunflowers. 21 x 12 = 252 sunflowers.

Faraday sold 252 sunflowers."

"To find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people, we need to calculate 100% of their daily energy demand. 

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand (20% / 20% = 1, and 1 * 5 = 5).

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many days it will take to produce 11500 bottles. 

11500 / 4200 = 2.74 days.

Since we can't produce a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, it will take 3 days to produce enough bottles.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce in 3 days. 

4200 * 3 = 12600 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce in 3 days from the total number of bottles needed.

1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, so that's 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wearing both purple and bows.

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. We know 2 babies are wearing both purple and bows, and 1/3 of the blue wearers also wear bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are wearing blue, that's 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies wearing blue. So, 1/3 * 2 = 2/3 of the blue wearers are wearing bows. 

The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (both purple and bows) + 2/3 * 2 (blue and bows) = 2 + 4/3 = 10/3.

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. That's 2 (babies wearing both purple and bows) / 10/3 (total babies wearing bows) = 6/10 = 3/5 = 60%.

13 - 10 = 3.

Geb is 3 years old.

"Let's break it down step by step:

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by all of them: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the amount he gets paid per apartment.

First, let's find out how many apartments are in the last complex. Since it's 60% bigger than the other two combined, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

Now, let's find 60% of 400 apartments. 60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240 apartments.

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we know that John collects garbage from 3 complexes, and he collects 3 times a week. So, the total number of apartments he collects garbage from in a week is 3 * 3 * (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 * 3 * 1040 = 9840 apartments.

John gets paid $0.40 per apartment, so he makes 9840 * 0.40 = $3912 per week.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, but we don't know the amount produced by a 10-year-old tree yet. We'll come back to this later.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces. We know that it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, which produces 1000 fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total amount of fruits produced by the tree during its 10 years of life:

- 5-year-old tree: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old tree: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old tree: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old tree: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old tree: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old tree: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: 2350"

"Let's break it down step by step. 

We know the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. Let's call the length of the yellow rope 'y'. Then the blue rope is y - 7 centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is 4 * (y - 7) centimeters.

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write the equation: y + (y - 7) + 4 * (y - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37.

Combine like terms again: 6y - 35 = 37.

Add 35 to both sides: 6y = 72.

Divide both sides by 6: y = 12.

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope: y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope: 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given. 

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5. So, Rissa was given 3 x 5 = $15.

Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, so she gave 15 / 2 = $7.50 to her sister.

Now, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. 4/5 of 15 is 4/5 x 15 = 12.

So, Rissa has 15 - 7.50 = $7.50 left.

The question asks how much is left in Ronnie's money. Since Ronnie didn't give any money to her sister, he still has the $5 he was given.

The final answer is 5."
"To find out how many pints of red paint were used, we need to know that half the mural is yellow, so the other half must be the other three colors. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the total amount of paint used by 3 to find out how many pints of each color were used in the half that is not yellow.

12 pints / 3 = 4 pints per color

Since half the mural is yellow, we need to multiply the amount of paint used for the other half by 2.

4 pints * 2 = 8 pints

So, 8 pints of red paint were used.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom:
Area of one bedroom = length * width
Area of one bedroom = 20 * 12
Area of one bedroom = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
Total area of bedrooms = 4 * 240
Total area of bedrooms = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:
Area of living room = 5 * 240
Area of living room = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together:
Total area of the house = Total area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of the rest of the house
Total area of the house = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area of the house = 3160 square feet

On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts 12 * 2 = 24 puffs.

On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts 24 * 2 = 48 puffs.

Now, let's add up all the puffs of clouds she counted across the five days:

"To find out how many cycles you can run, we need to first find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.20 * 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

You want to know how many cycles you can run for $1. You spend $12 for 100 pods. So, for $1, you can buy 1/12 of the pods. 

1/12 of 120 pods is 120 / 12 = 10 pods. 

So, you can run 10 cycles with the new box for $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he has 50 bills initially.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

He uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how many days he has left, we need to divide the remaining chalk by 20% (or 0.2). 

2.75 / 0.2 = 13.75 days.

Since you can't have a fraction of a day, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 14 days."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity.

There are 12 girls and one-third of them are on varsity. 
One-third of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4 girls on varsity.

So, the total number of students on varsity is 3 boys + 4 girls = 7 students.

Now, we need to find the number of students not on varsity. 
There are 12 boys and 12 girls, so the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24.

"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we need to first calculate the total cost of the milk he purchased.

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. 

Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5 per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * 3.5
Total cost = 14000

Now, Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. To find out how many gallons that is, we need to multiply 4000 by 2/5.

2/5 of 4000 = (2/5) * 4000
= (2 * 4000) / 5
= 8000 / 5
= 1600

So, Mr. Marcellus returned 1600 gallons of milk.

The cost of the returned milk = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 in refunds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Wendy's current age is W and Colin's current age is C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This means that Wendy's current age is 5 times Colin's age 7 years from now. So, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This means that Colin's age 25 years from now is 1/3 of Wendy's current age. We can write an equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, substitute W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, subtract 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

Now, we need to divide the total number of sets by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Since each set has 100 books, we multiply the number of sets per school by 100.

3. He picked up the 1 apple from the tree, put it in his pocket, and threw 5 more apples out of the tree, so now he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground.
4. He picked up all the apples on the ground (5) and put 1 in his pocket, leaving 4 apples on the ground.
5. He picked up the remaining 4 apples and threw 6 more apples out of the tree, so now he has 4 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. 
To find out how many slices of each pizza Kate needs, we divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices in each pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since you can't buy half a pizza, Kate needs to buy 8 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay can build in a certain amount of time, considering the ones that melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. Since 2 melt every 15 minutes, in 60 minutes (1 hour), 4 snowballs will melt (2 * 2 = 4).

So, Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 4 melt. This means he has 20 - 4 = 16 snowballs left after an hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Jay to build 44 more snowballs (60 - 16 = 44). Since he builds 20 snowballs in an hour, it will take him 2 hours to build 44 snowballs.

However, we need to consider the melting of snowballs. In 2 hours, 8 snowballs will melt (2 * 4 = 8). So, after 2 hours, Jay will have 44 - 8 = 36 snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take Jay to build 24 more snowballs (36 - 12 = 24). Since he builds 20 snowballs in an hour, it will take him 1.2 hours (24 / 20 = 1.2) to build 24 snowballs.

Now, we need to add the time it took to build 44 snowballs (2 hours) and the time it took to build 24 snowballs (1.2 hours). So, the total time is 2 + 1.2 = 3.2 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 3.2 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to know how old John was when Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim back then, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Jim's age at that time was x. Then John's age was 2x. We know that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + (number of years since then) = 28

We don't know the exact number of years since then, but we can find it by subtracting John's age at that time from his current age. Since John is 28 now, we can find his age at that time by subtracting the number of years since then from 28.

Let's call the number of years since then 'y'. Then John's age at that time was 28 - y. We know that John's age at that time was 2x, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 28 - y

We also know that John's age at that time was twice Jim's age, so we can set up another equation:

2x = x + y

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

x - y = 28 - y - y
x - y = 28 - 2y
x = 28 - y

Now we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation:

2(28 - y) = x + y
56 - 2y = x + y
56 - 2y = x + y
56 - 2y - y = x
56 - 3y = x

Now we can substitute this expression for x into the first equation:

2(56 - 3y) = 28 - y
112 - 6y = 28 - y
112 - 6y - 28 + y = 28 - y + y
84 - 5y = 28
84 - 28 = 5y
56 = 5y
y = 56 / 5
y = 11.2

Now that we know the number of years since then, we can find Jim's age at that time by subtracting y from John's age at that time:

Jim's age at that time = 28 - 11.2
Jim's age at that time = 16.8

Since Jim's age at that time was x, we can set up the equation:

x = 16.8

Now we can find Jim's current age by adding the number of years since then to Jim's age at that time:

Jim's current age = x + y
Jim's current age = 16.8 + 11.2
Jim's current age = 28

However, this doesn't make sense, since Jim's age at that time was 16.8, and now he's 28. This means that the number of years since then is actually 28 - 16.8 = 11.2. But we already know that y = 11.2, so this is a contradiction.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that John is 28 now, and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out. We can set up the equation:

John's current age = 2 * Jim's current age

We know John's current age, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2 * Jim's current age
Jim's current age = 28 / 2
Jim's current age = 14

The answer is 14."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of bandages they started with is x.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 pack of 50, so they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered 2 packs of 50, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, they had x + 84 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation x + 59 = 78.

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides of the equation: x = 78 - 59.

x = 19.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. 50% of $60 is $30. So the cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. He bought 10 bottles of scotch, so he bought 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles x $90 per bottle = $1800.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, so he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60 trees.
The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

"So, let's break it down step by step. 

Fred started with 24 gallons of root beer. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons. 

Then, his wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons. 

After that, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons. 

Now, 3 people are going to share the remaining root beer. To find out how much each person will get, we need to divide the remaining 8 gallons by 3. 

8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 gallons per person.

The answer is 2.67."
"To solve this problem, I need to follow the steps:

1. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is x.
2. ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" means 4 times the number of coffee mugs plus 8. So, it can be written as 4x + 8.
3. The problem states that this is equal to 40. So, we can write the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.
4. To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8, which is 4x = 32.
5. Now, divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 32 / 4, which is x = 8.

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to find one-third of 66. 

66 / 3 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the remaining fish. 

66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 

44 * 5/11 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Now, we need to add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 

22 + 20 = 42

The final answer is 42."
"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of colors she had initially and then subtract the colors she used.

Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 x 4 = 8 colors. 

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 x 6 = 18 colors.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister stole one palette with 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 colors. 

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. So, she used 6 / 2 = 3 colors.

Now, let's subtract the colors she lost and used: 26 - 4 - 3 = 19.

Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we find the height of the first floor. Since it's thrice as high as Mattison, we multiply 60 by 3. 
   60 * 3 = 180 inches

2. Now, we find the height of the house. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, we multiply 60 by 7.
   60 * 7 = 420 inches

3. To find the height of the roof, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.
   420 - 180 = 240 inches

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To find out how many shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 
40% of 700 is 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found 280 shells. 
700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. 
60% of 420 is 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

"To find out how much John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of his house's value. 

40% of $250,000 is 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000.

Now, John uses 60% of that to pay off his debts. 60% of $100,000 is 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000.

To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total amount he got from the loan. 

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

The answer is 40,000."
"So Deandre caught 3 tunas, and the first one weighs 56 kilograms, the second one weighs 46 kilograms, and the last one weighs 26 kilograms. To find the total weight of the tunas, I need to add them together: 
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the price she sells the magazines for. 

She bought the magazines for $72 and sells them at 11/8 of that price. 

11/8 of $72 is (11/8) * 72 = 11 * 9 = 99

So, Trinity sells the magazines for $99. 

Her profit is the selling price minus the buying price: 
$99 - $72 = $27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, let's add the water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters.

"To find the capacity of John's school, we need to find the capacity of one of his classes. Since each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we multiply the capacity of Ali's class by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * 1/8 = 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15 = 30

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities. 

Combined capacity = 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150

"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. 

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. So, the interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 x $300 = $6.

The total amount Stephen owes is $300 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in 11 months is $25 x 11 = $275.

Now, to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

So, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to know how many diapers are changed in total per day. 

Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 x 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, that means Jordan also changes half of the diapers. 

So, Jordan changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar first. 

The volume of a rectangular prism (the jar) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 

Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15
Volume = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency in packing, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total jelly beans = Volume / 0.8
Total jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Total jelly beans = 675

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 675 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 202.5

However, the problem states that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to subtract the actual number of red jelly beans from the estimated number of red jelly beans.

Difference = Estimated number of red jelly beans - Actual number of red jelly beans
Difference = 202.5 - 900
Difference = -697.5

Since the difference is negative, it means Tim's guess was too low."
"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to follow the steps:

1. The bus had 20 people initially.
2. 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, so the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of passengers doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the number of people on the bus from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"So, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. That means she visits 3 times a year * 5 years = 15 times in the first 5 years. 

The cost of one visit is $2. So, she spent 15 * $2 = $30 in the first 5 years.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. That means the new cost is $2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $3.

She visited the museum for 3 more years, so she visited 3 times a year * 3 years = 9 times. 

The cost of one visit is now $3. So, she spent 9 * $3 = $27 in the last 3 years.

In total, Pauline spent $30 + $27 = $57 on all visits to the museum.

"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5. 

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can represent the length of the shorter piece as x. Then, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms: 5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece: 4x = 4 * 8 = 32 feet

So, the longer piece is 32 feet.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 5 x 2 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

"To find out how many books each shelf can hold, we need to know how many books the bottom shelf can hold. 

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. Since the middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. So, the top shelf can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, we know that the bottom shelf can hold 20 books, the middle shelf can hold 10 books, and the top shelf can hold 15 books. 

Let's add up the books that the bottom, middle, and top shelves can hold: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books.

Elly has 110 books, so she needs more shelves. Since the bottom, middle, and top shelves can hold 45 books, we need to find out how many more shelves she needs to hold the remaining 110 - 45 = 65 books.

Since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, we can divide 65 by 10 to find out how many middle shelves she needs: 65 ÷ 10 = 6.5. Since we can't have half a shelf, we need 7 middle shelves.

So, Elly needs 1 bottom shelf, 7 middle shelves, and 1 top shelf to hold all her books.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we need to divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost of each stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to know how many questions she got right on the first test. 

She got 60% of 70 questions correct on the first test. 
60% of 70 is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. 
She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. 
The total questions is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. 
70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test to pass."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many strawberry cubes Mary makes. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x. 

Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes is 116. 

We can write this as an equation: x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6: x = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. 

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes: 5x - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the number of games she played in a year by the number of points she scored in each game, and then multiply that by the number of years.

She played 40 games per year for 4 years. 
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games
She scored 21 points per game.
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"So, Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5. He found 3 more, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8. Then, he got rid of one bead, which isn't a marble, so he has 8 - 1 = 7.

"To find the total number of flashlights, we need to multiply the number of people by 2. 
There are 4 people, so they have 4 * 2 = 8 flashlights.

To find the total number of candles, we need to know how many rooms have small candles and how many have medium candles. 
There are 8 rooms in total, so half of them will have small candles and the other half will have medium candles. 
Half of 8 is 4, so 4 rooms have small candles and 4 rooms have medium candles.

For the 4 rooms with small candles, there are 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
For the 4 rooms with medium candles, there are 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

So, Brianna's family is using 8 flashlights and 36 candles when the lights go out."
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. 

There are 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so the total number of chips is 2 x 55 = 110 chips.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so it takes 5 x 2 = 10 minutes for each of those sides.
3. The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first side, so it takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes for each of those sides.

Now, let's add up the time it takes to solve the cube:

5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of items, we need to know the number of robots. 

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we know the number of robots and helmets. Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can calculate the number of footballs as follows:

Number of footballs = Number of helmets * 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Now, we have the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. To find the total number of items, we add them together:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with, we need to first find out how many minutes he spends at work in a week. 

He spends 6 hours a day at work. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 6 * 60 = 360 minutes a day at work.

Since he works 5 days a week, he spends 360 * 5 = 1800 minutes at work in a week.

It takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, so we need to divide the total minutes he spends at work by 15 to find out how many calls he deals with.

1800 / 15 = 120

So, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

120"
"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish to dry with the new varnish, we need to first find out how long it would take with the old varnish. 

Since it takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry with the old varnish, it will take 7 minutes for 6 paintings to dry. 

7 minutes * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish. Since it takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry with the new varnish, it will take 12 minutes for 6 paintings to dry. 

12 minutes * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish to dry with the new varnish, we need to subtract the time it takes with the old varnish from the time it takes with the new varnish.

72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the amount of water for each group of plants.

4 plants need half a cup of water, so that's 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

8 plants need 1 cup of water, so that's 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

The rest of the plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. These plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so that's 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add up all the water needed: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Phineas needs to cover. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Since half of the distance is on land, Phineas will need to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute on land, so it will take him 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes to cover the land part.

Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute in water, so it will take him 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes to cover the water part.

To find the total time, we need to add the time it takes to cover the land part and the water part. So, the total time is 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

The answer is 15."
"To find out how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs, we need to divide the number of popsicle sticks he needs (56) by the number of sticks per box (8). 

56 ÷ 8 = 7

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

The answer is: $14.00"
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to know the cost of the additional phones. 

Since the main phone costs $20 and it's twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to break it down day by day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so there were 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Now, we know the number of people on the first three days. To find the total number of people for the rest of the week, we need to multiply the average number of people (60) by the number of days left in the week (5 days).

60 * 5 = 300

Now, we add the people from the first three days to the people from the rest of the week.

50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 360

So, Conor saw a total of 360 people at the beach that week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds of the small and large sunflowers together. 36 + 54 = 90.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we multiply 18 by 3.

18 * 3 = 54

Now, we know Timothy has 54 pens. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we divide 54 by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

27"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the information given. 

First, we know Albert is 36"" tall. 
Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we multiply Albert's height by 2 to find Anne's height. 
Anne's height = 2 * 36"" = 72""

Now, we know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne. 
So, we subtract 2"" from Anne's height to find Jackie's height. 
Jackie's height = 72"" - 2"" = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer. 
Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3"" = 67""

The final answer is: 67"
"To find out how much money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks. 

Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.

The company sells each bar for $2, so the total amount of money it will receive is 70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.

Cost of the first T-shirt: $8
Cost of the second T-shirt: $8 * 0.5 = $4
Total cost of T-shirts: $8 + $4 = $12

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. 

Cost of the shoes: $40 * 0.6 = $24

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends.

Total amount spent: $12 + $24 = $36

The final answer is: 36"
"So Ryan gets $6 each week for doing chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he got 6 * 3 = 18 dollars. 

He spent 1.25 dollars on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so that's 1.25 * 4 = 5 dollars. 

Now he has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left. 

Movie tickets cost 6.50 dollars each. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we need to divide 13 by 6.5. 

13 / 6.5 = 2 

So Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find out how much they spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items.

Ellen bought leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, Lani spent $30 + $100 + $100 = $230.

Now, let's add up the total amount they spent. Ellen spent $105 and Lani spent $230. $105 + $230 = $335.

They spent a total of $335."
"To find out how much Tim makes, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients and the revenue from selling the jars.

First, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients for 1 jar:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 x $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 x $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey: 2 x $10 = $20
Total cost for 1 jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 1 jar: $50

Now, let's calculate the profit from selling 1 jar: $50 - $44 = $6

Now, let's calculate the profit from selling 10 jars: $6 x 10 = $60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total dollar amount, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x 25 = 800 cents.
A dime is worth 10 cents, so 95 dimes are worth 95 x 10 = 950 cents.
A nickel is worth 5 cents, so 120 nickels are worth 120 x 5 = 600 cents.
A penny is worth 1 cent, so 750 pennies are worth 750 x 1 = 750 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 800 + 950 + 600 + 750 = 3100 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 3100 cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 3100 ÷ 100 = 31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is 31 dollars."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to add up all the money she spent and subtract that from the money her parents gave her.

She spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 for a movie ticket, and $8.50 on a bracelet. 
$3.50 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $19.50

Janet's parents gave her $40. 
$40 - $19.50 = $20.50

Janet has $20.50 left.

"Let's break it down step by step:

Randy starts with:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He eats 3 cookies for a snack, one of each flavor:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie
Now he has:
- 8 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 sugar cookies

He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 sugar cookies

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies

He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies

So, Randy now has 6 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 sugar cookies.

"To find out how much Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the total amount for each half of the collection and then add them together.

Half of the collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

For the 6 toys that will be sold for $5 each, Matthew will earn 6 * 5 = $30.

For the other 6 toys that will be sold for $7 each, Matthew will earn 6 * 7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew will earn, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: 72"
"So, Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, that's 6 * 14 = 84 holes. 

Then, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 holes a day. The net change is 9 - 6 = 3 holes a day. 

To fill 84 holes, it will take 84 / 3 = 28 days. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, 28 days is 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"To find the difference in enrollment between the two schools, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4. 

3/4 * 4000 = 3000

Now, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School to find the difference.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

First, let's add the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies: 
2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, let's subtract this number from the total number of cookies:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

So, the Adams family made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

- Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- Igor had the correct number of beakers, which is 7.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 + 16 + 7 = 31.

However, he only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to first find out how many screws he will use. 

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for 4 tables, he will need 4 x 4 = 16 screws.

James has 40 screws. He will use 16 screws. 

To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract 16 from 40. 

40 - 16 = 24

James will have 24 screws left over.

"To find the total amount of money they raised, we need to add up the money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add up the money they all raised: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, we need to find out how long it would take her to run 1 mile. 

We know Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can divide 16 minutes by 2 to find out how long it would take Vanessa to run 1 mile. 

16 minutes / 2 = 8 minutes per mile for Vanessa.

Now, we know Vanessa runs 4 miles, so we multiply 8 minutes by 4 to find out how long it would take her to complete her part of the race.

8 minutes * 4 = 32 minutes.

The answer is 32."
"To find out how much line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate how much line he needs for the dock. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock. 

So, he needs 3 x 200 = 600 feet of line for the dock.

He already has 6 feet of line. 

To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the line he has from the line he needs: 600 - 6 = 594.

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total amount they make in a day and then multiply it by 2.

They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation has 2 meals and a bottle of wine. 

The cost of 2 meals is 2 x $5 = $10. 
Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the total cost per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total amount they make in a night is 6 x $15 = $90.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total amount they make in a week is 2 x $90 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then divide it by the number of watermelons.

The total cost of all the watermelons is $80.

The profit is 25% of the total cost. To find the profit, we multiply the total cost by 0.25 (which is 25% in decimal form).

Profit = 80 * 0.25 = $20

The total selling price is the sum of the total cost and the profit.

Total selling price = Total cost + Profit
= 80 + 20
= $100

Now, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons to find the price of each watermelon.

Price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
= 100 / 50
= $2

The fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $2."

"To solve this problem, we need to know how many oranges they can peel in an hour. 

First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana can peel than Jane in an hour. To do that, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels. 

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"So, Mark gets the radiator for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price. 20% of $400 is 0.2 x 400 = $80. 

Then, he hires a mechanic to install it for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 3 x 50 = $150. 

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator and $150 for the installation. 80 + 150 = $230.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of legs of each animal. 

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's say the number of chickens is x. Then the number of cows is 20 - x.

The total number of legs is 70. So, we can write the equation: 
2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we need to find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people, including Henry. So, 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

Each person can have 14 slices."
