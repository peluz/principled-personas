"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each, so she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. Since she already used 3 eggs for breakfast, she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left for baking.

Now, she has 13 - 16 = -3 eggs left, but since you can't have a negative number of eggs, we need to recalculate the number of eggs she has left after baking. 

Let's recalculate the number of eggs she has left after baking: 
She lays 16 eggs per day, eats 3 for breakfast, and bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs each. Since she bakes 4 muffins, she uses 4 * 4 = 16 eggs for baking. Since she already used 3 eggs for breakfast, she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. However, she bakes 4 muffins, so she actually uses 16 eggs for baking. Since she already used 3 eggs for breakfast, she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. But she bakes 4 muffins, so she actually has 16 - 16 = 0 eggs left. 

Since she has 0 eggs left, she sells 0 eggs at the farmers' market.

However, the question states that she sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. Since she has 0 eggs left, she doesn't sell any eggs at the farmers' market.

The final answer is $0."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the increased value, we multiply the original price by 150% (or 1.5). 
$80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

The new value of the house is $120,000. 

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the repairs ($50,000) from the new value to find the profit.
$120,000 - $50,000 = $70,000

The profit Josh made is $70,000."
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance per sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs per week is 180."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we need to calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens so far.

In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed to the chickens.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed to the chickens.

Total feed given so far = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed per day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given so far from the total amount of feed needed per day.

Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed per day - Total feed given so far
= 60 - 40
= 20 cups

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the second glass, then add them together.

The first glass costs $5.
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost for the first 15 glasses (since the second glass is 60% of the price of the first glass) and the 16th glass.

Cost of the first 15 glasses: 15 * $5 = $75
Cost of the 16th glass: $3

Total cost = $75 + $3 = $78

The final answer is: $78"
"To find the number of sheep in Charleston, we multiply the number of sheep in Seattle by 4. 
Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we multiply the number of sheep in Charleston by 2. 
Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse together. 
20 + 80 + 160 = 260

The total number of sheep is 260."
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to break it down into two parts: the first download and the second download.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 160 GB (80% of 200 GB) at a rate of 2 GB/minute:
Time = Total size / Download rate
Time = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 80 minutes

However, 20 minutes are spent on the restart, so the actual time spent downloading the first 160 GB is:
Time = 80 minutes + 20 minutes
Time = 100 minutes

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 40 GB at the same rate of 2 GB/minute:
Time = Total size / Download rate
Time = 40 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 20 minutes

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time spent downloading the first 160 GB and the time spent downloading the remaining 40 GB:
Total time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 3 hours, the first 2 hours of the return trip, and the last 2 hours of the return trip.

1. Distance covered in the first 3 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

2. Distance covered in the first 2 hours of the return trip:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

3. Distance covered in the last 2 hours of the return trip:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 160 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance covered in the return trip:
Total distance covered in the return trip = 15 miles + 160 miles
Total distance covered in the return trip = 175 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance covered in the entire trip:
Total distance covered = Distance covered in the first 3 hours + Total distance covered in the return trip
Total distance covered = 180 miles + 175 miles
Total distance covered = 355 miles

Since John started 180 miles away from home, we need to subtract the total distance covered from the initial distance to find the distance from home:
Distance from home = Initial distance - Total distance covered
Distance from home = 180 miles - 355 miles
Distance from home = -175 miles

However, distance cannot be negative. This is because John drove 180 miles away from home initially and then drove a total of 355 miles, which is more than the initial distance. Therefore, he is actually 175 miles away from home.

The final answer is: 175"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, we need to calculate her overtime rate first:
Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour

Since she worked 5 hours of overtime (45 hours - 40 hours), her overtime earnings would be:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

Month 1: 60 downloads
Month 2: 3 times the downloads of Month 1 = 3 * 60 = 180 downloads
Month 3: 30% of Month 2 downloads = 30% of 180 = 0.3 * 180 = 54 downloads
Month 3 downloads reduced by 30% from Month 2, so we subtract 30% of Month 2 from Month 2 downloads to get Month 3 downloads.
Month 3 downloads = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Now, we add the downloads for all three months to get the total downloads.
Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year.

The cost to plant the tree is $90.
Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, so the annual revenue is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.
The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

The net profit per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
$90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, we can first combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine the fractions:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3)/2 = 5

Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/2 + x/6 = 5

Combine like terms:

(6x - 2x - 3x + x)/6 - 2 = 5

Combine like terms:

2x/6 - 2 = 5

Simplify the equation:

x/3 - 2 = 5

Add 2 to both sides:

x/3 = 7

Multiply both sides by 3:

x = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the future value of both options.

For the jewelry:
Initial value = $5,000
Market increase = 2.5%
Future value = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial value = $8,000
Market increase = 1.2%
Future value = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the future value of the jewelry ($5,250) is less than the future value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Future value of electronic gadgets - Initial value of electronic gadgets
= $8,160 - $8,000
= $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered westward and the distance covered northward.

For the first part, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can add the distances covered by both trains: 80 + 80 = 160 miles.

For the second part, both trains travel 150 miles northward. Again, we add the distances covered by both trains: 150 + 150 = 300 miles.

Now, we add the distances covered in both parts to find the total distance covered by each train: 160 + 300 = 460 miles.

The distance covered by each train in the two days is 460 miles."
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
Number of hours worked per week as a teacher: 35 hours
Number of weeks worked per year: 50 weeks
Annual salary from teaching: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual salary from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Her annual salary from coaching: 
Number of hours worked per week as a coach: 15 hours
Number of weeks worked per year: 50 weeks
Annual salary from coaching: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual salary from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Total annual salary: $35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

"To find the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of eggs she eats per day and then multiply it by 28 days (since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month).

Claire makes 3 eggs per day. 
In 28 days, she will make 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 84 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks:
84 / 12 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can set up an equation to find the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average speed.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to achieve her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Now, let's add the water from both drinks: 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1 liter from the total amount of water: 49/3 - 1 = 46/3 liters.

To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide 46 by 3: 46 ÷ 3 = 15 remainder 1, so the mixed number is 15 1/3.

The final answer is 15 1/3."
"To find the answer, we need to determine Raymond's age when his son was born. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Samantha's age - 6 = Raymond's age
31 - 6 = 25

So, Raymond was 25 years old when his son was born.

Now, we need to find the difference between the current year and the year Raymond's son was born. Since we don't know the current year, let's call it 'x'. 

We know that Raymond's son is now 23 years old. So, the difference between the current year and the year Raymond's son was born is 23.

We also know that Raymond was 25 years old when his son was born. So, the difference between the current year and Raymond's birth year is 25.

Since the difference between the current year and the year Raymond's son was born is 23, and the difference between the current year and Raymond's birth year is 25, we can set up an equation:

x - 25 = 23

Solving for x, we get:
x = 23 + 25
x = 48

Now that we know the current year is 48, we can find the year Raymond's son was born:

48 - 23 = 25

So, Raymond's son was born 25 years ago.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the number of DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (1 - 0.25 discount).

Original price = Discounted price / 0.75
Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 
Since each carton has 15 servings, we can divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she will need:
60 ÷ 15 = 4

So, Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

Now, we can multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

$16.00"
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop.

Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. 
He then traveled some distance before his second stop. Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, and the total trip was 60 miles, the distance he traveled before his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we need to add the distance he traveled before his first stop (20 miles) to the distance he traveled before his second stop (45 miles). 

20 + 45 = 65 miles

So, Henry traveled 65 miles between his first and second stops.

65"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the cost of the second pair of heels is 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. This can be written as:

33 + 66 = B - 5

Combine the costs of the heels:
99 = B - 5

Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate B:
99 + 5 = B
104 = B

The boots cost $104."
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that their total age now is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying 11x:

Allen's current age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add the guesses together and divide by the number of guesses: 
80 + 60 + 100 = 240
240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog takes per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
   Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
   Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 
   Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4 points
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25
25% of 4 = 4 * 0.25 = 1
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5 points

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
Total points scored = 4 + 5
Total points scored = 9 points"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how much one yogurt costs. To do this, we divide the cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how much money John has, we need to calculate the total amount he received from selling his Lego sets and subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he received 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 each on 8 video games, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He also had $5 left. 

Now, let's subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money from the total amount he received: 195 - 160 - 5 = $30.

Since John spent $30, he now has $30 left. 

To find out how many Lego sets he still has, we need to divide the remaining money by the price of each Lego set: 30 / 15 = 2.

John still has 2 Lego sets."
"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
- He runs 60 miles on the first day.
- He runs half as much on the other two days, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per day.
- Total distance for the other two days is 30 * 2 = 60 miles.
- Total distance for the week is 60 + 60 = 120 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends running:
- He runs 3 hours on the first day.
- He runs half as much on the other two days, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.
- Total time for the other two days is 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours.
- Total time for the week is 3 + 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate his running speed:
Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 120 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 20 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2.

Dana's running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate the time she spends on each activity.

Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time = 3 miles per hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking = 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the given information:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach while holding the gemstone. 

First, we know Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, so the distance is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's reach is 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside the dragon's reach while holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces
Number of pieces remaining = 14

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The final answer is 26."
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since a serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have: 
200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since a serving is 5 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the grams per serving: 
0.8 * 5 = 4 grams

So, you can eat 4 grams of chips."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Total cost = Number of pounds of beeswax and wicks * Cost per pound
Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he needs 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks
Total cost = 2 pounds * $10.00 per pound
Total cost = $20.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours spent on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and then subtract the number of notes she used and the number she had remaining.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes.

She used 220 Post-it notes at work.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she used is 220 + 23 = 243.

Now, we can find the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased by subtracting the total number of notes she had initially and the total number of notes she used from the total number of notes she had remaining.

Number of Post-it notes in the package = Total number of notes remaining - Total number of notes used
= 80 - 243
= -163

However, the number of Post-it notes in the package cannot be negative. This is because we cannot have a negative number of items in a package.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes, and she used 220 at work. She also had 23 Post-it notes remaining. 

The total number of Post-it notes she used is 220 + 23 = 243. However, this is more than the initial number of Post-it notes she had. This means that the problem is incorrect, and we need to re-evaluate it.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

200 / 40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the cost of the blue ties. 

The cost of the red ties is 1.5 * 40 = $60 each.

The total cost of the red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the red ties:

200 + 600 = $800.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces.

48 inches / 6 inches = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate the number of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs he sells per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)
Distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes to travel back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a single toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove. 

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue of both days:
$520 (Thursday) > $480 (Friday)
Thursday has higher revenue.

To find the difference in revenue, we subtract the revenue of Friday from the revenue of Thursday:
$520 - $480 = $40

The final answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we multiply 12 by 3 to find Patchy's kittens.

12 * 3 = 36

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had to find the total number of kittens.

36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Initial lollipops = 30
Lollipops eaten = 2
Remaining lollipops = 30 - 2 = 28

Now, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags Jean can fill.

Number of bags = Remaining lollipops / 2
= 28 / 2
= 14

Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops each.

Final answer: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to subtract the cost of the ticket and popcorn from the total amount of money he has.

Cost of ticket and popcorn: $7 + $7 = $14
Remaining money: $42 - $14 = $28

Now, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a single ticket to find out how many times he can go to the movies:

$28 ÷ $7 = 4

So, Peter can go to the movies 4 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees are $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the individual raspberries.

Number of clusters: 6
Number of raspberries per cluster: 20
Total raspberries in clusters: 6 * 20 = 120

There are 187 raspberries in total."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe, so the number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25, which is 0.2 * 25 = 5.

We also know that 2 oranges are sour. 

So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 7.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 - 7 = 18.

Therefore, there are 18 good oranges."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the brooch first. 

The cost of the material is $500 and the cost of construction is $800. 
So, the total cost of the brooch is $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost. 
10% of $1300 is 0.1 * $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the brooch. 
$1300 + $130 = $1430.

Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch."
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total amount she receives for the first 20 years and the amount she receives for the remaining 10 years.

For the first 20 years, her annual pension is $50,000. So, the total amount she receives for the first 20 years is:
$50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

For the remaining 10 years, she receives 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension after 20 years is:
$50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000
5% of $1,000,000 is $50,000. So, her annual pension for the remaining 10 years is $50,000.

Now, we add the total amount she receives for the first 20 years and the amount she receives for the remaining 10 years:
$1,000,000 + $50,000 = $1,050,000

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $1,050,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), Aleena paid $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the amounts paid for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used for the last fill-up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (tank capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used for the last fill-up (4 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we can multiply the miles per gallon by the remaining gallons in the tank (3 gallons) to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

25 miles per gallon × 3 gallons = 75 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 75 miles on a single tank of gas."
"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the hours spent on each activity per week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV per session. Since he reads for half as long, he spends 2 / 2 = 1 hour reading per session.

Total hours spent per session = 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours per session.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent per week = 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours/week.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent = 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and there are 4 schools. So, the total number of teams is 2 * 4 = 8.

Each team has 5 players, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of players is 5 * 8 = 40.

Each team has 1 coach, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of coaches is 1 * 8 = 8.

Now, we add the total number of teams, players, and coaches to find the total number of people. 
8 (teams) + 40 (players) + 8 (coaches) = 56

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can find the square footage of the other levels as follows:

Level 1: 16
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
Level 4: 4 / 2 = 2

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total square footage by 4 to find the average:
30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the remaining days in the year.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days:
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Since there are 365 days in a year, the remaining days in the year are:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

Now, let's calculate the amount of dog food used in the remaining days:
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, we add the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days and the remaining days:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used by 110 cups to find out how many bags Cecilia will use:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry.

Sarah's laundry: 400 pounds
David's laundry: 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 2 to find Raymond's laundry.

Raymond's laundry: 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David.

Difference: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Since 18 is a multiple of 3, we can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers for $2.50 each.
Cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Since 18 is not a multiple of 2, we can buy 9 packages of 2 flowers for $1 each.
Cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of the better option from the cost of the other option:
$15 - $9 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

"To solve this problem, let's use the information given. 

Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22. So, the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22.

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since x is the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The football team won 15 games."
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing. 

Gene was 23 years old when he started vacationing and is now 34 years old. 

Number of years = Current age - Starting age

"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

The first time it rang for 4 times.
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 
4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
New salary = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2: 
Initial salary = $660
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
New salary = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3: 
Initial salary = $726
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
New salary = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4: 
Initial salary = $798.60
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
New salary = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5: 
Initial salary = $878.46
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
New salary = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6: 
Initial salary = $966.306
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
New salary = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount each adult and child will eat, then add them together.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults, so the total amount for adults is 10 * 20 = 200 lbs.

A child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. There are 5 children, so the total amount for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children together: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children.

Let's denote the age of Jackson as J, Amy as A, Corey as C, and James as J.

We know that:
1. James is 10 years old.
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so C = J + 1.
3. Corey is 2 years older than Amy, so A = C - 2.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so A = J + 5.

Now, we can substitute the value of C from equation 2 into equation 3:
A = (J + 1) - 2
A = J - 1

Now, we can equate the two expressions for A:
J + 5 = J - 1

Subtracting J from both sides:
5 = -1

This is a contradiction, which means the given information is inconsistent. However, we can still find the age of Jackson by using the relationship between James and Corey.

From equation 2, we know that C = J + 1. Since James is 10 years old, we can substitute this value into the equation:
10 = J + 1
Subtracting 1 from both sides:
9 = J

So, Jackson is 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation: 
Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2 seconds
38 = Gerald's time + 2

Now, we need to find Gerald's original time. 
Gerald's time = 38 - 2
Gerald's time = 36 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 36 seconds. 
10% of 36 = 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds

Now, we add the 10% improvement to Gerald's original time to find his new time. 
Gerald's new time = 36 + 3.6
Gerald's new time = 39.6 seconds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats.

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12.

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first determine how many ounces of tomatoes she started with. Since she lost half of the volume, we can multiply the final volume by 2 to get the initial volume.

Initial volume = 2 * 32 ounces = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide the initial volume by 16 to find out how many cans she used:

Number of cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used:

Number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he needs to read per day:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of soda for dinner, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which it covers the distance.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. 

First, we find the rate at which the fog bank covers the distance: 
3 miles / 10 minutes = 0.3 miles per minute

Now, we divide the total distance of the city by the rate:
42 miles / 0.3 miles per minute = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to find the inner dimensions of each box and then multiply them together.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
- Width: 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
- Height: 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

Now, we multiply the inner dimensions together to find the volume of one box:
Volume = Length * Width * Height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:
Total inner volume = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the total time Frankie watched TV:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes as 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time for Wednesday is 30x minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5x hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (for the 30-minute show) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time watched is 7 hours. So, we can set up the equation:

1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:
5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5 from both sides:
0.5x = 2

Multiply both sides by 2:
x = 4

So, Frankie watched 4 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas, we need to multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons purchased.

Cost per gallon: $3.00
Number of gallons: 10

Total cost = Cost per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost = $3.00 * 10
Total cost = $30.00

Now, let's calculate the cashback rewards:
Cashback per gallon: $0.20
Number of gallons: 10

Total cashback = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, let's subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount:
Final amount = Total cost - Total cashback
Final amount = $30.00 - $2.00
Final amount = $28.00

The final amount with the gas and cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each person.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can find the average by adding their roll-ups and dividing by 2.

Average roll-ups: (48 + 42) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find the rate at which the boat is taking on water, we need to first find the rate at which Julia rows. 

We know that Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find her rate, we can divide the distance by the time: 
20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of water taken on per second:
2 liters / 10 feet = x liters / 1.25 feet

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
2 * 1.25 = 10x
2.5 = 10x
x = 2.5 liters per foot

Now that we know the rate at which the boat is taking on water, we can find the total amount of water taken on by multiplying the rate by the time it took Julia to reach the shore:
2.5 liters/foot * 64 feet = 160 liters

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks as 'x'. 

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the equation:

6 * Brittany's phone capacity = 1800

To find Brittany's phone capacity, we divide both sides by 6:

Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks. We can set up the equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * x

Since we know Brittany's phone capacity is 300, we can set up the equation:

300 = 50 * x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to calculate the new selling price. 
The original price was $180, and it increased by 50%, so the new price is: 
$180 + ($180 * 0.5) = $180 + $90 = $270

Now, we subtract the total cost from the new selling price to find the profit: 
$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio. The ratio is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:
30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

"To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate his salary four years ago and then add 30% to it. 

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
To find 30% of $40,000, we multiply 40,000 by 0.3. 
30% of $40,000 = 40,000 * 0.3 = $12,000. 
So, Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000.

Now, we need to find Adrien's current salary. 
His salary increased by 40% four years later. 
To find 40% of $52,000, we multiply 52,000 by 0.4. 
40% of $52,000 = 52,000 * 0.4 = $20,800. 
So, Adrien's current salary is $52,000 + $20,800 = $72,800.

Lylah's salary increased by 30% four years later. 
To find 30% of Lylah's salary four years ago, we multiply Lylah's salary four years ago by 0.3. 
Since we don't know Lylah's salary four years ago, we need to find it first. 
We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $52,000, and it's 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. 
Let's call Lylah's salary four years ago 'x'. 
We can set up the equation: 
52,000 = x + 0.3x 
Combine like terms: 
52,000 = 1.3x 
Divide both sides by 1.3: 
x = 40,000 

Now that we know Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can find her current salary. 
To find 30% of $40,000, we multiply 40,000 by 0.3. 
30% of $40,000 = 40,000 * 0.3 = $12,000. 
So, Lylah's current salary is $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000.

Now, we can find the total salary the two were receiving four years later. 
Adrien's current salary is $72,800, and Lylah's current salary is $52,000. 
Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary 
Total salary = $72,800 + $52,000

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

Let's start by finding out how many letters Jennie stamped. Since she put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

60 (letters needing stamps) / 3 = 20 letters stamped

Now, we know that the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:

30 (total letters) - 20 (letters stamped) = 10 letters

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one: W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 4Q and B = 2Q into this equation, we get: 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700.

Combine like terms: 7Q = 700.

Divide both sides by 7: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(200) = 400.

Now, let's add the cost of food items: 
Food items: milk and eggs. 
Total cost of food items: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Total cost of everything: 11 (non-food items with tax) + 5 (food items) = 16 dollars

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total expenses, we need to calculate the cost of bleach and cloths for all 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach, so 8 clients will need 8 * 2 = 16 bottles of bleach.
Each bottle of bleach costs $2, so 16 bottles will cost 16 * $2 = $32.

Each client needs 1 pack of cloths, so 8 clients will need 8 packs of cloths.
Each pack of cloths costs $5, so 8 packs will cost 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses = cost of bleach + cost of cloths
Total expenses = $32 + $40
Total expenses = $72

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year.

First, we need to find the total number of pineapples per year. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, and John has 10 hectares, we multiply 100 pineapples/hectare by 10 hectares:

100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):

1000 pineapples * 4 = 4000 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

"To find the total number of legos, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the total number of pieces: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. The total number of bees that left in the first 3 periods is 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees.
5. Since 15 bees returned in the first 3 periods, the number of bees that left and didn't return is 105 - 15 = 90 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive, which is 90 bees.

Therefore, Debra saw 90 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:
$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change:
$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of friends James has on Facebook.

We know that Charlie has 12 friends and that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. 

Let's represent the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write an equation:

3x = 12

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply the number of friends Dorothy has by 4:

James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same unit (feet) and then divide it by their respective speeds.

Steve's distance in feet: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's distance in feet: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes the race first, he will be waiting for Tim. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Now, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie: 
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change:
$10 - $6 = $4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * 30 = 20 fries.
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 20 (raccoon) = 50 fries.
8. The ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Now, to find the initial number of fries in the pack, we need to add the fries eaten by the seagull, pigeons, and raccoon to the 5 fries left behind:

50 (total eaten) + 5 (left behind) = 55 fries.

So, the pack initially had 55 fries."
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours for Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches.

Now, we add the total lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet.

The total length of the baked goods is 280 feet."
"To find the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes for 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required for all the apes:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the distance each person ran, we need to calculate the total distance for each.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, he covers the entire length of the field twice. So, his total distance is 2 * 100 yards = 200 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering the entire length of the field, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, covering an additional 60 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 20 yards back). Since she does this 34 times, her total distance is 100 yards * 34 + 60 yards * 34 = 3400 yards + 2040 yards = 5440 yards.

Now, we compare the distances covered by Blake and Kelly. Blake ran 200 yards, while Kelly ran 5440 yards. The difference is 5440 - 200 = 5240 yards.

The winner is Kelly, and she ran 5240 yards farther than the loser, Blake."

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Finn initially saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so we add them to the initial number: 11 + 6 = 17
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we subtract them from the total: 17 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The tank had 17 feet of water on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so we need to find two thirds of 24.
   Two thirds of 24 is (2/3) * 24 = 16.

The tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each item.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.

We also know that one red car costs $4, so R = 4.

We are also given that an action figure costs $5, so A = 5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * 5
D = 15

Now, we can find the total cost of all the toys:
Total cost = (number of red cars) * (cost of a red car) + (number of action figures) * (cost of an action figure) + (number of the doll) * (cost of the doll)
Total cost = 5 * 4 + 3 * 5 + 1 * 15

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Seth's current age be S and Brooke's current age be B.

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write another equation: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B: S = 2(8) = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so he walks 2 * 10 = 20 miles on weekends.

To find the total miles walked in a week, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and Sally Thirty-two (8).

Minimum payment for student loans: $300
Minimum payment for credit card: $200
Minimum payment for mortgage: $500
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, let's add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

This is the new monthly payment. To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

"To find the total time it will take Billy to peel and cut the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and cutting each potato separately and then add them together.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for peeling and cutting by 60.

Time to peel 60 potatoes: 1.5 minutes * 60 = 90 minutes
Time to cut 60 potatoes: 5 seconds * 60 = 300 seconds

Now, we need to convert the time to peel the potatoes from minutes to seconds for consistency. 
90 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5400 seconds

Now we add the time to peel and cut the potatoes together:
5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes and seconds:
5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to peel and cut the 60 potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's start by calculating the total revenue. They sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass costs $0.50, so the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. Since they made $25 in profit, their total revenue is $25 + $10 = $35.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2. Since they make 20 glasses per gallon, the cost of sugar per glass is $2 / 20 = $0.10. The total cost per gallon is $3 + $0.10 = $3.10. Since they made $35 in revenue, their total cost is $35 - $25 = $10.

Since they made 1 gallon of lemonade, the total cost of lemons is $3.

"To find out how much Zaid has left after all these expenses and donations, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent: 
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. 
   1/4 of 6000 is 6000 * 1/4 = 1500.

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel: 
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. 
   1/3 of 6000 is 6000 * 1/3 = 2000.

3. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses: 
   6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500.

4. Calculate the amount donated to charity: 
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity. 
   Half of 2500 is 2500 * 1/2 = 1250.

5. Calculate the remaining amount after charity donation: 
   2500 - 1250 = 1250.

6. Calculate the total amount spent on his daughter and wife: 
   Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$. 
   Total amount spent on his family is 200 + 700 = 900.

7. Calculate the final amount left: 
   1250 - 900 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of crabs each person has and then add them together.

We know that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

Total earnings for the first two weeks = $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the winner got, we need to calculate 3/4 of the total number of students who voted.

3/4 of 80 = (3/4) * 80
= 3 * 20
= 60

So, the winner got 60 votes.

To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information that Jan is 30 years old.

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. 
Since Mark was 5 years older than that, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.

Now, we know that Mark is 2 years younger than Jean. 
So, Jean's age would be Mark's age + 2 years. 
Jean's age = 20 + 2 = 22 years old.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together. 

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. 
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per leg, so their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in their times is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3, and then subtract that from 1.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (1, 2, and 3) out of 6 possible outcomes.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1 - 3/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

Now, we can find the difference in probabilities:

(1/2) - (1/4) = 1/4

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/4) * 100 = 25%

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

25"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first find out how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's apples as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and the rabbits. 

The hamsters have 10 cages, each with 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

The rabbits have 20 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces used for the rabbits is 20.

The total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70.

Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of straw pieces used for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's say the number of rats in each cage is x. Then, the total number of straw pieces used for the rats is 3x * 6 = 18x.

Since the total number of straw pieces used for the rats is 90, we can set up the equation 18x = 90.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 18: x = 90 / 18 = 5.

So, there are 5 rats in each cage."
"To calculate the interest, we need to first calculate the interest for one month, then multiply it by 3 months.

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Total interest for 3 months = Interest for one month * 3
Total interest for 3 months = $2 * 3 = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the transportation cost:
Total cost = Total cost + Transportation cost
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, let's find the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total revenue - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

The final answer is: 114"
"To find the total cost of the food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we need to find the total cost of all expenses.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of hours he collects peaches by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

First, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

Total amount of insects per week = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Insects per day = Total amount of insects per week / Number of days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

The ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To find the total number of trees Tom plants in 10 years, we multiply the number of trees he plants per year by the number of years: 
10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Since Tom chops down 2 trees a year, we subtract the total number of trees he chops down from the total number of trees he planted:
100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of trees Tom had after 10 years. To do this, we multiply the total number of trees by 0.3:
80 trees * 0.3 = 24 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees Tom had after 10 years:
80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

The final answer is: 56"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday, one third of the flamingos were taken back, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, 18 - 6 = 12 flamingos were left.
3. The remaining 12 flamingos were painted white and put back out, so now there are 12 white flamingos.
4. On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added to the collection.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos. There are 18 pink flamingos and 12 white flamingos. 

18 (pink) - 12 (white) = 6

So, there are 6 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first calculate the total cost of the crayons. 

She needs 5 crayons, and each crayon costs $2. 
Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon

There are 6267 children in Soda."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.

Step 2: In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had. 
   3 * 20 = 60
   Total cards after the first month = 20 + 60 = 80

Step 3: In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   60 - 20 = 40
   Total cards after the second month = 80 + 40 = 120

Step 4: In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   Combined number of cards in the first and second months = 60 + 40 = 100

   Total cards after the third month = 120 + 200 = 320

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"To find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher, we need to divide the total number of sentences by 2, since he edits an equal number for both publishers.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we multiply the number of sentences by the rate:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we multiply the amount Mark earns from Publisher A by 2:

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of what he earns from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. 
So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets in a day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his weekly earnings, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

John's weekly earnings: $2000
Number of weeks in a year: 52

Weekly earnings for the year: $2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's calculate the monetary reward from the award: 
Award amount: $5000
Percentage of raise: 5%
Raise amount: $5000 * 0.05 = $250
New salary after the raise: $2000 + $250 = $2250

Since the award was received on the first day of the year, John will receive the raise for the entire year. So, we need to calculate the total amount he will earn for the year with the new salary.

Total earnings for the year: $2250 * 52 = $117,000

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich for lunch every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, he ate omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the required score, we need to first find the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. 

Since there are 6 tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first 5 tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the total score Brinley needs, we subtract the lowest score from the required total score: 558 - 71 = 487.

Now, we subtract the sum of the remaining 4 scores from the total score Brinley needs: 487 - 358 = 129.

This means Brinley needs a score of 129 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 20 dozen cups is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 cups.

We also know that half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates.

The total cost of 6 plates is $6000.

Since 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of 6 plates, we can set up an equation:

20 dozen cups = 6 plates - $1200
20 dozen cups = $6000 - $1200
20 dozen cups = $4800

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 cup. To do this, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by 20:

Cost of 1 cup = $4800 / 20
Cost of 1 cup = $240

"To find out how much Sara needs to earn, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. 

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. So, the total cost is $30 + $20 * 2 = $70.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $5, which is 12 sessions.

To find out how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to earn $60, we divide $60 by $4, which is 15 sessions.

Since she can earn $5 per babysitting session, she can earn $60 in 12 sessions. However, she needs to earn $60 in 15 sessions. So, she needs to mow the lawn 15 - 12 = 3 more times.

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs collected is 3r + 5w.

We are given that the total number of eggs collected is 42. So, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can divide the total distance by his speed to find the time he spends walking.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the number of customers on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago is x - 4(4) = x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x - 4(4) = 2x - 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 16 to both sides, we get:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

-2x = -48

Dividing both sides by -2, we get:

x = 24

So, the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago was 24 gallons.

Since the small pool is leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 4(4) = 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

The final answer is: 8"

"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is $200. 
So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She will pay $165 per month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980.

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. We add 3 to each of their current ages.
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored.
251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54

Jojo scored 54 points."

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

James initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 
He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.33%. 

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%."

"To find out how many tomatoes Steve eats per week, we need to multiply the number of tomatoes he eats per day by 7.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of that amount, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to find out how many vines Steve needs to produce 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide 63 by 3 to find out how many vines Steve needs:

63 / 3 = 21

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has and then compare it to John's candies.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say Robert has x candies. 
Then John has 2x candies. 
We know John has 54 candies, so 2x = 54. 
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 27. 
So Robert has 27 candies.

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. 
James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies: 
54 - 33 = 21.

"To find out how many letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he receives and sends.

He has 3 remaining penpals, and each sends 2 letters a week, so he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes he spends writing per week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 7 * 60 = 420 minutes in a week.

To find out how many minutes he spends writing per week, we multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write one page: 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

Now, we can convert the minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for 'x', we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:

Initially, there were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240.

He divides the new cows equally among the 20 stalls, so each stall now has 240 / 20 = 12 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 12 * 8 = 96.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52:
Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits:
Andrea's fruits = 52 (apples) + 24 (bananas) = 76
Jamal's fruits = 44 (apples) + 48 (bananas) = 92

Total fruits = Andrea's fruits + Jamal's fruits = 76 + 92 = 168

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * 350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * 350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Now, let's add the total fees to the selling price:
$350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

The total price of the house is $409,500. To find out how much more it is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
Remaining loan amount: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000
Net proceeds: $400,000 - $368,000 = $32,000

The final answer is: $32,000"
"To find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees, we need to calculate 40% of the initial time it took to heat up to 300 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes.

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

Now, we need to find the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. 

So, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Now, we need to add the time it took to heat up the oil and the cooking time to get the total time.

Total time = 28 minutes (heating up) + 23 minutes (cooking) = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: 51"

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, we multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom: 
2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

To find the total number of windows in the additional windows not connected to bedrooms, we multiply the number of houses by the number of additional windows per house: 
2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 
12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

The total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find the total cost of the items purchased, we need to add the cost of cocoa, laundry, and pasta.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To find the total cost of the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds separately.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

Therefore, Sean has to memorize 138 lines."
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, find the number of cards with the letter A: 
   2/5 of 80 = (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards

2. Now, find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter A:
   80 - 32 = 48 cards

3. Next, find the number of cards with the letter B:
   1/2 of the remaining 48 cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards

4. Now, find the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter B:
   48 - 24 = 24 cards

5. Finally, find the number of cards with the letter C:
   5/8 of the remaining 24 cards = (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to know their current ages. Since we are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, we can represent their current ages as x and 20 - x.

In 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (20 - x + 10).

Simplifying the expression, we get 20 + 20 = 40.

The final answer is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, substitute R = 6S into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expand the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately.

The cost of the popsicles: 20 popsicles * $0.25 = $5.00
The cost of the ice cream bars: 4 ice cream bars * $0.50 = $2.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00."
"To find the number of spots on the mambas, we first need to find the number of spots on one mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2 to find the number of spots on a mamba.

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the mambas:
Total spots on mambas = 35 * 60 = 2100

Next, we can find the total number of spots on all the cobras:
Total spots on cobras = 70 * 40 = 2800

Now, we can find the total number of spots on all the snakes:
Total spots on all snakes = 2100 + 2800 = 4900

Finally, we can find half the number of spots on all the snakes:
Half the total spots = 4900 / 2 = 2450

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of team members, coaches, and their guests.

Number of team members: 12
Number of coaches: 3
Number of guests: 12 * 2 = 24

Total number of people: 12 + 3 + 24 = 39

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost will be 13 * $15 = $195.

The final answer is $195."
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first find the total length of the space between the topaz gemstones. 

Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, and each is 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total space between the gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch) to find the number of beads used.

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 * 4 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

68"
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in the second week:
40 (Alani) + 80 (Braylen) + 120 (Margot) = 240 stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we need to add the stories from the first and second week:
20 (Alani) + 40 (Braylen) + 60 (Margot) = 120 stories (first week)
240 (second week) + 120 (first week) = 360 stories.

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 
Ann's brother's current age = 9 * 2 = 18 years.

Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years.

The final answer is 21."
"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters = 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes = 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

The remaining stars are 76 - (24 + 12) = 40 stars.

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we can divide the remaining stars by 5 to find the number of rows: 40 / 5 = 8 rows.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the flagstones, we need to multiply the number of flagstones by their individual weight.

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight per flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"Let's break down the information given:

Ali has 22 medals.
Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's call this number 'x'. We can set up the equation:

39 = 10x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9 times 10, which is 39.

The final answer is: 39"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars.

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12.

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate the total amount of money Susan earns, we need to first calculate the total time she worked. 

She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she paused for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert 2.5 hours to minutes. 
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money she earned:
150 minutes / 10 minutes per $5 = 15

So, Susan earns $15 for the online task."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike: 21 > 20, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim: 18 < 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony: 42 > 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points:
- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim: 18
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add the points of all three players:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is 83."
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to first determine how many oranges the sons washed.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges.
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges initially. So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

Now, let's add the total count of each activity done in the two days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities done in the two days is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the number of crates he sold on each day.

On Monday and Friday, he was closed, so he didn't sell any crates.
On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
On the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Since his target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the total number of bids (including Carmen's) is 4. 

The bids are: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids at $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of her bids: $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total distance driven per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year. 

Since John drives to work and back each day, the total distance driven per day is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. 

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 

Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of driving per year. 

The cost of driving per mile is $2, so the total cost of driving per year is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000.

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800.

The total cost of driving per year is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"

2 * 39 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the folded paper.

When a piece of paper is folded in half, it creates two identical halves. 

- The left side of the folded paper will have 16 pages (pages 1-16).
- The right side of the folded paper will have 16 pages (pages 17-32).

Since each half of the paper is used to create the left and right sides, we need 2 pieces of paper to create the left and right sides.

However, we also need to consider the front and back sides of the folded paper. 

- The left side of the folded paper will have 16 pages (pages 1-16), and we need 2 pieces of paper to create the left front and left back.
- The right side of the folded paper will have 16 pages (pages 17-32), and we need 2 pieces of paper to create the right front and right back.

So, in total, we need 2 pieces of paper for the left side and 2 pieces of paper for the right side, and 2 pieces of paper for the front and back sides. 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper used is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

"To find out how much Annika spent, we need to calculate half of $50 and add the additional $10 she spent on rides.

Half of $50 is $25. 
$25 (half of $50) + $10 (for rides) = $35

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought:
$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15

Annika has $15 left.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Elise sold in the first year. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the current year is x/2.

We know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We also know that the number of books sold in the first year is x, and the number of books sold in the current year is x/2. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 = 200

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

2x + x = 400

Combine like terms:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to 133 books sold in the first year.

Now, we know that the number of books sold in the first year is 133, and the number of books sold in the current year is 133/2 = 66.5. Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to 66 books sold in the current year.

We know that each book sells for 20$, so the total amount of money earned in the first year is 133 * 20 = 2660.

The total amount of money earned in the current year is 66 * 20 = 1320.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is 1320.

The final answer is: 1320"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:
10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for the month would be:
$100/day * 30 days = $3000

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the whole month. So, his total earnings for April would be:
$3000 + $300 = $3300

The final answer is: $3300"

"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we need to divide the total weight he loses by the number of weeks it takes him to lose that weight. 

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds per week.

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Sandy by the amount of weight Joey loses per week to find out how much weight Sandy loses per week. 

2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

Since Sandy loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, it will take her 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey."
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in 15 days.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we divide 15 by 3 to find the number of arms grown: 15 ÷ 3 = 5. So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we divide 15 by 5 to find the number of legs grown: 15 ÷ 5 = 3. So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and legs: 5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8.

The person will grow 8 new limbs after 15 days."
"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract the total cost from the amount he has: 
$6000 - $1950 = $4050

So, Theo has $4050 left to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the rest of the family.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
The rest of the family consists of 5 - 3 = 2 people, and they eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and Cera's current age as C. We are given that Cera is currently 46 years old, so C = 46.

We are also given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. This means that six years ago, Noah's age was N - 6, and Cera's age was C - 6. Since Noah was half as old as Cera, we can set up the equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(C - 6)

We can substitute C = 46 into this equation:

N - 6 = (1/2)(46 - 6)
N - 6 = (1/2)(40)
N - 6 = 20
N = 26

Now that we know Noah's current age, we can find the population of Chile six years ago. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Let's denote the population of Chile six years ago as P. We can set up the equation:

P = 3000N
P = 3000(26)
P = 78000

Since the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, the population of Chile now is 3000 times the population of Chile six years ago. Let's denote the population of Chile now as P_now. We can set up the equation:

P_now = 3000P
P_now = 3000(78000)
P_now = 234000000

The final answer is: 234000000"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16 people.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14 people.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. 
   Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 
   2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
   So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 
   Total marbles = 20 (bought) + 8 (given by father) = 28 marbles.

2. Now, add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him. 
   Total marbles = 50 (in the store) + 28 (bought and given) = 78 marbles.

3. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight. 
   Total weight = 78 marbles * 2kgs = 156kgs.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156kgs."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = Length * Width * Depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 * 0.1
Total Cost = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Since the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

We know that the total number of electric wires is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women.

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:
Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Now, we know that 3 men left, and 10 people in total left. Since we know that 3 men left, the number of women who left is:
Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:
Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.
2. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is $1."
"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, but we don't know how many pencils are in each box. Let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2.

Meg has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46.

Since the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Combine the constants:
3x + 48 = 26

Subtract 48 from both sides:
3x = -22

Divide both sides by 3:
x = -22/3

Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, this doesn't make sense. However, let's re-examine the problem. We can assume that the total number of pencils is 26, and we need to find the number of boxes Jam has.

Let's re-evaluate the equation:
3x + 2 = 26

Subtract 2 from both sides:
3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 8

So, each box has 8 pencils. 

Now, we know the number of pencils in each box. To find the total number of boxes, we need to add the number of boxes Jam has to the number of loose pencils. 

Jam has 3 boxes, and Meg has 46 pencils. We don't need to include Meg's pencils in the total number of boxes.

The total number of boxes is 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes.
Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we don't know the initial temperature of the coffee, we can't directly calculate the total cooling effect. However, we can express it as a variable. Let's call the initial temperature of the coffee 'x'. The total cooling effect of the ice cubes is 13 degrees.

Step 2: Calculate the total weakening effect of the added ice cubes.
Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since we have 'n' ice cubes, the total weakening effect is 12n milliliters.

Step 3: Calculate the total weakening effect of the added cream.
Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Step 4: Calculate the total weakening effect of the coffee.
The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream. Since we don't know the number of ice cubes, we can't calculate the total weakening effect directly. However, we can express it as 12n + 15.

Step 5: Calculate the final temperature of the coffee.
The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, so the final temperature is x - 65.

Step 6: Set up an equation to relate the initial temperature, the total cooling effect, and the total weakening effect.
Since the final temperature is the initial temperature minus the total cooling effect, we can set up the equation: x - (13n + 15) = x - 65.

Step 7: Solve for 'n'.
To solve for 'n', we need to know the initial temperature 'x'. However, we can simplify the equation by canceling out 'x' on both sides: -13n - 15 = -65. Add 15 to both sides: -13n = -50. Divide both sides by -13: n = 50/13 ≈ 3.85.

Step 8: Calculate the total weakening effect.
Now that we know 'n', we can calculate the total weakening effect: 12n + 15 = 12(3.85) + 15 ≈ 46.2 + 15 ≈ 61.2 milliliters.

The final answer is: 61.2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got in total. Since they left with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, we can set up an equation.

Let's say the total number of old records they brought in is x.

Since they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of new records they got is x/2.

We know that the total number of new records they got is 7, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 7

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's find the total number of people who got on the bus at the first and second stops. 
5 people got on at the first stop, and 8 people got on at the second stop. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the first and second stops is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop (7) from the total number of people heading to the third stop (20). 
20 - 7 = 13.

Since we already know that 13 people got on at the first and second stops, we can conclude that 13 people got on the bus at the terminal."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to recharge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"To find the total amount the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned: The customer spent $80 and gets $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. The total rewards are 4 * $1 = $4.

2. Apply the rewards: The customer used their rewards, so the price after rewards is $80 - $4 = $76.

3. Apply the coupon: The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off. The price after the coupon is $76 - $8 = $68.

The customer paid $68 on this shopping trip."
"To calculate the net pay for Job A, we need to first calculate the total income and then subtract the taxes.

Total income for Job A = $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000
Total taxes for Job A = 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
Net pay for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

To calculate the net pay for Job B, we need to first calculate the net income after property tax, and then apply the tax rate.

Net income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Taxes for Job B = 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
Net pay for Job B = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

So, the smallest group has 40 students.

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, let's find the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To find the weight of the blue beetle, we know the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle. Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal. The container weighs 20 pounds. 

Total weight = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird + weight of container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 240 pounds"

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, which has 36 cookies. So, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, first, we need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of 2 shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 
The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24. 
The amount Davos paid is the original price minus the discount, which is $60 - $24 = $36.

The final answer is $36."
"To find the difference in daily revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from tractors and silos separately.

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

The total daily revenue is $1000 + $1100 = $2100.

To find the percentage increase, we need to find the difference in revenue and divide it by the original revenue.

Original revenue: $1000
Difference in revenue: $1100 - $1000 = $100
Percentage increase: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find the total monthly cost, we need to calculate the weekly cost of food and multiply it by 4, then add the monthly cost of treats and medicine.

Weekly cost of food: $25 * 4 = $100
Monthly cost of food: $100 * 4 = $400
Monthly cost of treats: $20
Monthly cost of medicine: $100

Total monthly cost: $400 + $20 + $100 = $520

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
$520 * 12 = $6240

The final answer is: $6240"
"To find the total time of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the time for each activity and add them together.

Monday: 1 hour
Tuesday: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Wednesday: 0.5 hours (half an hour)
Thursday: Half as long as the cooking class, so half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours
Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add the time for each activity:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The total time for Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To find out how many plant pots April needs in total, we need to calculate the number of pots for the roses. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

Now, let's add the pots for the daisies and roses: 30 (daisies) + 60 (roses) = 90 pots.

Since April already had 100 pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

Andrea initially had $36.
She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4.
Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity.

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours
Total time spent on these activities: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since 30% of the total time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time:
0.3 * total time = 6 hours
total time = 6 / 0.3
total time = 20 hours

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing:
Time spent sightseeing = 40% of total time
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 20
Time spent sightseeing = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job:
20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job:
15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs:
$200 + $75 = $275

Finally, let's add her initial savings to her total earnings:
$275 + $80 = $355

Annabelle still needs $45 to save for the phone."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. 

The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet. 
So, the height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. 
The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. 
So, the height of the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he had.

The cost of 6 toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12.
The cost of 5 teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After buying the items, he has $28 - $17 = $11.
His mother then gives him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5. Since she wants to play once, the total cost for mini-golf is $5.

The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

She also wants $5 in arcade tokens.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 (budget) - $30 (total cost) = $60.

Since each friend will cost $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 / $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party."
"To find out how much money Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: 25 cents = $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as his change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs, so he must have spent $8 - $2 = $6 on candy.

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy ($6) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$6 / $1.5 = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

4"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's son's age as 'x'. 

Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as:

2x - 5 = 45

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:
2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2:
2x / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the other two, so it is 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance of one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer is 0.05 days, which is less than 1 day."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds, we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
For 3 collie beds, we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distance to his friend's house, the detour, and the distance back home.

Distance to friend's house = 200 miles
Detour = 10 miles
Distance back home = 240 miles

Total distance = 200 + 10 + 240 = 450 miles

Now, let's calculate the time taken for each part of the trip:

Time taken to reach friend's house = Distance / Speed
Time taken to reach friend's house = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours

Time taken for detour = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours

Time taken to return home = Distance / Speed
Time taken to return home = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken = Time taken to reach friend's house + Time taken for detour + Time taken to return home
Total time taken = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

The total time taken for the trip is 5.99 hours."
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

Total students = 96
Absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Number of boys present = Total students - Absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

The final answer is 87."
"To find the number of boys, we need to multiply the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we add the number of girls and boys to find the total number of kids in the park.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 

We know that 3x - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 

We also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which means 3(3x - 5) were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 3x - 5 + 9x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

13x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

13x = 70

Divide both sides by 13:

x = 5.38 (round down to 5 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks (5) and the number of shoplifters (3x - 5 = 3(5) - 5 = 10).

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 times the number of shoplifters, which is 3(10) = 30.

The number of people kicked out for other reasons is the total number of people kicked out minus the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifters, and physical violence over goods on sale:

50 - 5 - 10 - 30 = 5

So, 5 people were kicked out for other reasons.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

Erin's points = 3 * Sara's points
14 = 3 * Sara's points

Now, we can solve for Sara's points:
Sara's points = 14 / 3
Sara's points = 4.67

Now that we know Sara had 4.67 points, we can find out how many points Erin had before:
Erin's points before = Sara's points + 14
Erin's points before = 4.67 + 14
Erin's points before = 18.67

The final answer is: 18.67"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of gift and add them together.

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a 20% logo cost, we need to calculate 20% of $20.
   20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
   So, the total cost for etching the logo for all frames is $4 * 44 = $176
   The total cost for picture frames with logos is $880 + $176 = $1056

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 11 seniors.
   11 seniors * $12 per cord = $132

Now, let's add the costs together:
$1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198

The total cost for the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

Original cost = $400
Discount = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

Total cost for DIY = Original cost - Discount

The total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50.

The final answer is 50."

"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces of equipment is x.

Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000, and this is the sum of the cost of the faulty pieces and the functioning pieces.

The cost of the faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The cost of the functioning pieces is 0.6x (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

We know that the total cost is $400,000, so we can set up the equation:

0.4x + 0.6x = 400,000

Combine like terms:

1x = 400,000

Divide both sides by 1:

x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

Cost of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep.

She has 30 sheep, so half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, we need to divide the total amount of money she made ($56) by the price per apple ($4). 

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday, and she picked double the number of apples on Wednesday, she picked 2 * 14 = 28 apples on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked each day: 
14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 28 (Wednesday) = 54 apples

The final answer is 54."
"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of pairs and the number of loose socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Now, let's find the number of socks Lindsay has missed. There were originally 50 socks, and she has washed 35. 

The number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
Cookies left after brother ate some: 23 - 44 = -21

Since you can't have a negative number of cookies, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's recalculate:

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
However, since the brother ate 44 cookies, which is more than the total number of cookies, it's not possible for Rachel to have any cookies left.

The correct answer is: 0"
"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months.

First, we need to calculate the total interest. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% or 0.10, and the time is 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Karan needs to pay.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,105

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $1,105."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the number of pesos each of them has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 
Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of pesos they have together:
Axel's total: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna's total: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18 (profit)

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: 
$18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is $2."
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find out how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying tickets for both of them. Since each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, the cost of one ticket is 2 * 2 = $4. 

Since they want to ride all 9 rides, the total cost of tickets for both of them would be 9 * 4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet for both of them. The cost of one ride bracelet is $30, so the cost of two ride bracelets would be 2 * 30 = $60.

Now, let's compare the costs. The cost of buying tickets for both of them is $36, while the cost of buying two ride bracelets is $60. 

David saves $60 - $36 = $24 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets."

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts
Total ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of parts in the ratio, we add 5 + 6 = 11. 

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we divide 165 by 11 to find the value of each part: 165 ÷ 11 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of parts for Sam (6) by the value of each part (15): 6 * 15 = 90.

We do the same for Betty: 5 * 15 = 75.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount.

Original cost of Hulu and Disney Plus: $10 + $10 = $20
Discount: 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Cost after discount: $20 - $4 = $16

Total cost of streaming services: $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription:

Original cost of cable subscription: $60
Cost of streaming services: $26
Amount saved: $60 - $26 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent editing from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is equal to 1.5 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total work time:
- Writing time: 4 hours
- Recording time: 4 hours (half of 8 hours, since 4 hours is half of 8 hours)
- Editing time: 1.5 hours

Total work time = 4 + 4 + 1.5 = 9.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100:
(1.5 / 9.5) * 100 = 15.79%

The final answer is 15.79."
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs, we first need to find the total capacity of the shelving system. 

Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity is 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Double the number of books is 2 * 36 = 72. 

20 more than double the number of books is 72 + 20 = 92.

So, Wendy needs 92 books to complete her task.

92"
"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, she initially had 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has: 
She initially had 50 cards and received 17 cards from family and friends. So, she now has 50 + 17 = 67 cards.

She gave away 29 cards. So, she now has 67 - 29 = 38 cards.

The final answer is 38."
"To find out how many slices Jenny has initially, we need to add the fractions she gave to Bill and Mark. 

First, we need to find a common denominator for 3 and 4, which is 12. 

1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we add them together:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, and she eats 2 slices, we need to subtract 2 from 7/12. 

To subtract 2 from 7/12, we first convert 2 to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
2 = 24/12

Now, we subtract:
7/12 - 24/12 = -17/12

Since we can't have a negative number of slices, we need to convert -17/12 to a mixed number:
-17/12 = -1 7/12

So, Jenny has -1 7/12 slices left."
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has and then divide the result by his daily earnings.

Mark has $50 initially.
The bike costs $300.

$50 - $300 = -$250 (Mark doesn't have enough money, so he needs more)

Since Mark doesn't have enough money, we need to find out how much more he needs to save.

$300 (bike cost) - $50 (initial amount) = $250 (amount needed)

Now, we divide the amount needed by his daily earnings to find out how many days he needs to save.

$250 ÷ $10 (daily earnings) = 25 days

Mark needs 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

"To find the total calories consumed, we need to multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass and then multiply by the calories per ounce.

Number of glasses = 2
Ounces per glass = 8
Calories per ounce = 3

Total ounces = 2 * 8 = 16
Total calories = 16 * 3 = 48

John consumed 48 calories."
"To find the total number of working days in a year, we need to multiply the number of weeks worked per month by the number of weeks worked per month, and then multiply that by 12 months.

4 weeks/month * 6 days/week = 24 days/month
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Since the builder gets paid $50 per day, we multiply the total number of working days by the daily wage:

288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we need to multiply the normal recipe by 4. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the daily energy usage is:
900 watts/hour * 24 hours = 21600 watts/day

In 30 days, the total energy usage is:
21600 watts/day * 30 days = 648000 watts

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily energy usage is:
900 watts/hour * 19 hours = 17100 watts/day

The energy saved per day is:
21600 watts/day - 17100 watts/day = 4500 watts/day

In 30 days, the total energy saved is:
4500 watts/day * 30 days = 135000 watts

To convert the energy saved from watts to kilowatts, we divide by 1000:
135000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total number of stripes, we need to add the number of stripes on each zebra.

Two zebras with 17 stripes each have 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
Adding the zebra with 36 stripes, we have 34 + 36 = 70 stripes.
The zebra with half the number of stripes of the second zebra has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.
Now, we add the stripes of all zebras: 70 + 18 = 88 stripes.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 3 = 29.33.

The final answer is 29.33."
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is:
$35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Let's represent the number of cannolis as 'c'. Then, the number of corns will be 2c.

We are given that Allan has a total of 40 cannolis. So, c = 40.

Now, we know that Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

We are also given that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new total number of corns is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, we have the total number of cannolis (100) and corns (60). To find the combined total, we add them together: 100 + 60 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the steps left from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is 4,000."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book and then divide it by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Time to finish the book = Total words in the book / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the employees in May.

Number of employees in May = 40
Hours worked per week = 40
Total hours worked in May = 40 * 4 = 160 hours

Since each employee is paid $15 per hour, the total amount paid to the employees in May is:
Total amount in May = 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees remaining is:
Number of employees in June = 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30

The total hours worked in June is the same as in May, 160 hours. 
Total amount in June = 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400

Total amount paid to the employees in the two months = Total amount in May + Total amount in June
Total amount = $2400 + $2400 = $4800"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is $3."
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, we need to calculate the discount on the two packages. The discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. The total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days.

Since she eats 2 cookies per night, for 30 days, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 cookies, we need to divide 60 cookies by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we multiply 50000 by 0.05:

50000 * 0.05 = 2500 candles

Now, we need to find the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and explodes. We know that 1% of the candles are defective and explode (99% are guaranteed not to explode, so 1% are guaranteed to explode). Since 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, and 1% of the candles are defective and explode, we can assume that the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding is the product of these two probabilities:

0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005

Now, we multiply this probability by the total number of candles to find the expected number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode:

2500 * 0.0005 = 1.25

So, approximately 1.25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
Discount = 30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price.
Discounted price = Regular price - Discount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = Discounted price * 4
= $14 * 4
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact amount is unknown.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as x. Since her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples gathered by the sisters is:

30 (Joanne's tallest) + 15 (Joanne's shortest) + x (Joanne's average) + 60 (sister's tallest) + 45 (sister's shortest) = 500

Combine like terms:
105 + x = 500

Subtract 105 from both sides:
x = 395

The final answer is: 395"
"To solve this problem, we can use the information given about the number of heads and bumps.

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, the total number of bumps is the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries multiplied by 1 and 2 respectively.

We are given that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We are also given that the total number of bumps is 304. Since each camel has 2 bumps and each dromedary has 1 bump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, we calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Now, we add the distance traveled in the first 6 days:
Total distance = 800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

Since Tom wasn't traveling on the 7th day, we don't need to add anything to the total.

In the second week, Tom traveled 300 km/day for 7 days:
Distance = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distance traveled in the second week to the total distance:
Total distance = 1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4 to find Zack's locker size.

Peter's locker size = 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Now, since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is 40."
"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to subtract the elevation of Oliver's position from the elevation of Stanley's position.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the original price of the jogger jeans. 

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of its original price, which is (1/3)x. The amount saved from the tattered jeans is the rest, which is (2/3)(x + 6).

Since the total savings is $6, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)x + (2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

x + 2(x + 6) = 18

Expanding the equation, we get:

x + 2x + 12 = 18

Combine like terms:

3x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So the original price of the jogger jeans is $2. 

Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is $2 + 6 = $8.

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $8 - $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds. The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Kenny has in total. We know that he has $50 in spending cash and he also gets to keep 1/3 of the cards, which means he gets 1/3 of the money from selling the cards. 

Let's assume Kenny starts with x cards. He sells x cards for $1.5 each, so he gets 1.5x dollars from selling the cards. He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he keeps 1/3x cards. Since he has $50 in spending cash, we can set up the equation:

1.5x - (1/3)x = 50

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

1.5x - 0.33x = 50
1.17x = 50

Now, we can divide both sides by 1.17:

x = 50 / 1.17
x = 42.71

Since Kenny can't have a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

x ≈ 42

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we calculate this as:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests

These 18 guests were prepared for two hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since there were only 18 prepared for two hotdogs, we need to find out how many extra guests were there.

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

These 22 guests did not get a second hotdog because there were not enough prepared for them."

   20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

3. Calculate the final cost after the discount:
   Final cost = Total cost - Discount
   Final cost = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: 
$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the money she has from the total cost:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (money she has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To find the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. 
   Three quarters of 100 is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. 
   Twice 75 is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. 
   One-fifth of 150 is 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many gallons are in a container, we need to divide the total amount of gas (15 gallons) by the number of containers (5).

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert gallons to pints.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Now, we need to find out how many pints are in 1/4 of a container. 

1/4 of 3 gallons = 3/4 * 3 gallons = 2.25 gallons

Now, we need to convert 2.25 gallons to pints.

2.25 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 18 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 18 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he got 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his money. 

George spent 99% of $5, which is 0.99 * 5 = $4.95. 

Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, we can find out how many bags he bought by dividing the amount he spent on chips by the cost of each bag: 4.95 / 0.40 = 12.375. Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 12 bags.

Now, we know that George spent $4.95 on chips and $5 in total. So, the amount he spent on candy bars is $5 - $4.95 = $0.05. 

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar: 0.05 / 0.75 = 0.0667. Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to 0 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to first find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among 4 friends, we divide 20 by 4:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops."
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece
Total weight of the pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find the total number of people sharing the oranges, we need to add Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends. 

Total number of people = 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (their friends) = 8

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56

Now, divide the total oranges by the total number of people:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

Everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the onions, we need to multiply the weight of the onions by the price per pound.

2 pounds of onions * $2.00 per pound = $4.00

Since Antoine likes to double the amount of onions, we multiply the cost by 2.

$4.00 * 2 = $8.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00.

2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost.

$8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00

Since the soup serves 6 people, we divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then find out how much earlier she should leave.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette should leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is Area = length * width. 

So, 360 = 9 * width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads the sister with fewer beads has from the number of beads the sister with more beads has. 

Since Elizabeth has fewer beads, we subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature change due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to the oven:
The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus spends 3 hours baking, the total temperature increase is:
5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window:
The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:
2 degrees/10 minutes * 3 intervals (30 minutes / 10 minutes) = 6 degrees

Now, we subtract the temperature decrease due to the window from the temperature increase due to the oven:
15 degrees - 6 degrees = 9 degrees

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. Adding the temperature increase due to the oven and subtracting the temperature decrease due to the window, we get:
40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon.

Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
James' swim time: 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

Jon's bike time: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
James' bike time: 80 + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Jon's run time: 50 minutes
James' run time: We don't know yet.

Let's denote James' run time as x minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, we can set up the following equation:

(40 + 36 + 50) - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Combine like terms:
126 - 121 - x = 10
5 - x = 10

Subtract 5 from both sides:
-x = 5

Multiply both sides by -1:
x = 5

So, James' run time is 5 minutes.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total distance the horse ran, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay needed is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30

Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of eggs Rozanne has, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find the number of glasses. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find the number of trays. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract the points Marcy scored from the points Joey scored.

Joey's initial points: 214
Joey's points after scoring 26: 214 + 26 = 240
Marcy's points after scoring 10: 225 + 10 = 235

Now, we subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points: 240 - 235 = 5

Joey is winning by 5 points.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers at $25 each. There are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $1115 - $576
= $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and add them together.

Six packets had 8 colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had 16 colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of popcorn as P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of buying a super ticket.

The cost of a super ticket is $20, and the cost of a movie ticket is $12. The cost of a soda is $3. 

The cost of buying a super ticket is $20. 
The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:

$15 + P = $20

Subtracting $15 from both sides of the equation gives us:

P = $5

So, the regular price of popcorn is $5."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the cost of filling 20 balloons after the price increase.

Initially, the cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon was $20 more. 

So, the new cost of filling 20 balloons is $900 + (20 * 20) = $900 + $400 = $1300.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons by dividing the new cost of filling 20 balloons by 8.5 (170/20 = 8.5).

Cost of filling 170 balloons = $1300 / 8.5 = $152.94

The final answer is: $152.94"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples eaten, we need to multiply the number of apples each person eats per day by the number of days.

Marin eats 4 apples/day, and Nancy eats 4 apples/day. 
So, the total number of apples eaten per day is 4 + 4 = 8 apples.

In 30 days, they will eat 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to multiply the width, length, and height of each bed.

Volume of one bed = width * length * height
Volume of one bed = 2 * 8 * 2
Volume of one bed = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Since each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total volume / 2
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

Since each bag costs $12, the total cost of the potting soil is:
Total cost = Number of bags * cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920"
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9

Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

Now, let's add up the number of cards of all colors.
Total number of cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new ones) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
Now, the total number of fairies remaining is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12). 

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35%"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

- 2 boxes of sugar cubes: 2 * 1 = 2 pounds
- 4 bags of carrots: 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- 42 bales of hay: 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- 20 sacks of oats: 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips:
4400 / 2250 = 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns in a month, we need to calculate her earnings per week and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle. She drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles per week.

Earnings from aluminum cans per week: 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents
Earnings from plastic bottles per week: 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents
Total earnings per week: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Now, let's multiply her weekly earnings by 4 to find out her monthly earnings:
21 cents * 4 = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents per month from recycling."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. 

Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants by multiplying Frederick's plants by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6). 

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants * 1.6
Toni's plants = 10 * 1.6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's plants.

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

Basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 6 * 25 = 150 cards
Baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 5 * 40 = 200 cards

Total number of cards: 150 + 200 = 350 cards

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the remaining cards are given to her students. 
Number of cards given to students: 350 - 50 = 300 cards

Since each student received 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the total number of cards given to students by 10.
Number of students: 300 / 10 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how much Becky paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.45 = $9.
Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

To find out how much Kelly paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples she bought and subtract the discount.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 * 0.50 = $10.
Kelly received a 10% discount, which is 10% of 10 = 0.10 * 10 = $1.
So Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total: 9 - 8 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. 

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra, we can write the equation as:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x'. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total."
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to first find the total length of the remoras. Since there are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long, the total length of the remoras is 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 12 inches is equal to 1 foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we can divide the length of the remoras (1 foot) by the shark's body length (10 feet) and multiply by 100:

(1 / 10) * 100 = 10%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation. Let's say the total number of students is x.

Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We are given that (1/4)x = 20. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

(1/4)x * 4 = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let's break it down:

- Total number of kids allergic to dairy = 9
- Total number of kids allergic to peanuts = 6
- Total number of kids allergic to both = 3

To find the total number of kids allergic to at least one of the two, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, then subtract the number of kids allergic to both (to avoid double-counting):

9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything:

32 (total kids) - 12 (kids allergic to at least one) = 20

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. 
4 * 64 = 256 inches

The next layer consists of 3 girls, each standing on top of the 4 below them. 
Since the 4 girls are 64"" tall, the 3 girls in this layer will be 64 + 64 + 64 = 192 inches tall.

The next layer consists of 2 girls, each standing on top of the 3 below them. 
Since the 3 girls are 192"" tall, the 2 girls in this layer will be 192 + 192 = 384 inches tall.

The shortest girl is 60"" tall, so we don't need to add anything to the total height.

Now, let's add the heights of all the layers together:
256 + 192 + 384 + 60 = 892 inches

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards.

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards.

Now, let's add the yards used by both of them: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

The total yards of yarn used is 273."
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the gifts for each group of friends.

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 2 x 5 = 10.

For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, the total number of gifts is 3 x 2 = 6.

Adding the gifts for both groups, we get 10 + 6 = 16.

Then, Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26.

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

The length of the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
2. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
3. She paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.
4. The total amount she paid is $7.
5. We know that the cost of the grape gum and the green apple gum together is $2 + $1 = $3.
6. To find the cost of the strawberry gum, we subtract the cost of the grape and green apple gum from the total amount paid: $7 - $3 = $4.
7. Since Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, we divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pack: $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy 8 2 x 8 pieces of wood, as they provide the most sticks per dollar. 

8 2 x 8 pieces of wood will give him 8 * 400 = 3200 sticks.

8 2 x 4 pieces of wood will give him 8 * 200 = 1600 sticks.

Since 8 2 x 8 pieces of wood will give him more sticks, he should buy 8 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

The total cost of 8 2 x 8 pieces of wood is 8 * $6 = $48.

Since Frederick only has $24, he cannot afford 8 2 x 8 pieces of wood. 

He can afford 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood, which will give him 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

The total cost of 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood is 4 * $6 = $24.

He can afford 4 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

The answer is 1600."
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the cost of each pair of snowshoes. 

Number of dogs: 6
Cost per pair of snowshoes: $12.00

Total cost = 6 * $12.00
Total cost = $72.00

The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00."
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep in each location and then add them together.

The farm has 30 cows. 
The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add the total number of animals in the farm and zoo:
30 (farm cows) + 60 (zoo cows) + 10 (farm sheep) + 20 (zoo sheep) = 120

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 120."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4, since Rose bought 4 times the number of each item Sophia bought.

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

3 + 1 = 4"
"To find the number of days Andy has to lose 30 lbs, we need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories to lose 30 lbs. 

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 
3500 calories / 211 days ≈ 16.6 calories per day

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 16.6 calories per day to reach his goal."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns:
30 * 7 = $210

He spent $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned:
210 - 100 = $110

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer.
She will run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km.
So, the total distance she will run is 8 * 0.25 = 2 km.

Now, multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer: 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3x
= 3(30,000)
= 90,000

The house cost $90,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Josh made first. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies by dividing Suzanne's cookies by 4.

Suzanne made 36 cookies, so Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we multiply Josh's cookies by 2.

Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Ali has 4 $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40.
Ali has 6 $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.

The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80.

The remaining amount of money Ali has is $160 - $80 = $80.

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. To find 3/5 of $80, we multiply $80 by 3/5, which is $80 * 3/5 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the time taken by Rob from hours to minutes. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time taken by Rob. 

Double the time taken by Rob is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.

Adding 40 minutes to this, we get 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle the house.

"To find the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of items for the 3 grandchildren and multiply the number of skeins required for each item.

For a hat: 3 grandchildren * 2 skeins = 6 skeins
For a scarf: 3 grandchildren * 4 skeins = 12 skeins
For a sweater: 3 grandchildren * 12 skeins = 36 skeins
For a pair of mittens: 3 grandchildren * 1 pair = 3 pairs, and since each pair requires 1 skein, 3 pairs require 3 skeins
For a pair of socks: 3 grandchildren * 2 pairs = 6 pairs, and since each pair requires 2 skeins, 6 pairs require 12 skeins

Now, let's add up the total number of skeins needed:

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each person can pick and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person paints the house. 

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate = 1/2 house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day

Now, we need to find out how many people are painting the house. We are given that 5 people are painting the house.

To find the combined rate of 5 people, we multiply the individual rate by 5:

Combined rate = (1/10 house per day) * 5 = 1/2 house per day

Since the combined rate is 1/2 house per day, it will take 5 people 1 day to paint a whole house.

Therefore, it will take 5 people 1 day to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chairs Ophelia has, then find the number of chairs Jenna has, and finally add the number of sofas for both.

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and they have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has:

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as x. 
Since they have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2. 
We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation: 
x - 2 = 20
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has. 
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 66 chairs. 
The total number of sofas and chairs is 20 + 22 + 66 = 108.

The final answer is: 108"
"To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid.

Let's denote the number of CDs as 'x'. The cost of the CD is $4, and the total amount paid is $48.

We can set up the equation: 
4x + cost of headphone set = 48

Since we don't know the cost of the headphone set, let's denote it as 'y'. The equation becomes:
4x + y = 48

We know that Tom bought the CD, so the cost of the CD is $4. Let's assume the cost of the headphone set is 'y'. We can rewrite the equation as:
4x + y = 48
4x + 20 = 48 (assuming the cost of the headphone set is $20)

Now, let's solve for 'x':
4x = 48 - 20
4x = 28
x = 28/4
x = 7

So, Tom bought 7 CDs.

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphone set:
If he hadn't bought the headphone set, the total amount he paid would be $48 - $20 = $28.
We can divide the total amount by the cost of the CD to find out how many CDs he could have bought:
28 ÷ 4 = 7

However, this is the same number of CDs Tom bought. This is because the cost of the headphone set is $20, which is the same as the cost of 5 CDs. So, if Tom hadn't bought the headphone set, he could have bought 7 - 5 = 2 more CDs.

The final answer is 2."

3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be 27, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22.

In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age. So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will be 2 * 22 + 5 = 49.

Since Jame's cousin's age in 8 years is 49, Jame's current age is 49 - 8 = 41.

Now, we know Jame's current age is 22, and his cousin's current age is 41. To find the difference in their ages, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age: 41 - 22 = 19.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can subtract $400 from the cost of the computer to find the cost of the printer.

Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer from the total cost to find the cost of the two monitors.

Cost of two monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer
Cost of two monitors = $2,400 - $1,100
Cost of two monitors = $1,300

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of two monitors by 2.

Cost of one monitor = Cost of two monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,300 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $650

"To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we need to first find the total number of seashells brought by the boys and then calculate the number of seashells brought by the girls.

The boys brought 60 seashells each, and there are 20 boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 20 = 1200.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60.

First, calculate 4 times the number of seashells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Now, add the number of seashells brought by the boys to this result: 60 + 240 = 300.

Since there are 10 girls, we can divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find the number of seashells brought by each girl: 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."

Initially, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He then triples the amount he has left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2x dollars per day in the second half.

The total number of days in April is 30. The first half of the month has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in the first half is 15x, and the total amount he needs to save in the second half is 15(2x) = 30x.

Since Elvis has a monthly target of $1125, we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

So Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2x = 2(25) = $50 per day in the second half.

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars:

4x = 4(20) = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work. 
Distance to work = 3 miles
Distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
Total miles walked = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so 2 * 26 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families notified in each round and then add them up.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 new families are notified.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 new families are notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 new families are notified.

Now, let's add up the total number of families notified in each round:
3 (first round) + 9 (second round) + 27 (third round) + 81 (fourth round) = 120

Therefore, a total of 120 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first find the number of toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys. 

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. 

Jonathan currently has 402 - 2 = 400 toys.

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of all items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost, which is 0.10 * $20 = $2

The final cost after the discount is $20 - $2 = $18

The final answer is: $18"

Carly gets $17 back as change."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

Commission for sales up to $1000: 
30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

Additional commission for sales over $1000: 
10% of $1500 (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission earned by Antonella = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. 

He has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Since he wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, he will need 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Bill will need 92 additional bottles of water to have enough for his guests."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a hot day and a cold day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3 * 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2 * 16 = 32 minutes
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 * 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time between a hot day and a cold day, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"

John earns $2 per hour, works 5 hours a day, and works 4 days a week. 
So, his weekly earnings are: 
$2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80. 
To do this, we divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40). 
$80 / $40 = 2 weeks

"To find the total number of holes, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with four holes. The total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

Now, we add the total number of holes in both types of buttons: 14 + 56 = 70.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size: 12 * 1/4 = 12 * 0.25 = 3 cubic inches

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to know how many cups Octavia drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, we can calculate the amount Octavia drinks as follows:

Daily recommended cups / 2 = Octavia's daily cups
Daily recommended cups / 2 = 4 cups
Octavia's daily cups = 4 cups / 2
Octavia's daily cups = 2 cups

Now, we can calculate Juan's daily cups:
Juan's daily cups = 10 * Octavia's daily cups
Juan's daily cups = 10 * 2 cups
Juan's daily cups = 20 cups

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we can calculate the reduction as follows:
Juan's reduction = Juan's daily cups - Daily recommended cups
Juan's reduction = 20 cups - 4 cups
Juan's reduction = 16 cups

The final answer is 16."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

Number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark's weight: 150 pounds
Susan's weight: 150 - 20 = 130 pounds
Bob's weight: 2 * 130 = 260 pounds

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angle of the sun's position after 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees above the ground. Since the sun is moving upward at 5 degrees per hour, we multiply the time by the rate of movement to find the change in angle: 
5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we add the change in angle to the initial angle to find the final angle of the sun:
32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

The final angle of the sun from the ground is 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs. Since the younger son is 8 years old, he will need 8 / 5 = 1.6 packs of candles. However, since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, James will need to buy 2 packs of candles (1 full pack and 1 partial pack, but since you can't buy a partial pack, he will buy 2 full packs).

Since each pack costs $3, James will spend 2 * $3 = $6 on candles.

The final answer is $6."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 to get the number of 1.5-minute intervals, which is 70. Then, we multiply 70 by 2 to get the total number of pages she read in the first week, which is 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week (140) and the pages read in the second week (100). The total number of pages she read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. 
1/3 of 12 is 4.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. 
1/4 of 12 is 3.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches.
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the problem into parts.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we need to use the information given.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Anna as A, the number of goals scored by Mark as M, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: R = M + 20.

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation: R = A + 45.

We are also given that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can write: R = 80.

Now we can substitute R = 80 into the first equation: 80 = M + 20.

Solving for M, we get: M = 80 - 20 = 60.

Now we can substitute R = 80 into the second equation: 80 = A + 45.

Solving for A, we get: A = 80 - 45 = 35.

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers: 
Total goals = A + M + R = 35 + 60 + 80 = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much Mitchell made, we need to multiply the number of lemonades he sold by the price of each lemonade. 

Number of lemonades sold by Mitchell = 21
Price of each lemonade = $4

Total amount Mitchell made = 21 * 4 = $84

Now, let's compare this to what Liam made. Liam made $63.

To find the difference, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made.

Difference = Total amount Mitchell made - Total amount Liam made
= $84 - $63

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"To find out how much Peter spent on wooden action figures, we need to calculate the total amount spent on these figures. Since he spent $5 each for 3 days (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday), the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

$5 * 3 = $15

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount of money Peter has after spending $15 on wooden action figures:

$70 - $15 = $55

Since Peter has $55 left and he will spend an equal amount each day for the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), we can divide the remaining amount by 4 to find out how much he will spend each day:

$55 / 4 = $13.75

Now, let's calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy with $13.75:

$13.75 / $2 = 6.875

Since we can't buy a fraction of an action figure, we'll round down to 6 plastic action figures.

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week:

6 (wooden action figures) + 6 (plastic action figures) = 12

The final answer is 12."

The cost of the 4 broken vases is 4 * $12 = $48.

Now, let's add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops per week and then multiply it by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month).

First, let's calculate the total number of roses supplied per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total number of roses supplied per week by 4:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate how many roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses he supplies per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue, total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 1
Cost of bread = Cost of bread per loaf * Number of loaves
Cost of bread = $3.00 * 1
Cost of bread = $3.00

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00"
"To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first find out how many crayons she has in total. 

She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons. 
3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Since she melts 8 crayons together to make one muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffins she can make.

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, we can find the total number of utensils by adding the cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend. 
Total cups = Judy's cups + friend's cups = 12 + 40 = 52
Total dishes = Judy's dishes + friend's dishes = 24 + 44 = 68

Total utensils = Total cups + Total dishes = 52 + 68 = 120"
"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discount amount is:
$100.00 * 10% = $10.00
So, the discounted price of 1 box is:
$100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain:
90 pairs * 2 = 180 pairs

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:
$180.00 / 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair

"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so calories burned from aerobics = 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.
Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so calories burned from running = 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned, then multiply that by 100 ml.

200-calorie units = total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8 units.
Total ml of water needed = 8 units * 100 ml/unit = 800 ml.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total number of jelly beans is 4500.
- The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
- The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B (since it's 1% fewer), and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B (since it's 1% more).

We know that the sum of the three types of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

Red jelly beans = 0.99B = 0.99(1500) = 1485

And the number of green jelly beans:

Green jelly beans = 1.01B = 1.01(1500) = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans:

Difference = Green jelly beans - Red jelly beans = 1509 - 1485 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three numbers together and divide by 3.

Initial speed: 47 WPM
Increased speed: 52 WPM
New speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

Now, let's add the three speeds together: 
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3:
156 / 3 = 52

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

For Cheerios: 
Weight lost per week = 1.25 pounds
Total weight lost in 5 weeks = 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds

For Donuts:
Weight gained per week = 1.75 pounds
Total weight gained in 5 weeks = 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in weight:
Difference in weight = Total weight gained - Total weight lost
= 8.75 - 6.25

"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, the number of friends' friends, the number of friends she invited, and the number of spouses.

1. Alex invited 100 people.
2. Each invited person said they will invite 2 friends, so the number of friends invited is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex invited 10 friends, and each of them will bring their spouse, so the number of spouses is 10 * 1 = 10.

Now, we add up all the people: 
- Alex (1) + invited people (100) + friends' friends (200) + invited friends (10) + spouses (10) = 321

The total number of people attending the event is 321.

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the daily protein intake and then multiply it by 7.

Daily protein intake = 3 grams (protein per cup) * 200 grams (mushrooms eaten per day) = 600 grams

Weekly protein intake = 600 grams (daily protein intake) * 7 days = 4200 grams

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

$3900"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

Colby has 8 quarters, which is 8 * $0.25 = $2.00
He also has 6 dimes, which is 6 * $0.10 = $0.60
Additionally, he has 14 nickels, which is 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
Lastly, he has 15 pennies, which is 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many Colby can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

Now, we add this to the original weight to find the weight Jamaal initially increased to:
8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

However, Jamaal decides to use a weight two pounds lighter than that. So, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds:
12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

The final weight Jamaal uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1:

"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find the total number of rotations per year, we need to multiply the number of rotations per mile by the number of miles driven per year.

First, we find the number of rotations per year:
725 rotations/mile * 400 miles/year = 290,000 rotations/year

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 290,000 rotations/year = 36.55 years

The tire needs to be replaced in approximately 36.55 years."
"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings per pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 = $0.20 per washing.

Cost per pump = $0.20 / 60 = $0.00333 per pump.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100. 

Cost per pump = $0.00333 * 100 = 0.33 cents per pump.

The final answer is 0.33."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The discount is 30% of the total price of the items. The total price of the items is $25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60. 

The discount is 30% of $60, which is 0.3 * $60 = $18. 

The total cost of the outfit after the discount is $60 - $18 = $42. 

Now, we need to add the sales tax. The sales tax is not specified, but we can assume it's 8% (a common sales tax rate). 

The sales tax is 8% of $42, which is 0.08 * $42 = $3.36. 

The total cost of the outfit is $42 + $3.36 = $45.36. 

Joe started with $50, so he will have $50 - $45.36 = $4.64 left after the purchase."
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days. 
4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we multiply 28 dozen by 1/4 pound:
28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

= 4/5 * $2000
= $1600

Now, we can find the price of the silver jewel:
Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels:
Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we can't have a negative speed, we need to consider the direction. In this case, we'll assume Bob is driving away from Tom, so we'll use the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first. 

Since Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum cost allowed.

The total cost of the classes is $60. Since there are 10 classes, the maximum cost allowed is $10 per class. 

To find the maximum total cost allowed, we multiply the maximum cost per class by the number of classes: 
$10 * 10 = $100

Since the total cost of the classes is $60, which is less than the maximum allowed cost of $100, Manny's parents will sign him up for the 10 classes.

However, the question asks how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again. Since he has already signed up for 10 classes, he can miss 0 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel.

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both Julie and Jewel is 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many miles Reggie ran. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance. 

Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 17 miles

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50

Now, let's add the costs together: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the hole.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time it will take to dig the hole.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

The cost of the leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The cost of the running boards is $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The cost of the upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add the cost of each feature to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to calculate the raise first. 

5% of $20000 is 0.05 * 20000 = $1000. 

So, his new monthly salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $21000 / 2 = $10500.

Now, let's calculate his total monthly income: $21000 + $10500 = $31500.

To find his yearly income, we multiply his monthly income by 12: $31500 * 12 = $378000.

The final answer is: $378000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 10 suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

The cost of 10 dress pants is 10 * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1500.

The cost of 3 dress shirts per suit is 3 * 10 * $60 = $1800.

Now, let's add the costs together: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The total cost of everything is $10800."
"To find the total number of articles published, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website in February and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Since there are three bags, the total amount of flour is 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms.

"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, let's add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley:
54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil: 
Distance of soil = 24 feet
Rate of digging through soil = 4 feet/hour
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay:
Distance of clay = 8 feet
Rate of digging through clay = 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time = 4 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."
"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

1. Howie needs 2 cupcakes for himself.
2. He needs 2 cupcakes for his teacher.
3. He needs 2 cupcakes for each of his 25 classmates, so 25 x 2 = 50 cupcakes.

Now, let's add up the total number of cupcakes: 
2 (for himself) + 2 (for his teacher) + 50 (for his classmates) = 54 cupcakes.

Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the initial number of likes, we know that 3 weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number. Let's call the initial number of likes 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 
70x = 2000 + x

Subtract x from both sides: 
69x = 2000

Divide both sides by 69: 
x = 2000 / 69
x = 28.85 (round down to 29 since you can't have a fraction of a like)

Now, we know the initial number of likes was 29. 

The total number of likes now is the initial number of likes plus the 20000 new likes: 
29 + 20000 = 20229

The final answer is: 20229"
"To find the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the cost of the pomegranates on each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, the price per pomegranate was $30, and there was a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost of 20 pomegranates at $30 each is:
20 * $30 = $600
The 10% discount is:
$600 * 0.10 = $60
The final cost on Wednesday is:
$600 - $60 = $540

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and the final price paid on Tuesday ($398) is less than the final price paid on Wednesday ($540), the correct answer is -$142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate her sales for each month.

Let's denote the total sales of green hats as G. Since her sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, her sales from red hats can be represented as G/2.

We know that her sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

G/2 = 400

To find G, we multiply both sides by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

So, her sales from green hats were $800.

Now, let's calculate her total sales for the first month:

Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month:

Sales in the second month = 3/4 * 1200
= 900

Now, let's calculate her total sales for two months:

Total sales for two months = Total sales for the first month + Sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: 2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to subtract the amount she has in her bank account from her expected wage.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank balance: $420

Subtract the current bank balance from the expected wage:
$300 - $420 = -$120

Since the result is negative, it means that Sally's bank account was overdrawn by $120. This means that $120 was withheld from her wage."
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg for 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total deviled egg halves: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs).

Total eggs: 24
Number of eggs in a dozen: 12

Total dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages per day = 10

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we subtract the number of days it will take him to finish the book from the deadline.

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the monthly rent, and the monthly fuel cost, then add them together.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (total monthly cost) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cooking time for pork and beans.

Since it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three items: 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
1/5 pound almonds = 1/5 * $10 = $2
1/3 pound walnuts = 1/3 * $15 = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads is s + g = 20.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs is 4s + 2g = 70.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. 

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to get 2s + 2g = 40.

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get 2s = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = 15.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral.

We know that Christina had 12 good days initially, 8 good days in the next 3 days, and 8 good days in the first 8 days. So, the total number of good days is 12 + 8 + 8 = 28.

However, we also know that the total number of days in the month is 30. Since 3 days were good, neutral, and good, we can subtract these 3 days from the total number of days to find the number of neutral days: 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, we can subtract the total number of good days (28) and neutral days (27) from the total number of days (30) to find the number of bad days: 30 - 28 - 27 = -5. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of days.

Let's re-evaluate the information. We know that Christina had 12 good days initially, 8 good days in the next 3 days, and 8 good days in the first 8 days. So, the total number of good days is 12 + 8 + 8 = 28. We also know that the total number of days in the month is 30.

Since 28 good days have already been recorded, and there are 3 more good days to be recorded, we can subtract 28 + 3 = 31 from the total number of days. However, this exceeds the total number of days in the month. 

Let's re-examine the information. We know that Christina had 12 good days initially, 8 good days in the next 3 days, and 8 good days in the first 8 days. So, the total number of good days is 12 + 8 + 8 = 28. We also know that the total number of days in the month is 30.

Since 28 good days have already been recorded, and there are 3 more good days to be recorded, we can subtract 28 from the total number of days: 30 - 28 = 2. This means that there are 2 good days left in the month.

The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to isolate x. To do this, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the initial height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches:

240 inches + 30 inches/day = 600 inches

Subtract 240 from both sides of the equation:

30 inches/day = 360 inches

Now, divide both sides by 30 inches/day:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog needs 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs is 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs.
3. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 12 toys initially.
4. When James came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is now 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. However, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
6. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 21 toys.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5.

Dylan's investment = 1200 * (2/5) = 480

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount.

Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply 720 by 2/3 to find Frances' investment.

Frances' investment = 720 * (2/3) = 480

4. Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment.

Skyler's investment = 720 - 480 = 240

So, Skyler's investment was $240."
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they have already collected. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to subtract the signatures they already have from their goal. 
100 - 64 = 36 signatures

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns, we need to first find out how much Lorie earns in two days. 

Lorie earns $10 per hour and works for 2 days, so she earns 10 * 2 = $20 in 2 days.

Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, Karen earns 2 * 20 = $40 in 2 days.

Karen works 3 hours per day, so in 2 days, she works 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

To find out how much Karen earns in 6 hours, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: 40 * 6 = $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns.

We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 

First, we find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns: 
6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 1/6

Now, we can use this ratio to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:
96 potatoes / 6 potatoes = 16

So, 16 hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

16"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The answer is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally add up the number of cookies each of them has.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can set up an equation to find out how many cookies Max has:

Katarina's cookies = Max's cookies - 5
68 = Max's cookies - 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has:

Max's cookies = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12
73 = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Now that we know the number of cookies each of them has, we can add up the number of cookies they have:

Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies = 68 + 73 + 61
= 202

The total number of cookies they have is 202."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x. 

Since the final length is 140cm and it's 50% longer than the original length, we can set up the equation:

x + 0.5x = 140

Combine like terms:

1.5x = 140

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 140 / 1.5
x = 93.33

So, the original length of the dress was approximately 93.33cm.

The final answer is: 93.33"
"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in each mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in turtle mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent from the total time available.

Total time available = 30 minutes
Time spent so far = 6 minutes (to the corner) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes

Time left = Total time available - Time spent so far
Time left = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left = 11 minutes

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we need to multiply the number of cookies Greta bakes by 2. 

Celinda bakes 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.

Now, let's add the number of cookies Greta and Celinda baked: 
30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 cookies while cooling, so we subtract 10 from the total:
90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The answer is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are two sets: one set of twins and one set of triplets.
- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin is x + 7.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older twin is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to the nearest whole number for the twin's age, as the question doesn't specify if the ages are exact or rounded. 

One of the twins is 14 years old."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner. 

First, we need to convert 3 hours into minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, let's add up the time John has for homework:
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time:
180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops, we multiply the cost of one lollipop by 10: 
10 * $0.40 = $4.00

We already know the cost of 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 10 candies, we multiply the cost of 4 candies by 2.5 (since 10 is 2.5 times 4):
$3.20 * 2.5 = $8.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
$4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year. 

Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, in 1 year he saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins.

Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, we need to find 2/5 of 20 and add it to 20. 
2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
So Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

In 1 year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

Now, we need to find the total number of coins they have saved after 10 years. 
Rong has saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
Neil has saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have saved after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2: 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. We can set up the equation: 
60% of x = 0.6x
Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can also say that the total bill is 100% - 60% = 40% of the total bill is the cost of the vaccines. 
So, 40% of x = $40
To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.4: 
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find the amount John leaves with by subtracting the total bill from the amount he brought: 
$125 - $100 = $25

25"
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The total price for the crate of fruit is $32."

Since there are already 8 high chairs, Mia needs 48 - 8 = 40 more chairs.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to calculate 20% of the total number of bucks.

First, we find the number of bucks: 
50% of 50 = 0.5 * 50 = 25 bucks

Then, we find 20% of the bucks:
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks."
"To find the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points collected by each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by all the students:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Tom: 35
Marta: 105
Total points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

"To find the total number of great grand-babies, we need to calculate the number of children of each generation and multiply them together.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"To find out how much Greta puts into her retirement account, we need to calculate 50% of her paycheck.

50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200

Now, we subtract the amount she put into her retirement account from her original paycheck.

$2400 - $1200 = $1200

Next, we need to find out how much she uses for her car payment, which is 20% of her paycheck.

20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, we subtract the amount she used for her car payment from the remaining amount.

$1200 - $480 = $720

So, Greta has $720 left to spend.

$720"
"To find the number of pencils in the box, we need to subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity of the box. 

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the city:
15 boxes of 20 fireworks each = 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
40% of 300 = 0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard:
3 boxes of 5 fireworks each = 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and her backyard:
120 fireworks (from the city) + 15 fireworks (from her backyard) = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total number of people, we need to add Aiden and his 12 friends to the 7 more friends they meet up with. 

Total number of people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends
Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7
Total number of people = 20

Since each seat can hold 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks, we need to find the total number of drinks and snacks needed. 

Total number of drinks = 2 * Total number of people
Total number of drinks = 2 * 20
Total number of drinks = 40

Total number of snacks = 3 * Total number of people
Total number of snacks = 3 * 20
Total number of snacks = 60

Since each drink and snack costs $2, we can find the total cost of drinks and snacks by multiplying the total number of drinks and snacks by the cost of each item.

Total cost of drinks = Total number of drinks * Cost per drink
Total cost of drinks = 40 * $2
Total cost of drinks = $80

Total cost of snacks = Total number of snacks * Cost per snack
Total cost of snacks = 60 * $2
Total cost of snacks = $120

Total cost of drinks and snacks = Total cost of drinks + Total cost of snacks

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Let's denote the weight that Gissela's truck can carry as G. 
2. Gordy's truck can carry G + 800 pounds of gravel.
3. The total weight that the three trucks can carry together is G + (G + 800) + x, where x is the weight that Gary's truck can carry.
4. We know that the total weight that the three trucks can carry together is 11,600 pounds. So, we can set up the equation: G + (G + 800) + x = 11,600.
5. We also know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. So, we can substitute G = 4,000 into the equation: 4,000 + (4,000 + 800) + x = 11,600.
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 8,000 + x = 11,600.
7. Subtracting 8,000 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 3,600.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 3,600 pounds of gravel.

"To find the total number of dumplings, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is also 50.

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5. 

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we multiply 3/5 by $100 to find his initial amount: 
(3/5) * 100 = $60

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract this from his initial amount:
$60 - $10 = $50

Gerald had $50 left.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 feet/second / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do this, we multiply the speed of the turtle by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to subtract the amount already raised from the goal and then divide by the hourly amount raised.

Amount already raised: $2100
Goal: $6300
Amount left to raise: $6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount left to raise by the hourly amount raised.

Hourly amount raised: $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, divide the amount left to raise by the hourly amount raised:
$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

The firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 40%. 

To find the correct answer, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. 

Let's assume the total percentage of the river's water used by the city is x. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can set up the equation:

80% of x = 40%

To solve for x, we can convert the percentages to decimals and divide both sides by 0.8:

0.8x = 0.4

x = 0.4 / 0.8
x = 0.5

Now that we know the total percentage of the river's water used by the city, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 100%:

100% - 80% = 20%

So, 20% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is: 20%"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 2 x 7 = 14 days.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to find the rate of production for each type of ice cream and then add them together.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. So, the rate of production is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. So, the rate of production is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The total cost of the mini quiches is 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
The total cost of the blueberry muffins is 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost of all the items is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00, which is 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is $45.00."

"To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the number of tiles needed, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 square feet.

Two thirds of 36 can be calculated as (2/3) * 36 = 24.

James saved $10 by picking blueberries himself."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to find the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

3. Finally, we find the number of people who accept the position:
   6 * (1/3) = 6 * 0.33 = 2 people

The final answer is 2."
"To find the total amount of rice Goldy gave away, we need to calculate the number of sacks she gave away and multiply it by the weight of each sack.

She gave away 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack weighs 25 kilograms, the total weight of rice given away is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

The final answer is 175."
"To find the difference in the number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week, we need to subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week.

This week: 3 boxes of Coco Crunch + 5 boxes of Fruit Loops = 8 boxes
Last week: 4 boxes

8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4

Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps per minute for each scenario and then multiply by the number of minutes.

Scenario 1: Both hands at her sides
- Right foot: 300 taps/minute
- Left foot: 250 taps/minute
- Combined taps/minute: 300 + 250 = 550 taps/minute

Scenario 2: Arms raised
- Right foot: 200 taps/minute
- Left foot: 200 taps/minute
- Combined taps/minute: 200 + 200 = 400 taps/minute

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total, with her arms raised for 2 minutes. 
- Time with arms raised: 2 minutes
- Time with arms down: 5 - 2 = 3 minutes

Total taps with arms raised: 2 * 400 = 800 taps
Total taps with arms down: 3 * 550 = 1650 taps

Total taps: 800 + 1650 = 2450 taps

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and then subtract the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

The cost of the damage to the car is $450. The cost of the fine is $120. The cost of the asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75.

Total cost of fixing the pothole = $450 (damage) + $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $645

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the cost of the damage to find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself.

Money saved = $450 (damage) - $645 (total cost) = -$195

Since the result is negative, it means that Ron will actually lose $195 by fixing the pothole himself.

The final answer is: -$195"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs sent for repair:
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
Total chairs sent for repair: 20 + 13 = 33

Now, let's subtract the total chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Total chairs: 170 + 23 = 193
- Total chairs sent for repair: 33
- Total chairs left: 193 - 33 = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people, they ate 3 x 2/3 = 2 pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so they ate 2 x 12 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 x ¾ = 1 ½ pizzas. Since 1 ½ pizzas is equivalent to 1 whole pizza and 6 slices, they ate 1 x 12 + 6 = 18 slices.

Now, let's subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 24 - 18 = 18 slices.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

Time taken by the cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages.

Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9, we get: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

For students' cars: 
Number of students' cars = 64
Number of windows per car = 4
Total windows smashed for students' cars = 64 * 4 = 256

For teachers' cars:
Number of teachers' cars = 32
Number of windows per car = 2
Total windows smashed for teachers' cars = 32 * 2 = 64

Total windows smashed = 256 (students) + 64 (teachers) = 320

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of people who had voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by midday and then add the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.

By midday, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people

The remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people

The number of people who had voted by 16:00 is 2000 (voted by midday) + 2000 (voted between midday and 16:00) = 4000 people

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 5000 - 4000 = 1000 people."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4 pieces).

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To find out how many smores the kids will eat, multiply the number of kids by the number of smores each kid wants: 
9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores

To find out how many smores the adults will eat, multiply the number of adults by the number of smores each adult wants:
6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Now, add the total number of smores the kids and adults will eat:
18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, you will need 3 boxes of graham crackers."
"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know Dora's age is 15 years.
2. Since Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can calculate his age as follows:
   Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
   Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
   Father's age = 30 + 8
   Father's age = 38

3. Now, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so we can calculate her age as follows:
   Mother's age = Father's age - 4
   Mother's age = 38 - 4
   Mother's age = 34

4. Now, we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
   Dora's age = 15
   Father's age = 38
   Mother's age = 34

5. To find the total combined age, we add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
   Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
   Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
   Total combined age = 87

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together.

The math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.
The French book weighs 4 pounds.
The English book weighs 3 pounds.
The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. So, candidate C got 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many apples Beck has, we need to subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount of apples. 

Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. 
So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. 
Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount.
90 - 87 = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has. 

Since Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can set up the equation:

2 * Steven's books = 20

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides by 2:

Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we add 6 to Steven's books:

Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now that we know both Clara and Alice's books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

Clara's books - Alice's books = 20 - 16
Clara's books - Alice's books = 4

"To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. 
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Cost of 10-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a gallon jar
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = Number of jars * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
Total amount spent = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars

"To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to first find the number of students who like to play music. 

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of students is 50, and 10 + 5 = 15 students like to bake or play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - 15 = 35.

Since we know that 10 students like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2.

80 / 2 = 40 students in each class.

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is 40% in decimal form).

40 * 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have.

Since Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2.

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, we can find out how many marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Now, we can find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their marbles.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

"To find the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups. 

First, we need to find the number of students per group. 
Total students = 54
Number of groups = 6
Students per group = Total students / Number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 6
Students per group = 9

However, the question states that 12 groups are required. To find the number of students per group in this case, we divide the total number of students by the required number of groups.
Students per group = Total students / Required number of groups
Students per group = 54 / 12
Students per group = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 12, which is 12. We can then divide the total number of students by the LCM to find the number of groups.
Number of groups = Total students / LCM
Number of groups = 54 / 12
Number of groups = 4.5

However, we can't have a fraction of a group. We need to find the closest multiple of 6 that is greater than or equal to 54. The closest multiple of 6 is 54 itself, which can be divided into 6 groups of 9 students. 

Since 54 students are already divided into 6 groups, we need to find the difference between the required number of groups and the actual number of groups.
Number of groups needed = Required number of groups - Actual number of groups
Number of groups needed = 12 - 6
Number of groups needed = 6

The answer is 6."
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 2 weeks is 10 days. So, the total number of weekdays in 2 weeks is 5 * 10 = 50 days.

During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day, so the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 2 weeks is 60 * 50 = 3000.

There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 2 weeks is 4 days. So, the total number of weekend days in 2 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8 days.

During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day, so the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 2 weeks is 100 * 8 = 800.

Now, we add the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends to get the total number of chairs rented in 2 weeks: 3000 + 800 = 3800.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 3800 chairs in two 4-week months."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the information that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. 

Since the total number of council members is 33, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation would be 2x (twice the number of votes against it). 

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts needed:
11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. 
60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation: 
1/3 * total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:
total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's set up an equation for the total number of puppies:
2/3 * total puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:
total puppies = 18 * 3/2
total puppies = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

Since the camera costs $200, we subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera to find out how much more he needs:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first find out how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the total, we can calculate it as follows:
Total cases = 250
Cases needed by the first house = 1/2 * 250 = 125

Now, we know the third house needs double the amount of the first house. 
Cases needed by the third house = 2 * 125 = 250

So, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

Final answer: 250"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas and add it to 200.

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, add 90 to 200 to find the number of pears: 200 + 90 = 290

Since George has 200 bananas and 290 pears, the total number of fruits George has is 200 + 290 = 490.

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially.

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20 = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars Marissa bought.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice. Since 1 liter requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

The cost of 20 kilograms of oranges is 20 * $3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find the total number of books read, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read.

Ezra read 300 books initially, then he read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

Now, we divide 450 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read: 450 / 2 = 225.

Now, we add the number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed: 450 (Ezra) + 225 (Ahmed) = 675.

The final answer is: 675"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * $15 per class = $60
Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. 
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * $15 per class = $30
Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day. 
$30 + $5 = $35

Now, let's add her earnings for both days:
$65 + $35 = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold to find the difference:
20 (vanilla) - 16 (fruity) = 4

The perfume company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents."
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he earns from selling eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he earns from eggplants is:
20 * 3 = 60

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We also know that he earns $60 from eggplants. To find out how much he needs to earn from corn, we subtract the amount he earns from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make:
135 - 60 = 75

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we can divide the amount he needs to earn from corn by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear:
75 / 25 = 3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and back.

Time to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum to find the total time.

Total time = Time to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 8 hours

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total number of wheels needed: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels available in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

The number of wheels left will be 276."
"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800."
"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:
Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Step 3: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, the total cost is:
Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost per movie
= 200 * 6
= 1200

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, the total cost is:
Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per movie
= 160 * 5
= 800

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the normal movies.
Since the remaining movies are normal movies, we can calculate the number of normal movies as follows:
Number of normal movies = Remaining movies - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240
The cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost per movie
= 240 * 10
= 2400

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= 1200 + 800 + 2400
= 4400

The final answer is: 4400"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

Cost of peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
Cost of plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Cost of apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Total cost: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The total amount Winston spent on fruit is $38.00."
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we can calculate their driving speed as follows:
Driving speed = 50 mph
Half of their driving speed = 50 / 2 = 25 mph
Hiking speed = 25 - 5 = 20 mph

Now, we know that they hiked for 1.5 hours. To find the distance, we can multiply their hiking speed by the time:
Distance = Hiking speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score = 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 + 0 = 8 enemies.
- She collects 8 - 3 = 5 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score = 8 * 10 (for enemies) + 5 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 80 + 25 + 900 = 1005

The difference between their scores is 1005 - 820 = 185.

The final answer is 185."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
34 / 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is 17."
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so the total number of times is:
3 * 5 = 15

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. 
So, the total number of times for these 2 days is:
6 * 2 = 12

Now, we add the total number of times for both types of days:
15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times in a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he had twice as many orange fish as white fish after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish after the purchase is 2 times the number of white fish.

The total number of orange fish initially was 3, and the total number of white fish initially was 4. After buying 'x' white fish, the total number of white fish becomes 4 + x.

The total number of orange fish after the purchase is 3 + (the number of orange fish he bought). Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + (number of orange fish bought) = 2(4 + x)

We know that the number of orange fish bought is equal to the number of white fish bought, which is 'x'. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

3 + x = 2(4 + x)

Expanding the equation, we get:

3 + x = 8 + 2x

Subtracting 'x' from both sides, we get:

3 = 8 + x

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

-5 = x

Since the number of fish cannot be negative, this solution doesn't make sense. However, let's re-examine the equation.

The correct equation should be:

3 + x = 2(4 + x)

"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy travels to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day.

The total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Now, we need to convert the total distance to gallons. Since Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can divide the total distance by his fuel efficiency to get the total gallons consumed:

50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Now, we can multiply the total gallons by the price of gas to find the total cost:

5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

The value of the quarters: 
140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

The value of the twenties she spent: 
10 * 3/5 = 6
6 * $20 = $120

The total amount of money she paid for lunch:

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to first find the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs.
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of non-OLED TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

The final answer is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost, we can calculate this as follows:

Total cost of the trip: $300
School's contribution: $300 / 2 = $150

Now, we need to subtract the amount John has from the total cost minus the school's contribution to find out how much he is missing:

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) = $150
$150 (John's remaining amount) - $50 (John's money) = $100

John is missing $100."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the day and night. 

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder at night. So, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, and it's 12 degrees colder at night, Carson needs to heat the house up from 12 to 32 degrees. 

To do this, he needs to heat 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is 4."
"To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the final number of people on the train, we need to follow the sequence of events:

"To find the total caroling time, we need to add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so it will take 2 x 150 = 300 seconds to sing it twice.
""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, so it will take 1 x 240 = 240 seconds to sing it once.

Now, we add the time for both songs: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The total caroling time will be 540 seconds."
"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after each raise.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. 
After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.
On his first anniversary, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours:
$11.50 * 20 = $230

Since Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, her starting hourly wage is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00.
Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:
$11.00 * 20 = $220

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings:
$230 - $220 = $10

Number of students: 40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students
Number of teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. To do this, we multiply 14 by 0.3 (since 30% is equal to 0.3):

14 * 0.3 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

Bubbles should buy 4 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional hours she played in the last week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. Kris plays half an hour every day, so she played 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

In the last week, Kris plays 2 hours every day, so she played 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the last week.

Total hours played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. Since she has already played 21 hours, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 46%"
"To find the total number of glass chips Milo has, we need to multiply the number of chips in one bag by the number of bags he has. 

Number of chips in one bag = 72
Number of bags = 2

Total number of chips = 72 * 2 = 144

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we need to divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the total area of the mosaic.

Total area = 144 / 12 = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by multiplying the area by the height.

Length = Area * Height
Length = 12 * 3
Length = 36 inches

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount: 10 (remaining) + 38 (consumed) = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert 48 quarts to gallons by dividing by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Dale started with 100 candies and sold 150, so he has 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible since he can't have a negative number of candies.

Then, he ordered 100 more candies, so now he has 100 + 100 = 200 candies.

Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy."

"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type:
- 1 * 5 = 5 petals
- 1 * 6 = 6 petals
- 1 * 4 = 4 petals
- 1 * 7 = 7 petals

Now, let's subtract the dropped petals from the total:

The final answer is 79."
"To find out how many S'mores they can make, we need to first find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag after dropping 3 marshmallows.

Initially, there were 35 marshmallows in the bag. They dropped 3, so the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 3 = 32.

John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores. So, the total number of S'mores made is 9 + 9 = 18.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of marshmallows used is 18.

Now, we subtract the number of marshmallows used from the number of marshmallows left: 32 - 18 = 14.

So, there are 14 marshmallows left in the bag.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 (since each S'more uses 2 marshmallows). 

14 / 2 = 7.

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the time each person played and multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 20 minutes, his friend plays for 10 minutes, and the other friend plays for 30 minutes. The better friend plays for 30 minutes.

Total time played = 20 + 10 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, we can calculate the cost:
Cost per hour = 1 quarter = $0.25
Total cost = 1 hour * $0.25 = $0.25

The answer is $0.25."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of oil as O, salt as S, fragrance as F, citrus zest as Z, and sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so O + S + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
O + S + S + S + S = 10 (since S = G and Z = F)
O + 3S = 10

We also know that O = 2S, so we can substitute this into the equation:
2S + 3S = 10
5S = 10

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
S = 2

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2 * 2
O = 4

The final answer is: 4"

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2 (since 20% = 20/100 = 0.2).
   40 * 0.2 = 8 cars sold.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left. We subtract the cars he sold and gave away from his initial number of cars.
   40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is 16."

Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
= $175,000 - $50,000
= $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students

"Let's break down the information given:

Let's say PJ has x cards.
Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.
Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:
Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The total number of eggs Cindy had is 27."
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound and add the distance by the cost per mile.

Weight cost: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance cost: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate 75% of $32.
Refund amount: 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total cost of the book and shipping.
Loss amount: $32 (book cost) + $3 (shipping cost) - $24 (refund) = $11

The final answer is: $11"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had.

Initial amount: $40
Amount given by her father: $100
Total amount: $40 + $100 = $140

Cost of two pairs of jeans: 2 * $30 = $60
Total cost: $60 + $20 (bag) = $80

Amount left: $140 - $80 = $60

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

Week 1: 8,000 bars
Week 2: Half of Week 1 = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Week 3: Three times as much as Week 1 = 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Since the problem doesn't mention any production in the fourth week, we can assume that Boris maintains the same production rate as the third week.

Week 4: Same as Week 3 = 24,000 bars

The total production for the first four weeks is:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 + 24,000 = 56,000 bars

However, the question asks for the production in the fourth week. The answer is 24,000."
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them together.

Time spent on TikTok videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok per week: 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time spent on TikTok per week by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

The final answer is: 1128"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items.

The standard items are: 
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The cost of the standard items is: 
$129.00

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. 
- The cost of the additional mirrors is: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
- The cost of the additional chandeliers is: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
- The cost of the additional pictures is: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

The cost of the additional items is: 
2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00"
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Roy has $42.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the mountains that each person can lift.

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is 40."
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroos. Since 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of each turtle is:
Speed of each turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of each turtle = 3 hours

Now, we need to find the time it takes for 4 turtles to cover the same distance. Since the distance remains the same, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed

We know the speed of each turtle, so we can find the time it takes for 4 turtles to cover the distance:
Time = Distance / (4 * Speed of each turtle)
Time = Distance / (4 * 3 hours)
Time = Distance / 12 hours

Since we don't know the exact distance, we can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up a proportion to relate the time it takes for the kangaroos and the turtles:

(3 kangaroos * 6 hours) = (4 turtles * x hours)

Simplifying the equation:
18 hours = 4x hours
x = 18 hours / 4
x = 4.5 hours

So, it will take 4.5 hours for 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cover the distance.

"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to first find out how many dishes each of them made.

Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we can add up the number of dishes made by each of them: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80. So, the total amount she has now is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation: $230 + x = $400, where x is the amount she has in her purse.

To find x, we subtract $230 from both sides of the equation: x = $400 - $230.
x = $170.

The final answer is: $170"
"To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately.

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the current 3 cows produce.

3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

Since the farmer wants 25 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 more liters (25 - 15 = 10).

10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

The farmer currently has 3 cows, so he needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and then add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm):
(5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm):
(1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of the glue stick (12 mm):
(1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. 
Total amount Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

The total cost of the items he wants to buy = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Now, let's subtract the total amount Gabriel has from the total cost of the items:
$10800 - $5200 = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600 to buy the car and the phone."
"To find the change, we need to calculate the total amount Thea gave to the craftsman and subtract it from the price of the hat.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Jack has 30 socks.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60

So, Peter has 60 socks.

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has twice as many dishes as Jack, so we can find the number of dishes Peter has by multiplying 60 by 2.

60 * 2 = 120

So, Peter has 120 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes.

60 (Peter's socks) + 120 (Peter's dishes) + 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 230

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 230."

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

For the first year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 1 year is $300 + $225 = $525.

For the second year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 2 years is $525 + $225 = $750.

For the third year, the interest earned is $225, so the total amount after 3 years is $750 + $225 = $975.

"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Let's denote my age as A, my brother's age as B, and my sister's age as S.

2. I am three years younger than my brother, so A = B - 3.

3. I am 2 years older than my sister, so A = S + 2.

4. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so M = 3B - 1.

5. The sum of our ages is 87, so A + B + S + M = 87.

Now, we can substitute the expressions for A, B, and M from the previous steps into the equation:

(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

5B - 8 = 87

Add 8 to both sides:

5B = 95

Divide by 5:

B = 19

Now that we know B, we can find A and S:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 70 - 30 
x = 40

So, Gretchen had 40 silver coins. 
To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins and gold coins:

"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2.

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Now, we know that the carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes to find the weight of the carrots.

Weight of carrots = weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how many jello cups Greg needs, we need to multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will have. 

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. 

Number of cups per box: 10
Total cups needed: 120
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box.

Number of boxes needed: 12
Cost per box: $1.25
Total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, multiply the number of phones by the price per phone: 
5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays 40% of the total cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is $40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces were left after the first day:
60 - (2/5 * 60) = 60 - 24 = 36

Then, let's subtract the 10 pieces he ate on the second day:
36 - 10 = 26

Now, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the third day:
7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since we can't eat a fraction of a piece)

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
2/5 * 60 = 24
24 + 10 = 34
34 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far.

"To find out how much money David has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Since David wants to buy 16 bolts, the total cost will be:
16 * $0.03 = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount David has:
$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find Ella's hourly rate, we need to divide her earnings by the number of hours she worked.

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Paul starts with 52 marbles.
2. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
3. Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is 20. So, he lost 20 marbles.
4. Now, we subtract the marbles he lost from the total: 80 - 20 = 60.

Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300.

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he will make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much Isaias paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to sell the chickens for by the number of chickens:

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each."
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, they each sold 10.67 glasses.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold.

14 (Julie's glasses) - 10.67 (Micah's glasses) = 3.33

The final answer is 3.33."
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to calculate the total cost of the new rope and subtract it from the total amount of money she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost of the new rope is:
1.5 * 20 = $30

Sarah has the original rope, which is 20 meters long, and it costs $2 per meter, so the total amount of money she has is:
2 * 20 = $40

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money she has:
40 - 30 = $10

Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's present age. 

Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. 

Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 18

Now, we solve for 'x': 
x = 18 - 10 
x = 8

Now that we know Melanie's present age is 8, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Thrice her present age is 3 * 8 = 24. 

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24. 
Let's denote the number of years as 'y'. 
We can set up the equation: 
8 + y = 24

Now, we solve for 'y': 
y = 24 - 8 
y = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 * 2 * $10 = $120.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 * (1/2 * $4) = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left:
$65 - $156 = -$91

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, it means Kelly has overspent her budget."
"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert and then divide by 2.

Let's break it down:

1. Total runtime of the final concert = 65 minutes
2. Encore time = 15 minutes
3. Total runtime without encore = 65 - 15 = 50 minutes
4. Runtime of the final concert (which is twice the usual concert) = 50 minutes
5. Runtime of the usual concert = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many, so they make 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the total number of chimichangas made on those three days:
125 + 125 + 250 = 500

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To find the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs, we first need to find the number of microphones that can fit in pairs. 

Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, 80% of the microphones can be arranged in pairs. 

Number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs = 80% of 50
= 0.8 * 50
= 40

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:
40 / 2
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds flying overhead: 
2/3 of 6 birds = (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds

Next, let's find the total number of birds feeding: 
3 groups of 8 birds each = 3 * 8 = 24 birds

Now, let's add the birds in the bushes, flying overhead, and feeding together: 
6 (birds in the bushes) + 4 (birds flying overhead) + 24 (birds feeding) = 34 birds

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first find out how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies.

Initial number of cookies = 55
Cookies eaten = 5
Cookies left = 55 - 5 = 50

Since Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5 = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 
5 orchids * 5 petals = 25 petals

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 
4 daisies * 10 petals = 40 petals

Now, subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference:
40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"To find the number of indoor plants, we need to calculate one-fourth of 100 plants. 

One-fourth of 100 is 100 / 4 = 25.

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants. 
100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants. 
Two-thirds of 75 is 75 * (2/3) = 50.

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants. 
75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the equation:

Whatchamacallit's speed = 11 * Thingamabob's speed

We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

121 = 11 * Thingamabob's speed

To find the thingamabob's speed, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

Thingamabob's speed = 121 / 11
Thingamabob's speed = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the thingamabob's speed, we can find the whirligig's speed. Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, we can multiply the thingamabob's speed by 5:

Whirligig's speed = 5 * Thingamabob's speed
Whirligig's speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig's speed = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first find the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The cost of the salad is $6. 
The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it is $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage of $10. 

$10 (original wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 (new wage)

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

$12 (new wage) * 8 (hours per day) * 5 (days per week) = $480

Mark makes $480 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is 3x + 5x + x = 9x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed Joe's lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. 

So, 6x + 80 = 80

Subtracting 80 from both sides, we get:
6x = 0

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:
x = 0

Since x = 0, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn zero times, which means she didn't make any money from mowing lawns. 

Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis' distance first. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:
Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"

"To find out how many pages Denise read today, we need to know how many pages Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 more than that, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages.

Now, let's compare the total pages read by Denise and Daniel. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 18 pages and Daniel read 0 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise. 

Denise's total pages = 10 + 18 = 28
Daniel's total pages = 13 + 0 = 13

Now, subtracting Daniel's total pages from Denise's total pages:
28 - 13 = 15

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4x = 8 bowls. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 adults. 

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, Calvin will have 0 bowls left for the children. 

However, the pot can fill 8 child's bowls. Calvin's children will have 8 bowls of soup for lunch. 

Since there are 2 children, each child can have 8 / 2 = 4 bowls of soup for lunch."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

2. We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation: D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

3. We are given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can substitute D = 60 into the equation: 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)

4. Simplify the equation: 52 = 2A - 8

5. Add 8 to both sides of the equation: 60 = 2A

6. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: A = 30

7. Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years: A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked each day:
5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours

The total hours worked by Bruce in these three days is 23."
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

1. The cake costs $11.
2. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since each balloon costs $0.5, the total cost of the balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent: $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each of them had initially. 

$31 / 2 = $15.5.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.5."
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

Number of students playing tennis: 6
Number of students playing volleyball: 2 * 6 = 12
Number of students playing soccer: 16 + 22 = 38

Total number of students: 6 + 12 + 38 = 56

56"
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold, the total cost of the lollipops, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 * 10
Total number of lollipops sold = 300

Total revenue = Total number of lollipops sold * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Total cost = Total number of lollipops sold * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total number of slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

4"
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and is now 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is:

10 years * 12 months/year = 120 months

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is:

120 months * 1 shell/month = 120 shells

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we first need to find the total number of cups of mint tea. 

Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Since she divides the cups into 3 rows, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find the number of round trips he can make in 8 hours.

8 hours / 4 hours per round trip = 2 round trips

Since the sloth makes a round trip (down and back up), we need to multiply the number of round trips by 2 to find the total number of trips.

2 round trips * 2 = 4 trips

Now, we need to find the total number of berries the sloth can pick in 8 hours. We know he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to find the number of berries per trip.

24 berries / 4 trips = 6 berries per trip

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate half of the pool's water capacity. 

Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we need to subtract 500 gallons for each day that passes. 

After 6 days, the amount of water in the tank will be:
5000 - (500 * 6) = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is 2000."
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday, so he has 0 tickets left for Fridays. However, he can still see movies on Saturdays. 

Let's assume he wants to see x movies on Saturdays. The cost of these movies will be 10x. Since he has $134 left, we can set up the equation:

10x + 8 ≤ 134

Subtract 8 from both sides:

10x ≤ 126

Divide both sides by 10:

x ≤ 12.6

Since Colby can't see a fraction of a movie, we'll round down to 12. 

So, Colby can see 12 movies on Saturdays.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to first find the total number of Junebugs removed.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60.

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 60."
"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

The bus traveled 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.
The car traveled 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

To find the difference, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie already had from the total number of toys she now has.

Total number of toys initially = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48

Total number of toys now = 62

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys now - Total number of toys initially
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to create equations.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

From the information given, we have two equations:

1. A = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than Jean)
2. P = A + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age)

We also know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can write the third equation:

P + A + J = 100

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation:

(A + 10) + A + J = 100

Combine like terms:

2A + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2A + J = 90

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:

2(A + J) + J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2A + 2J + J = 90

Combine like terms:

2A + 3J = 90

Now, we have two equations with two variables:

A = J + 10
2A + 3J = 90

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

2(J + 10) + 3J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2J + 20 + 3J = 90

Combine like terms:

5J + 20 = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides:

5J = 70

Divide both sides by 5:

J = 14

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age using the first equation:

A = J + 10
A = 14 + 10
A = 24

Finally, we can find Peter's age using the second equation:

P = A + J
P = 24 + 14
P = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is:
4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons
Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes:
8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial balloons and the additional balloons:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

The total number of balloons the girls have is 24."
"To find the total number of boxes, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes
Total boxes: 50 + 10 = 60 boxes

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

Number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we need to subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed to find the new tables required.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the total distance each person spat, we need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed was spat.

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet
Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet

To find the average total distance, we need to add the total distances and divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
= (400 + 420) / 2
= 820 / 2
= 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To find the daily profit from each machine, we need to calculate the number of widgets produced and then multiply it by the selling price.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Widgets per day: 60 * 24 = 1440
Widgets per month: 1440 * 30 = 43,200
Daily profit: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Widgets per day: 45 * 24 = 1080
Widgets per month: 1080 * 30 = 32,400
Daily profit: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in daily profits:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month."
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to find out how many hours Cameron will be staying at the hotel. 

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. So, he will be staying for 18 hours.

Since the 12-hour mark is already included in the initial 18 hours, Cameron will be charged for 6 additional hours (18 - 12 = 6). 

The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos. The cost for the additional 6 hours is 6 * 70 = 420 pesos. 

The total cost is 1000 + 420 = 1420 pesos.

The cost for a 24-hour stay would be 1600 pesos. 

Cameron will save 1600 - 1420 = 180 pesos.

The final answer is 180."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we need to calculate the amount of hay each goat and sheep needs.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, so each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:
15 goats * 5 pounds = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds = 84 pounds

Total amount of hay needed = 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how much John earned, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked.

John's earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

John spent 50 dollars on gas, so we subtract that from his earnings:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining earnings:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars

John buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so we subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining earnings:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars

Now, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with 100 dollars. To do this, we divide 100 by 25:
100 / 25 = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total:
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students.

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each pupil gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Total fixed charge = $40

Cost of parts = $60

Total cost = Labor cost + Total fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs. 

The original price of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

Now, let's calculate how much money James made from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold each CD for $40, so he made 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the money he made from the money he spent. 
$90 - $200 = -$110.

James was out $110."
"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total value of each type of root crop and then add them together.

The value of the yams: 6 * $1.5 = $9
The value of the sweet potatoes: 10 * $2 = $20
The value of the carrots: 4 * $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add the values together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles
Time = 10 hours
Distance covered = 2 miles per hour * 10 hours
Distance covered = 20 miles

Since James swims 60% of the distance, we can calculate the distance he swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance covered = 0.6 * 20 miles
Distance covered = 12 miles

Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Step 4: Calculate the time James takes to swim the remaining distance at half the speed.
New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 5: Calculate the total time James takes to get across the lake.
Swimming time = 10 hours
Rest time = 10 hours / 2
Rest time = 5 hours
Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time (remaining)
Total time = 10 hours + 5 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 23 hours

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events:

1. She starts with 15 stickers.
2. She loses 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.
3. She receives 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given. 

Let's denote Leo's age as L, Marcus's age as M, and Deanna's age as D. 

We know that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so M = 0.5L.

Additionally, Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5.

Now we can substitute the value of M from the second equation into the third equation: 
0.5L = D - 5
0.5L = 26 - 5
0.5L = 21

To find Leo's age, we multiply both sides by 2:
L = 21 * 2
L = 42

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the points scored by Azibo as 'x'. 

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 20. 
Dinar scored 10 points less than Bahati, so Dinar's points can be represented as (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10.

We know that the total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to first find the number of pages per inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, there are 2 pages per inch.

Now, we know the book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the number of pages, we multiply the thickness by the number of pages per inch:

1.5 inches * 2 pages/inch = 3 pages

So, the book has 3 pages."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

8:00 AM to 12:00 PM is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours, which is 660 minutes.

Total minutes = 240 + 660 = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports stapled.

Total reports = 900 / 15 = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she slept from 2:15 to 2:38 am. 
2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes

Since she usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.
10 p.m. to 12 a.m. = 2 hours = 120 minutes
12 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. = 5 hours and 55 minutes = 5 * 60 + 55 = 355 minutes
Total minutes from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. = 120 + 355 = 475 minutes

Now, we subtract the minutes she woke up early (5 minutes) from the total minutes she slept.
475 - 5 = 470 minutes

Now, we add the minutes she slept from 2:15 to 2:38 am to the total minutes she slept.
470 + 23 = 493 minutes

The final answer is: 493"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has 2 dozen cups, we first need to convert 2 dozen to the total number of cups. 
1 dozen = 12, so 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups:
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups.

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, initially, 200 beds are occupied.

Now, let's calculate the number of days in 2 weeks: 
2 weeks = 14 days

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is:
50 * 14 = 700 patients

The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is the sum of the initial occupied beds and the newly admitted patients:
200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we know that Robyn sends 16 emails a day in total. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder of the emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder are to her family. To find two-thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2/3. 

9 * (2/3) = 6

So, 6 emails are to her family. 

Now, we need to find out how many emails are to her boyfriend. We know that the remainder after removing the work emails is 9, and 6 of those are to her family. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

Therefore, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

Aliya is 3 years old, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we multiply Shawna's age by 5. 
Shawna's father is 9 * 5 = 45 years old."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the original number of people reported by Courtney (48) and subtract that from the original number.

20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the correct number of people who attended the concert:

48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is approximately 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of balls that Jeffrey picked up and carried. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up an equation: 
Jason's balls = 2 * Jeffrey's balls
2 = 2 * Jeffrey's balls
Jeffrey's balls = 1

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up another equation:
Jordan's balls = 2 * Jason's balls
Jordan's balls = 2 * 2
Jordan's balls = 4

Now, we know that the total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. They dug 13 holes on the second day.
3. They dug 8 holes on the third day, but 2 of those holes were filled in, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.
4. The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, so the total number of holes on the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116 holes.
6. Since the pirates found the treasure on the fourth day, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is: 87"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the number the others got, we can represent Collins' amount as 70 + 15 = 85.

Now, we know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the amounts Amora, Lainey, and Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 85, we can add these amounts together to find the total.

70 + 70 + 85 = 225

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

The total cost of the travel is $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the information given:

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the expression for X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance covered in each leg of the journey and then add them together.

Leg 1: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Leg 2: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Leg 3: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Total distance = Leg 1 + Leg 2 + Leg 3
Total distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 446 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years.
So, Nani's sister is 8 - 6 = 2 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members:
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 2 (sister) = 26 years.

The total age of the family members is 26 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and add them together.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

Now, we can add the number of players in both teams to find the total:

Total number of players = Number of players in Zeke's team + Number of players in Carlton's team
= 20 + 13
= 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is the distance around the garden, which can be calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total number of wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total number of wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total number of wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box.

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the initial number of boxes:
240 - 4 = 236 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find 1/4 of 236:
236 * 1/4 = 59 oranges

Now, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total:
236 - 59 = 177 oranges

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 177 oranges.

177"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and India.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate it as follows:
Half of 50 is 25.
25 + 4 = 29.

So, India has 29 states.

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India:
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how much money Tyler needs to buy the books, we need to add the costs of the dictionary, dinosaur book, and children's cookbook.

$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has $14, he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more to afford the books.

To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cherries Jerry has. 

We know that Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard. So, we can set up an equation to find Richard's cherries: 
Let's say Richard has x cherries. 
Since Robert has 10 more than Richard, Robert has x + 10 cherries. 
We know Robert has 30 cherries, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 10 = 30 
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 
x = 20 
So, Richard has 20 cherries. 
Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. 
So, Jerry has 60 - 50 = 10 cherries. 
Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry: 
Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday, we need to subtract 4 from the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday. 

Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday = 15
Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday = 15 - 4 = 11

To find out how many boxes of gingerbread Sunny sold on Sunday, we need to add 5 to the number of boxes of gingerbread he sold on Saturday.

Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday = 10
Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

Total earnings on Saturday = (Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday * Price of gingerbread) + (Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday * Price of apple pie)
Total earnings on Saturday = (10 * 6) + (11 * 15)
Total earnings on Saturday = 60 + 165
Total earnings on Saturday = 225

Total earnings on Sunday = (Number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday * Price of gingerbread) + (Number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday * Price of apple pie)
Total earnings on Sunday = (15 * 6) + (15 * 15)
Total earnings on Sunday = 90 + 225
Total earnings on Sunday = 315

Total earnings for two days = Total earnings on Saturday + Total earnings on Sunday
Total earnings for two days = 225 + 315
Total earnings for two days = 540

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

From point 2, we can write the equation: 24 = 0.5D (since Emil will be half the age of his dad when he is 24)

From point 3, we can write the equation: 24 = 2B (since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he is 24)

Now, we can solve for D and B:

D = 24 / 0.5 = 48
B = 24 / 2 = 12

Now that we know the ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages:

D + B = 48 + 12 = 60

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and then add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

First, convert the length of the bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space each plant occupies: 
12 inches (plant width) + 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot (space between plants) = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the bed by the space each plant occupies: 
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be: 
27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

9 pretzels a day * 7 days a week = 63 pretzels a week.

"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00 per year

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside for shoes in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how many minutes it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, it will take her 30 / 6 = 5 minutes to peel 30 shrimp.

Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, it will take her 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp.

So, it will take her 5 minutes to peel and 10 minutes to cook, for a total of 5 + 10 = 15 minutes to peel and cook 30 shrimp.

To find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we multiply the time it takes to peel and cook 30 shrimp by 3. 15 * 3 = 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total temperature change.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours, so the total cooling effect is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high. It ran on high for 4 hours, so the total cooling effect is 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

The room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. It was off for 2 hours, so the total warming effect is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change. The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees. The total warming effect is 4 degrees. The net temperature change is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Since the air conditioner cools the room, the final temperature is lower than the starting temperature. The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as (x - 30).

Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can set up the equation:

x = 3 * (x - 30)

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 3x - 90
x - 3x = -90
-2x = -90
x = 45

So, Bill was 45 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. 

Since the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, it makes 3/4x flights to Greece. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so it makes 1/4x flights to each of these countries.

We are also given that the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 trips.

Now, we know that the total number of flights made by the first plane is the sum of the flights to Greece, France, and Germany. We can set up the equation:

3/4x + 1/4x + 1/4x = 88

Combine like terms:

2/4x = 88

Simplify the fraction:

1/2x = 88

Multiply both sides by 2:

x = 176

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France. Since the first plane makes 1/4x flights to France, we can substitute x = 176:

1/4 * 176 = 44

The first plane makes 44 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam initially bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20. We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4 years respectively. 

Let's denote the age of Helene as H and the age of Wilfred as W.

2. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. Since there are 4 children, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years.

3. We are given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. So, H = 2 * 5 = 10 years.

4. Now, we can find the age of Wilfred by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age. 
   W = Total age - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)
   W = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)
   W = 20 - 17
   W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3 years."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on this amount.

However, the problem states that Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This means that Walter's total amount will be $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we can calculate the amount by multiplying the total amount Walter has ($2200) by 3.

$2200 * 3 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people:
750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, we can assume the number of slices for the kids is x and the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms: 3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2 and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, the adult slice is 2 times the kid slice. 

The total number of kid slices is 2, and the total number of adult slices is 4. 

The total number of kid slices is 2, and the total number of adult slices is 4. 

The total number of slices is 6. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the total area of the adult slices and divide it by the total area of the watermelon.

Since we don't know the exact size of the slices, we can assume the kid slice is 1 unit and the adult slice is 2 units.

The total area of the kid slices is 2 units (2 slices * 1 unit per slice) and the total area of the adult slices is 8 units (4 slices * 2 units per slice).

The total area of the watermelon is 10 units (2 kid slices + 8 adult slices).

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the total area of the adult slices by the total area of the watermelon and multiply by 100:

(8 units / 10 units) * 100 = 80%

So, each adult gets 80% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 80%"
"To find the total time spent on inpatients, we multiply the number of inpatients by the time spent per inpatient: 
9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

To find the total time spent on appointments, we multiply the number of appointments by the time spent per appointment: 
10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Now, we add the time spent on inpatients and appointments to find the total time spent: 
180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours: 
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones is spending 8 hours at the clinic. He is available for 9 hours, so we subtract the time spent from the total available time to find the time left: 
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time from the desired serving time:
Desired serving time: 5:00 pm
Total time required: 3 hours

To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To find the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can divide 64 by 8 to find the number of chocolate bars in a box.

64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly cost is $25 * 3 = $75.

The cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. Since there are 10 students, the weekly cost of the students' lessons is $1.50 * 10 * 3 = $45.

The weekly cost of the students' lessons is $45. The monthly cost of the students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total monthly cost of renting the studio and the students' lessons is $300 + $180 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter's total chocolate bars: 64
Number of boxes: 4
Chocolate bars per box: 64 / 4 = 16

Martha's total chocolate bars: 56
Number of boxes: 7
Chocolate bars per box: 56 / 7 = 8

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha.
Difference: 16 - 8 = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

To find the total number of new porcupines in a year, we multiply the number of new porcupines per month by 12.

Total new porcupines in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the initial population of porcupines to the total number of new porcupines in a year to find the final population.

Final population = 50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

The final numerical answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = Length * Width * Depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume * 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons * 0.10
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to first find the number of blue sticks and then the number of yellow sticks.

Number of red sticks = 9
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = 11

Total number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 
55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled: 
45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The difference in distance traveled is 230 miles."
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that half of the students are over 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. 
1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

Now, we know that the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. 
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 are male. 
1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

To find the number of female students over 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16. 
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

To find the number of female students under 16 years old, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16. 
1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 years old to find the total number of female students. 
1125 + 750 = 1875 female students.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps.
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find the total amount of water pumped on the first day, we need to calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

The remaining amount of water for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is 6000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation:
34% + x = 28%
x = 28% - 34%
x = -6%

However, this doesn't make sense, as the charge can't be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's assume the initial charge is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
x - (9% * 5) = x - 45%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
x - 45% - (7% * 3) = x - 45% - 21%
We know that this remaining charge is 28%, so we can set up an equation:
x - 45% - 21% = 28%
x - 66% = 28%
x = 28% + 66%
x = 94%

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.

Final answer: 94"
"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the car's price.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car."
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, the amount of money he has left is $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, this is not possible since he can't spend more than he has. This means he can't buy any more fruits.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

18"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to first find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. 

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to get the time it takes to read one page. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages James read. 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the remaining guests are 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which means 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.
5. The total number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide 60 by 2 to find the number of each type of question.
60 / 2 = 30

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 30 * 0.5 = 15.

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions.
18 + 15 = 33

The final answer is 33."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals as L and the number of small stuffed animals as S.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as P. Then, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3P.

We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so P = $4.

Now, we know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so S = 2L.

We are also given that the total earnings from the sales are $120. The total earnings can be calculated as the sum of the earnings from large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals:

Total earnings = (3P * L) + (P * S)
= (3 * 4 * L) + (4 * 2L)
= 12L + 8L
= 20L

Since the total earnings are $120, we can set up the equation:

20L = 120

To solve for L, we can divide both sides by 20:

L = 120 / 20
L = 6

Now that we know L, we can find S:

S = 2L
= 2 * 6
= 12

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day

Now, multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins and the 10 eggs that were not found.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, we know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then use that information to calculate the price of the third package.

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. 

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches will be 8 * $1.50 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% chance (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 40% chance
3. The substitute teacher comes in and doesn't collect the homework: 60% chance (100% - 40% chance of extension)

Now, we need to find the total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework. We can do this by adding the probabilities of the two scenarios where he has to turn in his homework:

Probability of normal teacher coming in and not giving an extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
Probability of substitute teacher coming in and not collecting homework: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36

Total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework: 0.24 + 0.36 = 0.6

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.6 * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 4750 remaining seats, and there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of small beans Grandpa can eat.

We know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is 2 * 75 = 150.

We also know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, the number of small beans he can eat is 150 * 3 = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily earnings and then subtract her parking expenses.

Daily earnings: 6 hours * $15 per hour = $90
Total earnings for 3 days: $90 * 3 = $270

Parking expenses per day: $3
Total parking expenses for 3 days: $3 * 3 = $9

Total earnings after expenses: $270 - $9 = $261

The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

Now, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / 8 apples/pack
= 80 apples / 8 apples/pack
= 10 packs

The final answer is 10."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is $10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim loses while in school and the total amount of money he earns after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim loses while in school:
Total amount of money lost = Number of years in school * Annual income before college
Total amount of money lost = 4 years * $25,000/year
Total amount of money lost = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earns after graduating:
Total amount of money earned = Number of years in school * Annual income after college
Total amount of money earned = 4 years * $75,000/year (since his income tripled)
Total amount of money earned = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to repay the loans:
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = Total amount of money lost + Total amount of money earned
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = $100,000 + $300,000
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = $400,000

Since Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year, we can calculate the number of years it would take him to repay the loans:
Number of years to repay loans = Total amount of money needed to repay loans / Annual loan amount
Number of years to repay loans = $400,000 / $50,000/year
Number of years to repay loans = 8 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric. Since the fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of the fabric will be:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the fabric:
Area = Length * Width
Area = 8 * 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the area by 2:
Total Area = 2 * 80
Total Area = 160 square feet

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

The total amount Molly will pay is $65 + $36 = $101.

"To find the average amount Johnny lost, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost: $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount by the number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.17.

The average amount Johnny lost that day is $7.17."
"To find the total population, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country, and then multiply that result by the population of each city.

Number of countries: 26
Number of cities per country: 5
Population per city: 1000

Total number of cities: 26 * 5 = 130
Total population: 130 * 1000 = 130,000

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
= 52 inches - 51 inches
= 1 inch

The final answer is 1."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

576.67"
"To find the total hours worked by the painters, we need to calculate the total hours worked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

First, we need to find the total hours worked in a day. Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day, we can convert this to hours by dividing 3/8 by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day).

3/8 ÷ 24 = 3/8 * 1/24 = 3/192 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the hours worked per day by 7:

3/192 hours/day * 7 days = 21/192 hours per week

Now, we need to find the total hours worked by the 4 painters. We multiply the hours worked per week by 4:

21/192 hours/week * 4 = 84/192 hours

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 12:

84/192 = 7/16 hours

So, each painter worked 7/16 hours per week.

The final answer is 7/16."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,620.82
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,620.82 = $9,861.18

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,861.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of non-Spanish books. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

10% of the 50 books are written in German, so that's 0.1 * 50 = 5 German books.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books: 
50 - 25 - 5 = 20

There are 20 Spanish books."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

First, let's calculate the remaining distance:
1955 km (total distance) - 325 km (distance driven) = 1630 km

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons.

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events:

1. Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. Total = 120 + 20 = 140
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. Total = 140 + 100 = 240
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. Total = 240 - 80 = 160

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 160."
"To find the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The package of athletic socks originally costs $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together:
$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To find the total cost of the tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. 

Since the floor area is 200 SqFt and each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the floor by the area of each tile: 
200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost: 
200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400."
"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12.

$192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find the total number of loads, we need to calculate the number of loads for each type of bed and then add them together.

For twin beds: 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads
For king beds: 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, we need to divide the total number of loads by 3 to find the number of loads per week.

Twin loads per week: 208 / 3 = 69.33 (round up to 70 since you can't do a fraction of a load)
King loads per week: 52 / 3 = 17.33 (round up to 18 since you can't do a fraction of a load)

Now, we can calculate the total number of loads per week: 70 + 18 = 88 loads per week

To find the total number of loads per year, multiply the number of loads per week by 52: 88 * 52 = 4560 loads per year

"To find the total number of movies watched in a weekend, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched in a weekend = 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies.

"To find the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to calculate the stickers he had two years ago, last year, and this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers from all three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices they ate by adding up the slices each of them ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18
Betsy's part = 58

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

1. The cost of the cast: $200

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, let's add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups: 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.
3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.
4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched.

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs and then apply the discount.

Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds. 

6 pounds / 2 pounds per group = 3 groups

Since each group costs 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be:
3 groups * 1.5 pounds per group = 4.5 pounds

The cost of 4.5 pounds of butter is 4.5 * $4.00 = $18.00

The final answer is $18.00."

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
10 bananas/day * 7 days = 70 bananas
14 bananas/day * 7 days = 98 bananas

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is:
315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas

The third monkey eats 147 bananas / 7 days = 21 bananas per day.

"To find out how much Jenny spent on roses, we need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, 15 roses will cost 15 * 1.25 (1 dozen = 12 roses, so 15 roses = 1.25 dozen) = $18.75.

Jenny has 5 $5 bills, so she has a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the cost of roses from the total amount she has: $25 - $18.75 = $6.25.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we divide $6.25 by 0.25 to get 25 quarters.

"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between each train's arrival and departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time between the first train's arrival and departure is 20 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time between the second train's arrival and departure is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the second train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the time between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after the third train's arrival. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:
- Waiting for the first train: 20 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 30 minutes (since it arrives after the first train leaves)
- Waiting for the third train: 60 minutes (since it arrives after the second train leaves)
- Waiting for the fourth train: 20 minutes (since it arrives after the third train leaves)

Total waiting time = 20 + 30 + 60 + 20 = 130 minutes

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80"
"To find the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for, we need to calculate 75% of the original price.

75% of $2000 = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500

Now, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. 

120% of $1500 = 1.2 * $1500 = $1800

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price, then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

Discount = ((Original price - Selling price) / Original price) * 100
= (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100
= ($200 / $2000) * 100
= 0.1 * 100
= 10%

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we can calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours as follows:

1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
So, 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds

Number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours = 3600 seconds/hour * 4 hours = 14400 jellyfish

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be:

Total jellyfish = 5 springs * 14400 jellyfish/spring = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it.

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

So, Frankie's score is 195.

195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, he walked 2 miles (half of 4 miles). 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time to walk to the store = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, he has to walk back home, which is also 2 miles. 

Time to walk back home = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought. Since she bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she bought a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is $2.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

The answer is 20."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4 years).

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply the price of each type by the number sold.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= 67500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= 11250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB bike
= 105 * 500
= 52500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= 67500 + 11250 + 52500
= 132500

The final answer is: 132500"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in classes, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in classes per week.

Number of classes per week = 5 days * 2 classes/day = 10 classes
Total minutes per class = 40 minutes
Total minutes per week = 10 classes * 40 minutes/class = 400 minutes

Since John also spends extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends on these days.

Extra learning time per day = 1/16 * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 7.5 minutes
Total extra learning time per week = 7.5 minutes/day * 2 days = 15 minutes

Now, we can find the total minutes John spends learning per week:
Total minutes per week = Total minutes in classes + Total extra learning time per week
Total minutes per week = 400 minutes + 15 minutes = 415 minutes

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Total hours per week = 415 minutes / 60 = 6.92 hours

The final answer is 6.92."
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, which is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the amount left after the T-Rex ate is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the initial amount is 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total area of the room, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the room is the sum of the areas of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, 3 of which are shaken.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. The number of shaken sodas remains 3.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda, leaving 2 shaken sodas. The number of unshaken sodas remains 11.
4. Ellen's friend takes 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend takes a shaken soda. There are 2 shaken sodas out of 11 remaining sodas. 

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)
Probability = 2/11

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Probability = (2/11) * 100 = 18.18%

The final answer is 18.18."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the total number of days he is available to work and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

March has 31 days, and Billy takes 20% of the days off. 
20% of 31 is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

Billy is available to work 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. 
So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to work by the number of people he can help per day:
25 days * 6 people/day = 150 people.

The final answer is 150."

20 + 10 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time per day in hours: 60 / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5.

Total time for 5 days: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles. 
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles together. 

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three. 
52 - 36 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on her credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items purchased after the discounts.

1. The item that was returned is $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

2. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00. The new cost of the frying pan is $16.00.

3. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00. The new cost of the towels is $27.00.

Now, we add the new costs of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are large and change color. We can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Chris is 4 years old.

Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her annual savings and then divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings.

First, let's calculate her annual savings:
Annual salary: $100,000
Savings percentage: 20%
Annual savings: $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement:
Retirement period: 20 years
Annual savings: $20,000
Total amount needed: $20,000 * 20 = $400,000

Since Lauren will live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be:
Annual salary: $100,000
Expenses percentage: 40%
Annual expenses: $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000

Now, let's calculate her annual savings after expenses:
Annual savings: $20,000
Annual expenses: $40,000
Annual savings after expenses: $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000 (This means she is spending more than she is saving, which is not possible. We will assume she saves 20% of her income after expenses)

Let's recalculate her annual savings after expenses:
Annual salary: $100,000
Expenses percentage: 40%
Annual expenses: $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000
Annual income after expenses: $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000
Annual savings after expenses: $60,000 * 0.20 = $12,000

Now, let's calculate the number of years she needs to work to save $400,000:
Total amount needed: $400,000
Annual savings after expenses: $12,000
Number of years: $400,000 / $12,000 = 33.33 years

Since Lauren can't work a fraction of a year, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 34 years to save $400,000.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total number of students is x. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since we want to find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"

"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels. 

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the total number of heels, which is 6. 

Average height = Total height / Total number of heels

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles she wants to hike (9,300 miles) by the number of days in June (30 days). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already hiking 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily miles to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Raymond has $8 left.

$8"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so she actually had $12 - $2 = $10 left. But we know she had $2 left, so the $2 must be the amount she had after buying the books, not the amount she had before buying the books. 

This means that the $10 she had before buying the books is the amount she spent on the books. Since she bought 2 books, we can divide the $10 by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$10 ÷ 2 = $5

So, each book cost $5."

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so the rate is 255 / 5 = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can divide the total number of blinks (459) by the rate (51 blinks per minute) to find the time it takes to blink 459 times:

459 / 51 = 9 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks. 

So, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the 5th worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10):

20 / 10 = 2

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight:
15 + 30 = 45 pounds

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 45 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 2 * 16 = 32 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Luis had 32 stickers. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 32 = 64 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Since John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&M's by 10.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is 90."
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.
3. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so the speed of the faster car is 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. 

Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as x. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago
16 - 2 = 2x
14 = 2x

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 14 / 2
x = 7

So, Vince's age two years ago was 7. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 to his age two years ago:
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted:
Difference = C - A
Difference = 21 - 9
Difference = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will have. 

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the crayons is:
Total weight of crayons = Number of boxes * Weight per box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of the crayons to pounds:
Total weight of crayons in pounds = Total weight of crayons / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons since they are the same weight, so the total weight of the boxes is also 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights:
Total weight = Total weight of crayons + Total weight of boxes
= 12.5 + 12.5
= 25 pounds"
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log.

Total length of the tree = 80 feet
Length of each log = 4 feet

Number of logs = Total length / Length of each log
= 80 / 4
= 20 logs

Since each log is cut into 5 planks, the total number of planks is:
20 logs * 5 planks/log
= 100 planks

Each plank is sold for $1.2, so the total amount John makes is:
100 planks * $1.2/plank
= $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the amount Valerie's brother earns, we need to multiply Valerie's salary by 2, since she earns half of what her brother earns.

Valerie's brother's salary = 2 * Valerie's salary
Valerie's brother's salary = 2 * 5000
Valerie's brother's salary = 10000

Now, we need to find their combined salary.
Combined salary = Valerie's salary + brother's salary
Combined salary = 5000 + 10000
Combined salary = 15000

Since their mother earns twice their combined salary, we multiply the combined salary by 2.
Mother's salary = 2 * combined salary
Mother's salary = 2 * 15000
Mother's salary = 30000

Now, we add the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together.
Total amount = Valerie's salary + brother's salary + mother's salary
Total amount = 5000 + 10000 + 30000
Total amount = 40000

The final answer is: 40000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time spent on the sidewalk. 

Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she walks 3 miles in total, the time spent on the sidewalk is 1 mile. 

We know that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, we can assume that the time spent on the sidewalk is half the time spent on the beach. 

So, the time spent on the sidewalk is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time spent on the walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Total time = 40 minutes (beach) + 20 minutes (sidewalk) = 60 minutes.

The final answer is 60."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 * 8 = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save the remaining amount of $28 at a rate of $4 per week. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

$28"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each type of tree and then add them together.

Three trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.

Two trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.

One tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob has initially. 

We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, if he receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we subtract 24 from 60. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36. 

36 - 10 = 26

So, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the information given:

- Donny has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature.
- He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle.
- The water in the bottle is now drinkable, meaning it's at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the amount of water in the bottle becomes 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of x-degree water. 

The total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. Since the water is now drinkable, the temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees. 

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(4 * 33) + (1 * x) ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x ≥ 40

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 8

So, the second mug must be at least 8 degrees to make the water drinkable after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Total number of cows added in 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added in 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, he has a total of 9 * 4 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's start by finding out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, we need to find out how many scoops 3 less than 6 potatoes make. Since 6 - 3 = 3, 3 less than 6 potatoes make 3 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes 3 scoops make. Since 3 scoops make 3 scoops, we can say that 1 scoop makes 1 potato. 

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 scoop makes 1 potato, 23 scoops make 23 potatoes. 

Now, we subtract 5 from 23 to find out how many scoops Gomer ate: 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Since 1 scoop makes 1 potato, Gomer ate 18 scoops, which is equal to 18 potatoes.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester will eat in 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester will eat in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester will need:

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, we can multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2.

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

The number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

"To find the number of women on the bus initially, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide 84 by 14 to find the value of 1 part: 84 ÷ 14 = 6.

Now, we can multiply the value of 1 part by the number of parts representing women (9) to find the initial number of women: 6 * 9 = 54.

Since 20 women alight from the bus, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

"To find the number of sunflowers sold, we need to first find the total number of bouquets sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and Faraday earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find the number of bouquets sold per day: 
$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since Faraday sold bouquets for 3 days, we multiply the number of bouquets per day by 3:
7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we multiply the total number of bouquets by 12:
21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected.

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells.

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = total number of seashells

Combine like terms:
5x + 5 = total number of seashells

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got:

(5x + 5) / 3

However, we still need to find the value of 'x'. We can use the information that Jim collected 27 seashells. We can set up an equation:

2x + 5 = 27

Subtract 5 from both sides:
2x = 22

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 11

Now that we know 'x', we can find the total number of seashells:
5x + 5 = 5(11) + 5 = 60

Now, divide the total number of seashells by 3:
60 / 3 = 20

So, each person got 20 seashells.

"To find the total energy demand of 2300 people, we need to calculate 20% of 2300 people's daily energy demand. 

20% of 2300 people = 0.20 * 2300 = 460 people

Since each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we need 460 bottles to cover 460 people's energy demands.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to cover 460 people's energy demands.

460 - 4200 = -1740 (This is incorrect, as Hortex can't produce a negative number of bottles)

This means that Hortex can't meet the energy demands of 2300 people with their current production capacity."
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing a bow and the number of babies wearing purple.

Let's assume there are 8 babies (since it's an octuplet). 

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing a bow = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + 1/3 * (number of blue wearers)
= 1/3 * 6 + 1/3 * 2
= 2 + 2/3
= 8/3

Now, we can find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
Probability = (number of purple wearers wearing a bow) / (total number of babies wearing a bow)

"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he earned $50 from this sale.

Abraham then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he earned $30 from this sale.

Now, Abraham has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he earned $3 * 20 = $60 from this sale.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) apartments. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 

So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments. 

John collects garbage from 3 complexes, 3 times a week, so he collects garbage 3 * 3 = 9 times a week. 

He gets paid $0.40 per apartment, so he gets paid 9 * 0.40 = $3.60 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fruits each tree produces in each year.

Year 1: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
Year 2: 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
Year 3: 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
Year 4: 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, so we need to find the 10-year-old tree's production first. Since the 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
Year 5: 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
Year 6: 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by each tree:
Year 1: 50
Year 2: 50 + 150 = 200
Year 3: 200 + 350 = 550
Year 4: 550 + 800 = 1350
Year 5: 1350
Year 6: 1350 + 1000 = 2350

The total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

1/5 of $100 is $20. 
$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation:
B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation:
R = 4B

Now, we are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Let's say Rissa was given x dollars. Since Ronnie was given 1/3 of what Rissa was given, Ronnie was given x/3 dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave away 1/5 of her money. 

So, the amount Rissa gave away is x/5. 

Now, we know that Rissa was given x dollars initially and she gave away x/5 dollars. So, the amount left with Rissa is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. So, we can set up the equation:

4x/5 = 4/5 * x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x/5 = 4x/5

This equation is true for all values of x. However, we know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. So, we can set up another equation:

x = 3 * (x/3)

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half must be the remaining three colors (red, white, and purple). 

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the total amount of paint used by 3 to find the amount of each color. 

12 pints / 3 = 4 pints per color

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is half of the total amount of paint used. 

12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint

Now, we know that the amount of yellow paint is 6 pints, and the amount of each of the other three colors is 4 pints. Since we want to find the amount of red paint, we can simply state that the amount of red paint is 4 pints.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet."
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together.

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add the number of clouds from each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To find the number of cycles, we first need to find the cost of the new box. Since the price remains the same, the new box will have 20% more pods, which means it will have 120 pods.

The cost of the new box is $12, and it has 120 pods. To find the cost per pod, we divide the cost by the number of pods:

$12 ÷ 120 pods = $0.1 per pod

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run for $1. We divide the amount we have ($1) by the cost per pod ($0.1):

$1 ÷ $0.1 = 10

So, you can run 10 cycles with the new box for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals."
"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with less than 2 inches of chalk, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

20% of 2.25 inches = 0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45 inches

Since the teacher has already used 2.25 inches, we need to add the remaining 0.45 inches to the total chalk left.

2.25 + 0.45 = 2.7 inches

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of days:

0.20x = 2.7

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.20:

x = 2.7 / 0.20
x = 13.5

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The teacher will have 13 days before he has to recycle the chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity.

"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more, so the total number of teeth fixed is 4 + 7 = 11.

Now, we can find the percentage of teeth fixed by dividing the total number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (11 / 30) * 100 = 36.67%

The final answer is 36.67."
"To find the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus is returning 1600 gallons of milk, we need to calculate the refund amount.

The cost of 1 gallon of milk is $3.5. So, the total refund amount is:

Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon
= 1600 * 3.5
= 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

We can simplify this equation to:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how much he can spend per school. 

Bob has $27,000 and is distributing it among 3 schools. 

$27,000 ÷ 3 = $9,000 per school.

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find out how many books he can buy per dollar by dividing 100 by 500.

100 ÷ 500 = 0.2 books per dollar.

Now, we multiply the number of books per dollar by the amount he can spend per school.

0.2 books per dollar * $9,000 per school = 1800 books per school.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Newton had 2 apples.
2. He picked up 1 apple and put it in his pocket, leaving him with 1 apple.
3. He threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So now, he has 1 (from the pocket) + 5 (from the tree) = 6 apples.
4. He picked up all but 1 of these apples and put them in his pocket, leaving him with 1 apple.
5. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So now, he has 1 (from the pocket) + 6 (from the tree) = 7 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 7 apples."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags.

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices per friend is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 60 / 12 = 5.

Since the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 60 / 8 = 7.5.

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices for her friends.

So, Kate needs to buy 5 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles
Miles on Tuesday and Thursday: 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles
Total miles = 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's find out how many snowballs melt in 1 hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, in 60 minutes (1 hour), 4 snowballs will melt (2 * 2 = 4). 

Now, let's find the net rate at which Jay builds snowballs. Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, but 4 snowballs melt in 1 hour. So, the net rate is 20 - 4 = 16 snowballs per hour.

To find out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net rate of 16 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 16 = 3.75 hours

So, it will take Jay 3.75 hours to have 60 snowballs.

60"
"To find Jim's age, we need to determine how old John was when Digimon was released. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim at that time, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release was x. Then, John's age at that time would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation:

2x + (number of years since Digimon's release) = 28

Since Digimon was released 20 years ago, we can substitute 20 for the number of years since its release:

2x + 20 = 28

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

2x = 8

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released. To find Jim's current age, we add the number of years that have passed since Digimon's release (20 years) to Jim's age at that time:

Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6

They all ate 6 slices of apple."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had 12 bandages from the first day, so they had 12 + 28 = 40 bandages.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is a total of 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had 40 - 25 = 15 bandages left.

4. Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and they had 15 bandages left after the third day, they must have had 78 + 15 = 93 bandages at the end of the second day.

5. Since they had 40 bandages at the end of the second day, and they ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages on the second day, they must have had 40 + 50 = 90 bandages at the end of the first day.

So, the nurses started with 90 bandages on the first day.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the difference in length of her hair. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. 

The total cost of the haircut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours worked in April = 7.5 * 6 * 4
Total hours worked in April = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Total earnings from hourly rate = 270

Total attendance bonus = $10

Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly rate + Total attendance bonus
Total earnings for April = 270 + 10
Total earnings for April = 280

The final answer is: $280"
"To find the total amount Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and add them together.

Earnings from emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00
Earnings from doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 = $3.00
Earnings from taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
Earnings from cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Total earnings: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we need to first find out how much blood a shark has. 

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we multiply 40 by 3 to find the amount of blood a shark has: 
40 * 3 = 120 gallons

Now, we need to multiply the amount of blood a shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have:
120 * 10 = 1200 gallons

The final answer is 1200."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (40) entered the restaurant. This is 3 * 40 = 120 people. So, the total becomes 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Number of red pens = 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens
Number of black pens = 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens

Total number of pens = 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

The final answer is 75."
"To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the cognac bottles. 

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac bottles cost 50% more than the scotch bottles. Since the scotch bottles cost $600 for 10 bottles, the cost of one scotch bottle is $600 / 10 = $60. 

The cognac bottles cost 50% more than the scotch bottles, so the cost of one cognac bottle is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac bottles is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch bottles plus the cost of the cognac bottles: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted on both days:
White Oak trees: 20 + 30 = 50
Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 + 50 = 90

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days: 50 + 90 = 140"
"To find out how much root beer was available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were drunk, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were drunk, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Now, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 4 people to find out how much each person got.

5 / 4 = 1.25 gallons per person.

The final answer is 1.25."
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given statement into an equation. 

Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is x.

The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

The statement ""is 40"" can be written as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

Now, we need to solve for x. 

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to find one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find the number of remaining fish. 
66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish. 
5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To find the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy initially had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, the question asks for the height from the second floor's floor, which means we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor. 

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 - 240 = -60 inches. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. 

Let's re-evaluate the question. The question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor. This means we need to find the height of the roof above the second floor.

"To find the number of shells team Alphas found, we need to calculate 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

700 - 280 = 420

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we need to find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.

420 - 252 = 168

"To find the total miles the dogs need to walk per day, we can multiply the number of dogs by the average miles per dog. 

4 dogs * 3 miles per dog = 12 miles

Since we know the first three dogs' exercise needs, we can subtract those from the total to find the last dog's exercise need.

12 miles - 1 mile - 4 miles - 3 miles = 4 miles

The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day.

"To find out how much John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of $250,000.

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 
60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas.

Total weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram.

Total earnings = Total weight * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg
Total earnings = $64

The final answer is $64."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 
Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
= (11 * 9) 
= 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= 99 - 72
= 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount removed at each setting and add them together.

At the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount removed is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

At the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount removed is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

At the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount removed is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the amounts removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons.

"To find the total amount Stephen needs to pay, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

So, the total amount Stephen owes is $300 (initial) + $6 (interest) = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

Now, to find the amount he needs to pay in the 12th month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the 12th month.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the efficiency and the percentage of red jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is the area of the base times the height: 
6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8:
540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3:
675 * 0.3 = 202.5.

The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so the difference between the estimated and true number of red jelly beans is:
900 - 202.5 = 697.5.

"To find the total number of people on the bus, we need to follow the steps:

1. The bus had 20 people initially.
2. 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, so the total number of people on the bus is 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30.
   So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station.
   The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. 
   The number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

"Initially, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 5 years. 
The initial cost of one visit is $2. 
So, the total cost for 5 years is 3 * 5 * 2 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. 
The new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5.

For the next 3 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year. 
The total cost for 3 years is 3 * 3 * 5 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find the total number of students who can try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of students in grades 4-7. Since there are 4 grades, and each grade has 10 students, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups. 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can write the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x
= 4(8)
= 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to first determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

"To solve this problem, we need to first define the variables. Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly made is 'c' and the number of brownies is 'b'. 

We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as an equation: 
b = 3c - 2

We also know that Carly's class has 5 people and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write another equation:
c + b = 10

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:
4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:
4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4:
c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

So, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for each foot). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send 3 * 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie earns:
2 * ($80 - 25% of $80)
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:

"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Since he traveled for 3 days, we need to convert the days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

"To find the number of bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the middle shelves: 2 middle shelves * 10 books/shelf = 20 books.

The total capacity of all the shelves is: 20 (bottom) + 20 (middle) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of them, as 110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test to pass.

The final answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that b = 5s - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so s + b = 116.

Substituting the expression for b from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:
6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:
6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:
s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:
b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The final answer is: 96"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan started with 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he has 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. He picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble.
5. Now he has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Step 2: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get from potential customers.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers to get 15 customers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 potential customers.
Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated, Jason needs 30 / 1 = 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 potential customers.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total number of flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights for each room and then add them together. Since there are 8 rooms and 2 flashlights per room, the total number of flashlights is 8 * 2 = 16.

To find the total number of candles, we need to calculate the number of small candles and medium candles separately. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. The total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36.

The total number of flashlights and candles is 16 + 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips. 

There are 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110 chips.

Since there are 5 family members, we divide the total number of chips by 5 to find out how many chips each person gets. 

110 chips / 5 people = 22 chips per person.

The final answer is 22."
"To calculate the total time, we need to break down the time taken for each side:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 20 * 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 footballs.

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:
20 = (1/2) * y, where y is the number of robots.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2:
y = 20 * 2
y = 40

So, there are 40 robots.

To find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
40 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 100

The total number of items Dominick saw is 100."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first find out how many minutes he spends on calls per day. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 6 hours by 60 minutes to get 360 minutes per day.

Now, we divide the total minutes per day by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes) to find the number of calls per day. 

360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls per day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5 to find the total number of calls per week.

24 calls per day * 5 days per week = 120 calls per week

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish: 7 minutes per painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes
For the new varnish: 12 minutes per painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Now, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 
72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"To find the total amount of water needed, we need to calculate the water required for each group of plants and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water:
4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

Next, let's calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water:
8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, let's calculate the water needed for the remaining plants. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining plants are 20 - 12 = 8 plants.

Since these plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we can calculate the water needed as follows:
8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the water needed for all the plants:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time spent on land and the time spent in water.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards. 

Time spent on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time spent on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time spent on land = 5 minutes

Time spent in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time spent in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time spent in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time spent on land + Time spent in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

The final answer is 15."
"To find the total number of boxes Bob needs, we need to divide the total number of popsicle sticks required (56) by the number of sticks per box (8).

56 ÷ 8 = 7

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

The total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones.

The main phone costs $20.

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

"To find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of days in June, which is 30 days. 

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we need to convert dozen to individual doughnuts. 1 dozen is equal to 12 doughnuts. 

So, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts per day by the number of days in June: 
120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:
3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200

Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."

"To find John's new speed, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since John can speak 450 words per page, we need to find out how many words he can speak in 1 minute. 

1 minute = 60 seconds
1 minute = 60 seconds * 375 words/minute = 22,500 words

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it would take John to speak 10 pages. 

10 pages * 450 words/page = 4,500 words
Time = Total words / Words per minute
Time = 4,500 words / 22,500 words/minute

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to break down the information given.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the total number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the total number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (5 days). To find the total number of people for these 5 days, we multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 5 = 300.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop.
5. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped: 
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 170 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, 5 gallons will require 5 cups of lemon juice. 

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 5 cups of juice by multiplying 5 cups by 6 lemons per cup. 

5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need 2 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 2 cups of juice by multiplying 2 cups by 6 lemons per cup.

2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon. 

30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

The quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower and the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5:

50% of 36 = 36 * 0.5 = 18

Now, we add the 50% (18) to the number of seeds in the small sunflower (36) to find the number of seeds in the large sunflower:

36 + 18 = 54 seeds

Now, we add the number of seeds in the small sunflower (36) and the large sunflower (54) to find the total number of seeds:

36 + 54 = 90

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we need to first determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can multiply 18 by 3 to find Timothy's total.

18 * 3 = 54

Now that we know Timothy has 54 pens, we can find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide Timothy's total by 2.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

27"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

We know Albert is 36"" tall. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate Anne's height as 2 * 36 = 72"".

We also know that Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so we can calculate Jackie's height as 72 - 2 = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we can calculate her height before summer as 70 - 3 = 67"".

The final answer is 67""."
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the selling price per bar.

Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, in two weeks (14 days), it will produce:
5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

The selling price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is:
70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

The company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To find the total amount Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
Original price of each T-shirt: $8
Number of T-shirts: 2
Discount: 50% off
Price of each T-shirt after discount: $8 * (1 - 0.5) = $4
Total cost of T-shirts: 2 * $4 = $8

For the shoes:
Original price of the shoes: $40
Discount: 40% off
Price of the shoes after discount: $40 * (1 - 0.4) = $24

Total amount Jake spends: $8 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his earnings from completing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 per week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are:
6 * 3 = 18

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of the ice cream cones is:
1.25 * 4 = 5

Now, subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:
18 - 5 = 13

Ryan has $13 left. Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets he can buy with $13. Each ticket costs $6.50, so we can divide the amount of money Ryan has by the cost of a ticket:
13 / 6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add up the costs of the items purchased by Ellen and Lani.

Ellen's purchases:

"To find the total cost of making one jar of the mixture, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients:

- 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey: 2 * $10 = $20
- Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, to find the profit per jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price:
- Profit per jar: $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
- Total profit: $6 * 10 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

- 32 quarters = 32 * $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 * $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31."

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets for herself and her sister: 2 x $7.50 = $15
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total amount spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:
$40 - $27 = $13

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how many days Josh is open in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks and subtract the days he is closed.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are 7 * 2 = 14 days. 

Josh is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, so he is open on 14 - 2 = 12 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, he services 3 * 12 = 36 cars in 2 weeks.

He gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks will be 36 * 4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, let's break down the events:

1. Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.
2. He eats 1 of each flavor for a snack, so he now has:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies
3. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he now has:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
   - 4 sugar cookies (no change)
4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies
5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, so he now has:
   - 6 oatmeal cookies

   - 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Randy now has 6 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies."
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection.

Half of 12 is 6. 

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), Matthew would earn 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), Matthew would earn 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the earnings from both halves: $30 + $42 = $72.

$72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many holes Nate needs to fill.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled per day is:
9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to calculate 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School.

3/4 * 4000 = 3000

Now, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School to find the difference.

4000 - 3000 = 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation: T + B + P = 29.

We know T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Now, we can solve for B: B = 29 - 8 - 16 = 5.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 beakers (7 - 5 = 2).

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of screws needed, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Number of tables: 4
Number of legs per table: 4
Number of screws per leg: 2

Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2 = 32

James has 40 screws. To find the number of screws left over, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

40 - 32 = 8

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: 
$430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds and distances of Aaron and Vanessa.

Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is 'x/2' miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is 'x/2' miles per minute, we can find her time by dividing the distance by her speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (x/2)
Time = 8 / x

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is 'x' miles per minute, we can find his distance by multiplying his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = x * 16

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:

4 = 2 * (x * 16)

Simplifying the equation:

4 = 2x * 16
4 = 32x
x = 4/32
x = 1/8

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's time:

Time = 8 / x
Time = 8 / (1/8)
Time = 8 * 8
Time = 64

The final answer is 64."
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line required for the existing dock

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required.

600 feet of line required - 6 feet of line already available = 594 feet of line needed

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by 2 (since they are open 2 days a week).

Daily revenue:
- 6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals
- 12 meals * $5 per meal = $60
- Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the daily revenue is $60 + $5 = $65

Weekly revenue:
- $65 per day * 2 days per week = $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the total selling price and then divide it by the number of watermelons.

First, we calculate the total selling price:
Total cost price = $80
Profit percentage = 25%
Profit amount = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Total selling price = Total cost price + Profit amount = $80 + $20 = $100

Now, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
Number of watermelons = 50
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. So, her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

2. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

3. We know that John had a son when he was 19, and James is his son. So, John's current age is 18 + 18 = 36 years.

4. The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the youngest son's current age is 36 - 32 = 4 years.

5. In 3 years, the youngest son's age will be 4 + 3 = 7 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference in the number of oranges they peel.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. 

In 1 hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60/3 = 20 oranges, and Jane will peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the cost of the radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

80% of $400 = 0.8 * 400 = $320
$400 - $320 = $80

Now, let's calculate the cost of the labor. 
3 hours * $50 per hour = $150

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor.
$80 + $150 = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of chickens is 'c' and the number of cows is 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

c + b = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can write another equation:

2c + 4b = 70

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2c + 4b = 70
2(c + b) = 2(20)
2c + 2b = 40

Subtracting the two equations:

(2c + 4b) - (2c + 2b) = 70 - 40
2b = 30

Dividing both sides by 2:

b = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'b' into the first equation:

c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.
