"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs she lays and then subtract the eggs she eats and bakes.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.

She bakes 4 eggs for her friends, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.

She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To find the total number of bolts, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fibers separately.

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

"To find the profit, we need to first find the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the increased value, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (which is 100% + 150%).
$80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

The new value of the house is $120,000. 

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.
$120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000

The profit Josh made is $40,000."
"To find the total meters James runs per week, we need to multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance per sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week * Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

The total meters James runs per week is 180."
"To find the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her chickens, we need to add the feed given in the morning and afternoon.

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups

Total feed so far: 15 + 25 = 40 cups

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed, we can find the total amount of feed needed for the day by multiplying the number of chickens by the amount of feed per chicken.

Total feed needed: 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already given 40 cups of feed, we need to subtract that from the total amount of feed needed.

Feed left to give: 60 - 40 = 20 cups

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

Now, let's add the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses:
$5 + $45 = $50.

Kylar needs to pay $50 for 16 glasses."
"To find the number of sheep in each city, we need to follow the given information:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Carla downloads 60% of the file, and the second part where she downloads the remaining 40% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 * 200 = 120 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so the time it takes to download 120 GB is:
120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

However, 20 minutes are spent on the restart, so the actual time spent downloading the first 60% is:
60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so the time it takes to download 80 GB is:
80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the entire file is the sum of the time spent downloading the first 60% and the time spent downloading the remaining 40%:
80 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total distance John traveled, we need to break it down into three parts:

1. The first 3 hours at 60 mph: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. The 2 hours of standstill traffic:
Since he didn't move, the distance is 0 miles.

3. The 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes) at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. The remaining 2.5 hours (4 hours - 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Now, we add up the distances from each part:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 200 = 395 miles

So, John is 395 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings would be:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), her earnings would be:
5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) = 5 * 10 * 1.2 = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month.

Month 1: 60 downloads
Month 2: 3 times the downloads of Month 1 = 3 * 60 = 180 downloads
Month 3: 30% reduction from Month 2 = 180 - (30/100 * 180) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Total downloads over the three months = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = 3 * 68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = 2 * 80 = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

Since the initial cost of the tree is $90, we need to subtract this from the net profit to find the break-even point.

$7.50 (net profit) - $90 (initial cost) = -$82.50 (loss in the first year)

However, this means that in the first year, Carlos will incur a loss. We need to continue calculating the net profit for subsequent years until we reach a positive net profit.

Year 2:
Net profit: $7.50 (previous year) + $10.50 (new income) - $3 (expenses) = $15
Year 3:
Net profit: $15 (previous year) + $10.50 (new income) - $3 (expenses) = $22.50
Year 4:
Net profit: $22.50 (previous year) + $10.50 (new income) - $3 (expenses) = $30

At this point, the net profit is $30, which is greater than the initial cost of the tree ($90). Therefore, Carlos will start earning money on the lemon tree in the 4th year.

Final answer: 4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - x/3 - 2 - (2x - x/6 - 2)/2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/3 + x/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms again:

x - 2x/3 - 3 = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3x - 2x - 9 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 9 = 15

Add 9 to both sides:

x = 24

So Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the best choice for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option.

For the jewelry:
Initial cost: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
Potential value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Initial cost: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
Potential value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Since the potential value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the potential value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

The merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets."
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (westward) and the second day (northward).

Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles on the first day. 

On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since they traveled the same distance, each train covered 150 miles northward.

Now, let's add the distances covered on both days:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, each train covered a total distance of 230 miles in the two days.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

Her annual salary from teaching: 
Number of hours worked per week as a teacher: 35 hours
Number of weeks worked per year: 50 weeks
Annual salary from teaching: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual salary from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Her annual salary from coaching: 
Number of hours worked per week as a coach: 15 hours
Number of weeks worked per year: 50 weeks
Annual salary from coaching: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual salary from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Total annual salary: $35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

$57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 * 7 = 21 eggs per week.

To find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we multiply 21 eggs per week by 4: 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert 84 eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To find the total time Marissa has spent so far, we need to add the time she spent walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles. 

Time spent walking the first 4 miles = 1 hour
Time spent walking the next 2 miles = 1 hour
Total time spent so far = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Since Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can set up an equation to find the total time she needs to spend to achieve this average speed.

Total distance = 12 miles
Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
Total time = Total distance / Desired average speed
Total time = 12 / 4
Total time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, she needs to spend 3 - 2 = 1 hour to achieve her desired average speed.

Now, we need to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters.

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 49/3 - 1 = 48/3 = 16 liters.

The final answer is 16."
"To find the answer, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha was 31. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age to find Raymond's age: 
31 - 6 = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's age at that time: 
25 - 23 = 2

So, Raymond's son was 2 years old when Samantha was 31.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to each group of customers and then add them together.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total.
The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs in total.
The last 3 customers bought 0 DVDs each, so they bought 0 DVDs in total.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of hours the candle burns, we need to calculate the difference between 5:00 PM and 1:00 PM. 

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (1 - 0.25 discount).

Original price = Discounted price / 0.75
Original price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original price = $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she has already ordered.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza she ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of each box of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $49.50
The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50
The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 * $42 = $126

Now, let's add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she will buy and the total cost.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

The cost of each carton is $4.00, so the total cost will be:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance he traveled before his second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B. 

We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the cost of the second pair of heels is 2 * 33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots and the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation:

B + 99 = B - 5

To solve for B, we need to isolate B. 

First, we subtract B from both sides of the equation:

99 = -5

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume their current ages are 7x and 11x, respectively. 

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

Final answer: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to first calculate the number of guesses made by each person.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second person says 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person says 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add the guesses and divide by the number of guesses. 

80 + 60 + 100 = 240

There are 3 guesses. 

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80."
"To find the total hours spent taking care of dogs per day, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
   Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
   Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 
   Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 
4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

The total points scored by Mike is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how much one yogurt costs. 

To do this, we divide the cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the total number of yogurts by the cost of one yogurt: 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how much money John has, we need to calculate the total amount he received from selling his Lego sets and subtract the cost of the video games.

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he received 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 each on 8 video games, so he spent 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games. To find out how much he had initially, we add the money he spent on video games to the money he has left: $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, we subtract the total amount he received from selling the Lego sets from the initial amount he had: $195 - $165 = $30.

Since he initially had $30 and spent $30 on the video games, he must have had $30 initially. 

To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we divide the initial amount by the price of each Lego set: $30 / $15 = 2.

However, we know he had 13 Lego sets initially. The difference between the initial amount and the amount he had after selling the Lego sets is $30. This $30 must be the amount he received from selling the 5 Lego sets he didn't sell.

So, he sold 13 - 5 = 8 Lego sets.

The final answer is 8."
"To find John's running speed, we need to first calculate the total number of hours he runs per week.

He runs 3 hours on the first day, and half as much on the other two days. 
Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. 
So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours per week.

Now, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 / 3 = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels while running and walking. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance run = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance walked = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance run + Distance walked = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is 18."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon while holding the gemstone and still hit it with the javelin.

Let's denote the distance Polly can stand from the dragon while holding the gemstone as x. Since Polly can throw the javelin three times farther when holding the gemstone, the distance the javelin can travel is 3x.

We know that the dragon's reach is 1000 feet, and the javelin can travel 3x feet when Polly holds the gemstone. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 1000

To find x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 1000 / 3
x = 333.33

So, Polly can stand 333.33 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is: 333.33"

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories you can still consume. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. So, you can still consume 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find out how many servings you can have by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving: 0.8 * 300 = 240g.

So, you can eat 240g of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
Number of candles made = 20
Price per candle = $2.00
Total revenue = Number of candles * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
Number of pounds of beeswax and wicks needed = 20 candles / 10 candles per pound
Number of pounds of beeswax and wicks needed = 2 pounds
Cost per pound = $10.00
Total cost = Number of pounds * Cost per pound
Total cost = 2 * $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles written:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes an average of 4 hours to write an article, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we need to subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work from the total number she initially had.

Initial number of Post-it notes = 80
Number of Post-it notes used at work = 220
Number of Post-it notes remaining = 23

Number of Post-it notes in the package = Initial number of Post-it notes - Number of Post-it notes used at work
= 80 - 220
= -140

However, the number of Post-it notes in the package cannot be negative. This is because we cannot have a negative number of Post-it notes. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

Number of Post-it notes used at work = 220
Number of Post-it notes remaining = 23
Number of Post-it notes initially = Number of Post-it notes used at work + Number of Post-it notes remaining
= 220 + 23
= 243

Now, we know the total number of Post-it notes Candice initially had. To find the number of Post-it notes in the package, we subtract the initial number from the total number she initially had.

Number of Post-it notes in the package = Initial number of Post-it notes - Number of Post-it notes initially
= 80 - 243
= -163

However, we still have a negative number. This is because we are subtracting the total number of Post-it notes initially from the total number she initially had. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

Number of Post-it notes used at work = 220
Number of Post-it notes remaining = 23
Number of Post-it notes initially = Number of Post-it notes used at work + Number of Post-it notes remaining
= 220 + 23
= 243

Number of Post-it notes initially = 243
Number of Post-it notes Candice purchased = Number of Post-it notes initially - Number of Post-it notes she already had
= 243 - 80

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought and then calculate the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties he bought by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

200 / 40 = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

40 * 1.5 = 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

10 * 60 = 600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and red ties:

200 + 600 = 800

The final answer is: 800"

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building. 

The total number of units in the building is 15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 
120 - 90 = 30 units.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."

"To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he is traveling at 10 mph, we can find the distance by multiplying the speed by the time. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 * 3 (since he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours)
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we can find the time it takes for him to get back by dividing the distance by his speed on the return trip.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many pounds Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we first need to calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. 

Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:
30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:
7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total amount earned from truck tires and car tires separately.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Since $480 is greater than $520, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $520 = -$40. However, since the question asks for the amount earned on the day with higher revenue, the answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to first find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as follows:

Patchy's kittens = 3 * Trixie's kittens
Patchy's kittens = 3 * 12
Patchy's kittens = 36

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had, and also add the 7 kittens the sisters adopted:

Total kittens = Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens + adopted kittens
Total kittens = 36 + 12 + 7
Total kittens = 55

The Doubtfire family now has 55 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to first find out how many lollipops are left after Jean eats 2.

Initial number of lollipops = 30
Number of lollipops eaten = 2
Number of lollipops left = 30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we can divide the remaining lollipops by 2.

Number of bags = Number of lollipops left / 2
= 28 / 2
= 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: 14"

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a single outing ($14):

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight of a single box = 15 pounds

Maximum weight available for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees are $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual raspberries.

Number of clusters: 6
Number of raspberries per cluster: 20
Total raspberries in clusters: 6 * 20 = 120

Adding the individual raspberries: 120 + 67 = 187

There are 187 raspberries in total."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, we add the number of bad and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 2 (sour) = 3 oranges

Total oranges that are not good = 5 (unripe) + 3 (bad and sour) = 8 oranges

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

1. Cost of material: $500
2. Cost of construction: $800
3. Total cost so far: $500 + $800 = $1300
4. Insurance cost: 10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130
5. Total amount paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430

Janet paid $1430."
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the total amount she receives in the first 20 years and the amount she receives in the remaining 10 years.

In the first 20 years, Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000. So, the total amount she receives in the first 20 years is:

$50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension after 20 years is the initial pension amount plus the total amount she received in the first 20 years:

Value of pension after 20 years = $50,000 + $1,000,000 = $1,050,000

Now, we need to calculate 5% of the value of the pension after 20 years:

5% of $1,050,000 = 0.05 * $1,050,000 = $52,500

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she receives the pension for 10 years. The total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years is:

$52,500/year * 10 years = $525,000

To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we add the total amount she received in the first 20 years and the total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years:

$1,000,000 + $525,000 = $1,525,000

However, this is the total amount she receives in 30 years, not the annual pension. To find the annual pension, we divide the total amount by 30 years:

$1,525,000 / 30 years = $50,833.33

The final answer is $50,833.33."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year (6 months), the cost is $140 per month. 
6 months * $140 per month = $840

For the second half of the year (6 months), the cost is 10% less than $140 per month. 
10% of $140 is $14, so the cost for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
6 months * $126 per month = $756

Now, we add the costs of both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she used to fill it up (4 gallons).

12 gallons (total capacity) ÷ 4 gallons (used) = 3 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 3 gallons. 

To do this, we can divide the miles she has already traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she has left (3 gallons).

100 miles ÷ 3 gallons = 33.33 miles per gallon

Now, we can multiply the miles per gallon by the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

33.33 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 400 miles

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the total hours spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the hours spent each day and then multiply it by 4 weeks.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent on TV and reading per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people, we need to calculate the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and there are 4 schools. So, the total number of teams is 2 * 4 = 8.

Each team has 5 players, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of players is 5 * 8 = 40.

Each team has 1 coach, and there are 8 teams. So, the total number of coaches is 1 * 8 = 8.

Now, we add the total number of teams, players, and coaches to find the total number of people. 
8 (teams) + 40 (players) + 8 (coaches) = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gemstone.

Let's start with the diamonds: 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than diamonds, so the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, let's add up the total number of gems: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

The total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"To find the number of teachers, we need to first find the total number of students. 

Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls: 120 + 60 = 180.

Since there are 5 students per teacher, we divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers: 180 / 5 = 36.

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Weekly allowance: $5
Total weeks: 8

Total amount at the end - Total allowance = Initial amount
$100 - $40 = $60

Bailey started with $60."
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.

She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of classes on weekdays is 5 * 5 = 25 classes.

She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount of money she makes in a week is 495 * 15 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

"To find the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the interest for each month and add it to the cost of the cell phone.

The cost of one cell phone is $150. The interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3.

The total amount Shiela will pay for one cell phone per month is $150 (cost) + $3 (interest) = $153.

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total amount she will pay per month is 5 * $153 = $765.

So, Shiela will pay $765 per month for 3 months.

The final answer is: $765"
"To find the total amount Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then add them together.

"To find the average square footage of each level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half the square footage of the top level, which is 16 / 2 = 8.
The third level will have half the square footage of the second level, which is 8 / 2 = 4.
The fourth level will have half the square footage of the third level, which is 4 / 2 = 2.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels, so we divide the total square footage by 4 to find the average:
30 / 4 = 7.5

The average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the remaining days in the year.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days:
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Since the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, we need to calculate the number of days in a year (365 days) and subtract the initial 180 days:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

Now, let's calculate the amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days:
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, we add the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days and the remaining days:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total amount of dog food used by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Cecilia will use:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry.

Sarah's laundry: 400 pounds
David's laundry: 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 2 to find Raymond's laundry.

Raymond's laundry: 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we can find the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry.

Difference: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both options.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Number of packages needed: 18 / 3 = 6
Total cost: 6 * $2.50 = $15

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Number of packages needed: 18 / 2 = 9
Total cost: 9 * $1 = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

The amount of money saved is: $15 - $9 = $6

Total number of thorns: 75 * 8 = 600

The total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of games lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is 'x + 8'. 

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since the number of games won is 'x + 8', we can substitute x = 7:
x + 8 = 7 + 8
x + 8 = 15

The football team won 15 games.

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing and the number of blocks per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34. So, the number of years he has been vacationing is 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the number of blocks per year is 4. 

The total number of blocks is the product of the number of years and the number of blocks per year. 

Total blocks = 11 years * 4 blocks/year = 44 blocks.

The final answer is 44."
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and add them up.

The first time it rang for 4 times.
The second time it rang for 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang: 
4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after each year.

Year 1: 
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. 

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time is x + 2. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 38

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

So, Gerald's original time was 36 seconds.

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 36 is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6

Adding this to his original time, we get:

36 + 3.6 = 39.6

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds."
"To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to first find the number of cats. 

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2 to find the number of cats: 
60 * 2 = 120 cats

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we need to add the number of dogs and cats and then subtract 12:
60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180
180 - 12 = 168 rabbits

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout

9 hours (Harry's sleep) - 6 hours (James' sleep) = 3 hours.

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to first find out how many ounces of tomatoes she used. Since she lost half of the volume, we can multiply the final volume of the sauce (32 ounces) by 2 to get the original volume of the tomatoes.

32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide the original volume of the tomatoes (64 ounces) by 16 ounces to find out how many cans she used.

64 ounces / 16 ounces = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find out how many tomatoes she used.

4 cans * 3 tomatoes = 12 tomatoes

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x. 

Since 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is (x + 20) - 5.

We also know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is equal to the original number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 20 - 5 = 30 - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 15 = 25

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get: x = 10

Therefore, 10 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the number of plants she will give away:
She will give 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 plants.

Now, let's subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:
98 - 40 = 58

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left after giving 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings: 
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we need to add up the pages from all the textbooks.

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Since he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we need to divide the remaining pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he needs to read per day:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately.

On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of soda for dinner, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the rate at which it covers the distance.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 42 / 3 * 10
Time = 14 * 10
Time = 140 minutes

The fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to first calculate the total time he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours in total.
On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time he watched on these days: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, we need to subtract the time he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total time to find out how much time he watched on Wednesday.

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. To do this, we'll divide the total minutes by 30: 90 / 30 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to make twice as many, so he will bake 2x cookies.

However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

He drops 5 cookies, so he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Now, subtract the cashback amount from the total cost:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each person.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Since they both ate their entire amount, we add the total number of roll-ups:
48 + 42 = 90

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2:
90 / 2 = 45

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45."
"To find the rate at which the boat is taking on water, we need to first find the rate at which Julia rows. 

Since Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, her rowing speed is 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can find the rate at which the boat takes on water as follows:

Rate of water intake = 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters per foot

Now, we can find the total distance Julia rows to reach the shore:

Distance = 20 feet (initial distance) + 64 feet (remaining distance) = 84 feet

Since Julia rows at a speed of 1.25 feet per second, the time it takes her to row 84 feet is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 84 feet / 1.25 feet/second = 67.2 seconds

Since the boat takes on water at a rate of 0.2 liters per foot, the total amount of water taken on is:

Total water intake = Rate of water intake * Time = 0.2 liters/foot * 84 feet = 16.8 liters

The final answer is: 16.8"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks as 'x'. 

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the equation:

6 * Brittany's phone capacity = 1800

To find Brittany's phone capacity, we divide both sides by 6:

Brittany's phone capacity = 1800 / 6
Brittany's phone capacity = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks. We can set up the equation:

Brittany's phone capacity = 50 * x

Since we know Brittany's phone capacity is 300, we can set up the equation:

300 = 50 * x

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
10 boards * $10 per board = $100

To find the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 
5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards: 
$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, we need to calculate the new selling price. 
The original price was $10 per board, so the new price is $10 + 50% of $10, which is $10 + $5 = $15 per board.

Now, we multiply the new selling price by the total number of boards: 
(10 + 5) boards * $15 per board = 15 boards * $15 per board = $225

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price: 
$225 - $180 = $45

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to first find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day.

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:
30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day:
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago and then calculate their current salaries.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3(Lylah's salary)
$40,000 = 1.3(Lylah's salary)

To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can divide both sides by 1.3:
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30,769.23

Now, we know Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his current salary:
Adrien's current salary = Adrien's salary four years ago + 40% of Adrien's salary four years ago
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + 0.4($40,000)
Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + $16,000
Adrien's current salary = $56,000

Now, we can find their total salary four years later:
Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $30,769.23
Total salary = $86,769.23

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of:
10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. So, she covers a distance of:
5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances covered in both parts:
30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many letters Jennie put stamps on. 

Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of letters needing stamps = 60
One-third of the letters needing stamps = 60 / 3 = 20

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters.

Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. 

To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to subtract the number of letters Jennie put stamps on from the current number of letters in the pile:

Initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters = Current number of letters in the pile - Number of letters Jennie put stamps on
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as 'x'. 

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. Then she bought a package of 'x' spoons, so she had x spoons. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so now she had x + 5 spoons.

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she was left with x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons.

We are told that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. This means that x + 2 = 12.

To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation x + 2 = 12.

x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Total cost of doctors' time:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write an equation: W = 2B.

We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write another equation: B = 2Q.

Now, we know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get: 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Substituting the second equation into the previous equation, we get: 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200.

Each client needs 1 pack of cloths, so 8 clients will need 8 packs of cloths. 
Each pack of cloths costs $5, so 8 packs will cost 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses = cost of bleach + cost of cloths
Total expenses = $32 + $40
Total expenses = $72

Total income = $92
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by 4 since he harvests every 3 months.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John harvests every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4:
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of legos, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the total number of pieces: 
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the initial 30 bees return, which is 30 * 1/2 = 15 bees.

So, after the first 12 hours, the total number of bees that have left is 30 + 15 = 45 bees.

In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to find out how many bees that left before that hadn't already returned. Since 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees left in the first 12 hours. 

In the next 6 hours, 60 bees leave, but 15 of them are the ones that left in the first 12 hours and had already returned. So, 60 - 15 = 45 bees leave in the next 6 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many bees return in the last 6 hours. We know that 15 bees returned in the first 12 hours, and 45 bees left in the first 12 hours. So, 15 + 45 = 60 bees that left in the first 12 hours had already returned. 

In the last 6 hours, 45 bees leave, and 60 bees that left before that hadn't already returned return. So, 60 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is:
$12 (adult) + $10 (child) = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount of money she gave the cashier is:
$22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many friends Dorothy has, and then multiply that number by 4 to find James' number of friends.

Since Charlie has 3 times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can divide 12 by 3 to find Dorothy's number of friends.

12 / 3 = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Now, since James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy, we can multiply Dorothy's number of friends by 4 to find James' number of friends.

4 * 4 = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

"To find the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to convert the distance to the same units as the speed. Since the speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distance to feet.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. The time Tim will be waiting is the difference between their times:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire.

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To find the total number of cookies Carl bought, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Since each cookie costs $0.10, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change:
$10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. The total fries eaten so far are 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) = 21 fries.
4. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
5. The total fries eaten so far are 21 (previous) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
6. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * (30 - 2) = 2/3 * 28 = 18.67 fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 18 fries.
7. The total fries eaten so far are 30 (previous) + 18 (raccoon) = 48 fries.
8. The ants ate 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Now, let's find the initial number of fries in the pack. We know that 5 fries were left after all the animals ate. So, the initial number of fries is 5 (remaining) + 48 (eaten) = 53 fries.

Final answer: 53"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of day and then add them together.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 of these days in a week, the total hours for these days is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

Now, we need to calculate the total hours for the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in a semester, so we multiply the weekly hours by 16:

9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
8 hours/week * 16 weeks = 128 hours

Now, we add the total hours for both types of days:

144 hours + 128 hours = 272 hours

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

The total length of the rolls is 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

The total length of the croissants is 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

The total length of the baguettes is 60 baguettes * 24 inches/foot * 2 feet/baguette = 2880 inches.

Now, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the total length by 12.

Total length in inches = 1200 + 720 + 2880 = 4800 inches.
Total length in feet = 4800 inches / 12 = 400 feet.

"To find the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes for 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required for all the apes:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the total distance each person ran, we need to calculate the distance Blake ran and the distance Kelly ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, he covers the entire length of the field twice. So, the total distance Blake ran is 2 * 100 yards = 200 yards.

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance from the 100-yard line to the 40-yard line is 60 yards. Since she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 60 yards twice. So, the total distance Kelly ran is 60 yards * 2 * 34 = 408 yards.

Now, we can compare the distances. Blake ran 200 yards, and Kelly ran 408 yards. Since 408 yards is greater than 200 yards, Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract the distance Blake ran from the distance Kelly ran: 408 yards - 200 yards = 208 yards.

The winner ran 208 yards farther than the loser."

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles.
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so we add them to the initial number: 11 + 6 = 17
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we subtract them from the total: 17 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The tank had 17 feet of water on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. 
   To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.
   24 * (2/3) = 48/3 = 16 feet.

The tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

"To calculate the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every 2 months.

Initial price = $20
Increase after 2 months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
Price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

Increase after 4 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
Price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Increase after 6 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
Price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

Increase after 8 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.91
Price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.91 = $41.47

Increase after 10 months = 20% of $41.47 = 0.20 * $41.47 = $8.29
Price after 10 months = $41.47 + $8.29 = $49.76

Increase after 12 months = 20% of $49.76 = 0.20 * $49.76 = $9.95
Price after 12 months = $49.76 + $9.95 = $59.71

Increase after 14 months = 20% of $59.71 = 0.20 * $59.71 = $11.94
Price after 14 months = $59.71 + $11.94 = $71.65

Increase after 16 months = 20% of $71.65 = 0.20 * $71.65 = $14.33
Price after 16 months = $71.65 + $14.33 = $85.98

Increase after 18 months = 20% of $85.98 = 0.20 * $85.98 = $17.20
Price after 18 months = $85.98 + $17.20 = $103.18

Increase after 20 months = 20% of $103.18 = 0.20 * $103.18 = $20.64
Price after 20 months = $103.18 + $20.64 = $123.82

Increase after 22 months = 20% of $123.82 = 0.20 * $123.82 = $24.76
Price after 22 months = $123.82 + $24.76 = $148.58

Increase after 24 months = 20% of $148.58 = 0.20 * $148.58 = $29.72
Price after 24 months = $148.58 + $29.72 = $178.30

Increase after 26 months = 20% of $178.30 = 0.20 * $178.30 = $35.66
Price after 26 months = $178.30 + $35.66 = $213.96

"To find the cost of each toy, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.

We also know that one red car costs $4, so R = 4.

Now, we need to find the cost of an action figure. We can use the fact that one red car costs $4 and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures to set up an equation:

R = 4 = 3A

Now, we can solve for A:

4 = 3A
A = 4/3
A = 1.33

Now that we know the cost of an action figure, we can find the cost of the doll:

D = 3A
D = 3(1.33)
D = 4

Now, we can find the total cost of all the toys:

Total cost = 5R + 3A + D
Total cost = 5(4) + 3(1.33) + 4
Total cost = 20 + 4 + 4
Total cost = 28

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which means she would lose $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

Now, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income she would have made by doing her taxes herself: $105 - $90 = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. 

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation: S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B + 2, respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Now, we can substitute S = 2B into the second equation: 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B: S = 2 * 8 = 16.

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and Sally Thirty-two (8).

The total age of the four birds is 8 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 51.

Minimum payment for student loans: $300
Minimum payment for credit card: $200
Minimum payment for mortgage: $500
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500

Now, let's add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:
Total monthly payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds
Total time to peel and cut one potato: 1.5 + 5 = 6.5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by 60:
60 * 6.5 = 390 seconds

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
390 / 60 = 6.5 minutes

So, it will take Billy 6.5 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to first calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Let's start with the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and profit is the difference between revenue and cost, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10x - Cost = $25

We know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon, the cost per glass is $5 / 20 = $0.25.

Now, we can calculate the total cost per gallon:
Cost per gallon = $0.25 * 20 = $5

Now we can rewrite the equation:
$10x - $5x = $25
$5x = $25
x = $5

This means they made 5 gallons of lemonade. Now, we can calculate the total cost of lemons:
Total cost of lemons = $5 * 5 = $25

The final answer is: $25"

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

Total earnings for the first two weeks = $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. 

Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can multiply the total number of students who voted (80) by 3/4.

Number of votes the winner got = 80 * (3/4) = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the difference between the total number of votes and the number of votes the winner got.

Number of votes the loser got = Total number of votes - Number of votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of white carnations. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. 

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation: 
5x = 200
x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. We know Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. 
   Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15 years.
   Mark was 5 years older than that, so Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old two years ago.
3. Since Mark is now 2 years older than Jean, we can find Jean's age by subtracting 2 from Mark's current age.
   Mark's current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years.
   Jean's age is 22 - 2 = 20 years.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together.

The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The well-rounded team runs 55 seconds per leg, so their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in their times is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3, and then subtract that from 1.

The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 is 3/6, since there are 3 favorable outcomes (1, 2, and 3) out of 6 possible outcomes.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1 - 3/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4.

Now, we can find the difference in probability:

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 - Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/4) * 100 = 25%.

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: 25%"
"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first find out how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's apples as follows:

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of straw pieces used for the rats, we need to subtract the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used.

Total straw used for hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50
Total straw used for rabbits = 20
Total straw used for rats = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the total straw used for rats by 3 to find the number of straw pieces per cage.

Straw pieces per cage = 90 / 3 = 30

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the straw pieces per cage by 6 to find the number of rats in each cage.

Number of rats in each cage = 30 / 6 = 5"
"To calculate the interest, we need to first find the interest for one month. 

Interest for one month = Principal * Rate
Interest for one month = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2

Since Mandy paid the amount after 3 months, we need to find the total interest for 3 months.

Total interest = Interest for one month * Number of months
Total interest = $2 * 3
Total interest = $6

Now, we need to add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.

Amount to be paid = Principal + Total interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the total cost of the bags, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue. 

Total revenue = Number of bags * Selling price per bag
Total revenue = Number of bags * $30
Total revenue = $400
Number of bags = $400 / $30
Number of bags = 13.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 13 bags.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 13 * $20
Total cost = $260

Now, let's add the transportation cost:
Total cost = Total cost + Transportation cost
Total cost = $260 + $2 * 13
Total cost = $260 + $26
Total cost = $286

Now, let's find the number of bags the trader bought:
Number of bags bought = Total revenue - Total cost
Number of bags bought = $400 - $286
Number of bags bought = 114

The trader bought 114 bags."
"To find out how much they spent on food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Total cost of tickets and food = Cost of tickets + Cost of food
Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75
Total cost of tickets and food = $36.00

They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

Total cost = Total cost of tickets and food + Total cost of rides
Total cost = $36.00 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find out how much each of them paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to multiply the number of peaches he collects per minute by the number of minutes he collects.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

Total amount of insects per week = 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week = 7

Insects per day = Total amount of insects per week / Number of days in a week
Insects per day = 3.5 / 7
Insects per day = 0.5 pounds

The ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom plants and chops down each year, and then subtract the total number of trees that die after 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in the number of trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8.

After 10 years, the total number of trees planted is 10 * 10 = 100.

The total number of trees chopped down is 2 * 10 = 20.

The total number of trees that die is 30% of the initial number of trees, which is 0.3 * 50 = 15.

The total number of trees left is the initial number of trees minus the number of trees chopped down and the number of trees that die: 50 - 20 - 15 = 15.

So, Tom has 15 trees left.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. 
   So, the remaining number of pink flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.
3. The neighbors painted 6 flamingos white and put them back out, so now there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
4. On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   Now, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.
   The total number of white flamingos is still 6.
5. To find the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we need to subtract the total pounds of carrots distributed from the total pounds of carrots available.

Total pounds of carrots available = 200 pounds
Number of restaurants = 40
Pounds of carrots per restaurant = 2 pounds

Total pounds of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds of carrots per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total pounds of carrots distributed from the total pounds of carrots available:
200 - 80 = 120

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
   So, now she has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
   So, now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (20 + 60) = 2 * 80 = 160 cards.
   So, now she has 120 + 160 = 280 cards.

"To find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher, we need to divide the total number of sentences by 2, since he edits an equal number for both publishers.

1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences per publisher

Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, we multiply the number of sentences by the rate:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we multiply the amount Mark earns from Publisher A by 2:

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of what he earns from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his weekly earnings, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

John's weekly earnings: $2000
Number of weeks in a year: 52

Weekly earnings for the year: $2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's calculate the monetary reward from the award: 
$5000

Total earnings for the year: $104,000 + $5000 = $105,000

The 5% raise is not directly applicable to the monetary reward, but it's a raise in his salary. To calculate the raise, we need to know his original salary before the award. Since we don't have that information, we can't calculate the exact raise amount.

However, we can calculate his total earnings including the raise. Assuming the 5% raise is applied to his original salary, we can estimate his new salary as follows:
Original salary: $2000 * 52 = $104,000
5% raise: $104,000 * 0.05 = $5200
New salary: $104,000 + $5200 = $105,520

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year with the raise:
$105,520 * 52 = $5,494,240

Since the award was received on the first day of the year, it's not included in the 52 weeks of salary. So, we can add the monetary reward to his total earnings:
$5,494,240 + $5000 = $5,498,240

The final answer is: $5,498,240"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced and then multiply it by the number of barrels per ton.

First, we multiply the number of acres by the number of tons per acre:
10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we multiply the total tons by the number of barrels per ton:
50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, for 3 days, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

"To find the required score, we need to first find the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93. 

Since there are 6 tests, the total score required for an average of 93 is 93 * 6 = 558.

We know Brinley's scores for the first 5 tests: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

The sum of these scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 358.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the given scores. The lowest score is 71.

To find the required score for the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first 5 scores (excluding the lowest score) from the total required score: 
558 - (358 - 71) = 558 - 287 = 271.

So, Brinley needs a score of 271 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. 
There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. 
   The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

2. Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
   So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

3. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 
   Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn for the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already had $10 saved, so she needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $40, we can divide $40 by $5, which is 8 sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. Let's assume she mows the lawn x times. The total amount she earns from babysitting is $5 * 8 = $40. The total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4x.

Since she needs to earn a total of $40, we can set up the equation: $40 = $40 + $4x.

Subtracting $40 from both sides, we get $0 = $4x.

Dividing both sides by $4, we get x = 0.

However, this doesn't make sense, as she needs to mow the lawn at least once to earn some money. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Since she earns $5 per babysitting session, she can earn $40 in 8 sessions. However, she also needs to earn $4x from mowing the lawn. We can set up the equation: $40 = $5 * 8 + $4x.

Subtracting $40 from both sides, we get $0 = $4x.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs collected is 3r + 5w.

We are given that the total number of eggs collected is 42. So, we can set up the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can divide the total distance by his speed to find the time spent walking.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the number of customers on the first two days.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers on the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.

Since the total number of customers by the third day was 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.

500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost from the small pool in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. The amount of water lost from the big pool in 4 minutes is also 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This means the current amount of water in the big pool is 4 times the current amount of water in the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as y gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

Since the big pool initially had 2x gallons and lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16. We know this is equal to 4y, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons and lost 16 gallons, so the current amount of water in the small pool is y = x - 16.

Substituting y = x - 16 into the equation 2x - 16 = 4y, we get:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 16 to both sides, we get:

2x = 4x - 48

Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get:

-2x = -48

Dividing both sides by -2, we get:

x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation y = x - 16:

y = 24 - 16
y = 8

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. 

Total cost of shoes and belt = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

$352.00"
"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay and subtract it from the initial amount.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
10% of $2000 is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

So, the total amount she needs to return is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

She will pay $165 per month for 12 months. 
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to return:
$2200 - $1980 = $220.

Janeth's remaining balance will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias.

"To find the current ages of Adrian and Zack, we need to calculate their ages based on the given information.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. We add 3 to each of their current ages.
Adrian's age in 3 years = Adrian's current age + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3
Adrian's age in 3 years = 66

Zack's age in 3 years = Zack's current age + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3
Zack's age in 3 years = 45

Harriet's age in 3 years = Harriet's current age + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3
Harriet's age in 3 years = 24

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (Adrian's age in 3 years + Zack's age in 3 years + Harriet's age in 3 years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 45 + 24) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points of the three students who have scores: 
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's score by subtracting the total points scored by the other three students from the total points:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

The final answer is 54."

New total cards = 82 + 14 = 96

Now, we need to find the number of water type cards. 
New water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to add their individual rates. 

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, so her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it takes to complete the puzzle.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 30% of them were ready for harvest, so we need to find 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially. 

Now, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest this time. 

To find the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons.

84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages:
20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

The final answer is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A:
1000 - 300 = 700 students

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:
700 - 420 = 280 students

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has and then compare it to John's and James' candies.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can divide John's candies by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has.

John has 54 candies, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, we can compare John's and James' candies. John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' candies from John's candies.

54 - 33 = 21

John has 21 more candies than James."
"To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to add the number of books each person has and the number of books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read 2 + 2 = 4 books in total.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read 1 + 1 = 2 books in total.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

"To find the total number of letters Mike writes per week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he receives and sends.

He receives 3 letters per week (5 - 2 = 3) and sends 3 letters per week (he stopped being penpals with 2 people, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 people left).

Since each letter is 5 pages long, he receives 3 * 5 = 15 pages per week and sends 3 * 5 = 15 pages per week.

Since he writes a page every 6 minutes, he writes 15 pages per week. To find the total time spent writing, we multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write one page: 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

The final answer is: 1.5"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to first calculate the total minutes he used for his daily call with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used and the extra minutes from the total minutes in the plan:
1000 minutes - 450 minutes - 300 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is 14."
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

Total hours worked per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Total cost before discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Discount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first find the total cost of all the party supplies. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total.

"To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to multiply her sister's cookies by 4. 
Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Calories difference = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of girls as follows:

Total number of girls = 50% of 3 classes
= 0.5 * 3
= 1.5 classes

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls in the school is:
1.5 classes * 20 students/class = 30 girls

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the number of girls in the third class is:
30 girls - 15 girls - 12 girls = 3 girls

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of boys:
30 boys - 3 girls = 27 boys

The final answer is 27."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars the previous night. 

So, the number of cougars Rick killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals Rick killed. He killed 10 wolves the previous night, 15 cougars the previous night, 36 wolves today, and 12 cougars today.

Total number of animals killed = 10 + 15 + 36 + 12 = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first find out how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to find out how many cows are in each stall after Mr. Sylas buys and divides the new cows.

Initially, there were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240.

Now, he divides the 240 cows equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows are in each stall, we divide 240 by 20:

240 / 20 = 12

So, each stall now has 12 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8:

12 * 8 = 96

Therefore, there are 96 cows in 8 of the stalls."

"To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to first find the total weight of the wood. 

Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections: 
200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the wood:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to find 30% of 8000 pounds:
30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the wood:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has and then add the number of fruits Andrea has.

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from 52:
Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas:
Total fruits = 52 (Andrea's apples) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) + 44 (Jamal's apples) = 144

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we'll divide the total number of cookies by 12:

66 cookies / 12 = 5.5 dozen

Now, we multiply the number of dozen by 2 cups to find the total cups of flour needed:

5.5 dozen * 2 cups/dozen = 11 cups

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we need to first find the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 
So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the number of stitches for the two sleeves is 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:

In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10 and Marco's age will be m + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (m + 10) = M + m + 20.

Since M + m = 20, we can substitute this into the equation: 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Ruby's current age be R and Sam's current age be S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: R = 6S.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the total length of the space between the gemstones, we need to subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace. 

There are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, so the total length of the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

Now, subtract the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to divide the remaining space by 0.25 to find the number of beads: 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we need to double the number of stories each of them wrote in the first week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week, he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week, she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add up the total number of stories they wrote in the second week:
40 (Alani) + 80 (Braylen) + 120 (Margot) = 240 stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we need to add the stories from the first and second week:
20 (Alani) + 40 (Braylen) + 60 (Margot) = 120 stories in the first week.
Adding this to the 240 stories from the second week:
120 + 240 = 360 stories.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the brother's current age, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 

Ann's brother's current age = 2 * 9 = 18 years

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.

Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we need to first find the total number of stars on the flag. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The remaining stars are 76 - (24 + 12) = 40 stars. 

Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we can divide the remaining stars by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars. 
40 / 5 = 8 rows of 5 stars.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the flagstones, we need to multiply the number of flagstones by their individual weight.

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight per flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals given out for counting as 'x'. 

Since Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that 39 is 10 times less than 'x'. 

So, we can set up the equation: 39 = 10x/10.

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 10: 
39 * 10 = 10x
390 = 10x

Now, we divide both sides by 10:
390 / 10 = x
x = 39

The number of medals given out for counting is 39."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are available, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars. 

There are 4 adults and 8 children, so the total number of people is 4 + 8 = 12. 

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars."
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals she works. 150 / 10 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of 10-minute intervals by her earnings per interval. 15 * $5 = $75.

The final answer is $75."
"To find the initial points of each player, we need to calculate:

- Mike's points: 21
- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18
- Tony's points: 21 * 2 = 42

Now, let's check if each player has over 20 points. 
- Mike: 21 > 20, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim: 18 < 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony: 42 > 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim: 18
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add the points of all three players to find the total:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is 83."
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to first determine how many oranges the sons washed.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges.
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity for each day and then add them together.

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370."
"To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam sold in total, we need to add the number of crates he sold on each day.

On Monday and Friday, he was closed, so he didn't sell any crates.
On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
On the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Since his target was 120 crates, we need to subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

Difference = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carmen spent on the desk. 

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time. Since there were 3 other people who bid once, the bids rose 3 times. 

The initial bid was $200. After the first bid, the price became $250. After the second bid, the price became $300. After the third bid, the price became $350. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids at $250, $300, and $350. 

The total amount of money Carmen spent on the desk is the sum of the initial bid and the 3 bids she made: $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total distance driven per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year. 

Since John goes to work and back each day, the total distance driven per day is 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles. 

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 

Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of driving. The cost of driving is $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000.

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800.

The total cost of driving per year is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to first find the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

Monday's exercise time: 16 minutes
Sunday's exercise time: 23 minutes
Total exercise time on Monday and Sunday: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we multiply the total exercise time by 2.

Total exercise time on Tuesday: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the folded paper.

When a tabloid is folded, the number of pages on the left side (front and back) is equal to the number of pages on the right side (front and back). 

In this case, we have 2 pages on the left side (page 1 and page 2) and 2 pages on the right side (page 31 and page 32). 

Since the paper is folded, we need to count the number of pages on both sides of the fold. 

So, the total number of pages on one side of the fold is 2 (left side) + 2 (right side) = 4 pages.

Since there are 2 sides to the fold, we need 2 sets of 4 pages, which is 2 * 4 = 8 pages.

However, we also need to include the original page 1 and page 32, which are not part of the folded pages. 

So, the total number of pages used is 8 (folded pages) + 2 (original pages) = 10 pages.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent.

She spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides.

Total amount spent = $25 + $10 = $35

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had:
$50 - $35 = $15

Annika has $15 left.

$15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first find out how many books she sold in the second year.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. So, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that she has 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We already know that she sold 90 books in the first year, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: 2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:
10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for April would be:
$100/day * 30 days = $3000

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the whole month. So, his total earnings for April would be:
$3000 + $300 = $3300

The final answer is: $3300"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20 * 0.2 (since 80% is the same as 0.8). 

20 * 0.8 = 16

So, John lost to 16 people."
"To find the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 
   Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

2. Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves

3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:
   Half of the remaining loaves = (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can divide 8 by 4 to find the weight Joey loses per week.

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can multiply the number of weeks by the weight lost per week.

2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

"To determine the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs the person will grow in 15 days.

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, we divide 15 by 3 to find the number of extra arms: 15 / 3 = 5.

Since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, we divide 15 by 5 to find the number of extra legs: 15 / 5 = 3.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs: 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip and subtract the amount he wants to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits: 
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket: 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: 
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract that from the total cost of the trip: 
$1950 - $2000 = -$50

However, since you can't spend a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the calculation. Let's recheck the cost of the flight ticket. 
The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than that = $500 + $700 = $1200

However, we can see that the flight ticket is actually $200 less than 6 times the cost of a business suit. 
6 times the cost of a business suit = 6 * $100 = $600
$600 - $700 = -$100

Now, let's recalculate the total cost of the trip: 
$600 + $150 + $100 = $850

Since Theo wants to save $2000, we subtract that from the total cost of the trip: 
$850 - $2000 = -$1150

However, we can see that the total cost of the trip is less than the amount he wants to save. This means that Theo won't be able to afford the trip as planned."
"To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person eats in a week and then add them up.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.
The rest of the family (2 people) eat 2 eggs each day, so they eat 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Total eggs per day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is:
13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we need to follow the given information:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can find Noah's age six years ago by dividing Cera's age by 2.

Noah's age six years ago = Cera's age six years ago = 46 / 2 = 23

2. Now, we can find Noah's current age by adding 6 to his age six years ago.

Noah's current age = 23 + 6 = 29

3. We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, we can find the population of Chile six years ago by multiplying Noah's age by 3000.

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago = 3000 * 23 = 69000

4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can find the current population by multiplying the population six years ago by 2.

Population of Chile now = 2 * Population of Chile six years ago = 2 * 69000 = 138000

The population of Chile now is 138000."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We know that the total number of players is 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

7x = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we need to calculate the number of people in each group and add them together.

There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people.
There are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party."
"To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. 
   Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 
   2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
   So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 
   Total marbles Solomon has now is 20 + 8 = 28.

2. Now, add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him. 
   Total marbles = 50 (from the store) + 28 (from Solomon and his father) = 78.

3. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight. 
   Total weight = 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = Length * Width * Depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total number of children, we need to first find the number of girls and nongendered children.

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

Since the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to first find the number of electric poles. 

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. 

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x. 

Since the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the equation: 
3x = 45

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the number of electric poles required is 15.

15"
"To find the total number of people at the party, we need to add the number of men and women.

Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10 people

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:
Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3 men

Now, we know that 3 men left, and 10 people in total left. Since we know that 3 men left, the number of women who left is:
Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7 women

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:
Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8 women

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The book costs $4.
2. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

"To find the total number of pencils, we need to add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, but we don't know how many pencils are in each box. Let's call the number of pencils in each box 'x'. 

So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2.

Meg has 46 pencils.

The total number of pencils is 3x + 2 + 46.

Since the total number of pencils is 26, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2 + 46 = 26

Combine the constants:
3x + 48 = 26

Subtract 48 from both sides:
3x = -22

Divide both sides by 3:
x = -22/3

Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, this doesn't make sense in this context. However, we can try to find a whole number solution by re-examining the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, and the total number of pencils is 26. We can try to find a whole number solution by assuming that the number of pencils in each box is a whole number.

Let's try x = 8. Then, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3(8) + 2 = 26.

So, Jam has 8 pencils in each box.

Now, we can find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have:
Jam has 3(8) + 2 = 26 pencils
Meg has 46 pencils
Total pencils = 26 + 46 = 72

To find the total number of boxes needed, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box:
72 / 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the cooling effect of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes used:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we multiply the number of ice cubes by 12:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

Now, let's calculate the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. The cream makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

The total weakening effect is the sum of the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the effect of adding cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

So, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

Final answer: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many new records the 5 people got in total. Since they left with 7 new records, and they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, we can set up an equation.

Let's say the total number of old records they brought in is x.

Since they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of new records they got is x/2.

We know that the total number of new records they got is 7, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 7

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 7 * 2
x = 14

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees after subtracting the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people heading to the third stop.

First, let's find the total number of people who got on the bus at the first and second stops. 
At the first stop, 5 people got on. 
At the second stop, 8 people got on. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the first and second stops is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, we know that 20 people were heading to the third stop. Since 7 people got off at the second stop, we need to add those 7 people to the total number of people who got on the bus at the first and second stops. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 13 + 7 = 20.

However, we are asked to find the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, not the total number of people who got on the bus at the first and second stops. Since 7 people got off at the second stop, we need to subtract those 7 people from the total number of people heading to the third stop. 
So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 20 - 7 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total time it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes = 40 / 1 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the steps:

1. Erin starts with 7 lollipops.
2. Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops, so now Erin has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so now Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned: The customer spent $80 and gets $1 off for every $20 spent. So, they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. The rewards are worth $1 each, so they earned 4 * $1 = $4.

2. Calculate the total discount: The customer used their rewards and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. The rewards were worth $4, so the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

3. Calculate the final price: The customer spent $43 initially, and the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12. So, the final price is $43 - $12 = $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip."
"To determine the net pay for Job A, we need to calculate the total tax amount first. 

Total tax for Job A = 20% of $15 * 2000 hours = 0.2 * 15 * 2000 = $6000
Net pay for Job A = $15 * 2000 - $6000 = $30,000

For Job B, we need to calculate the net income first. 

Net income for Job B = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Tax on net income for Job B = 10% of $36,000 = 0.1 * 36,000 = $3600
Net pay for Job B = $36,000 - $3600 = $30,600

Comparing the net pay for both jobs, Job A has a higher net pay rate. To find the difference, we subtract the lower net pay from the higher net pay.

Difference in net pay = $30,600 - $30,000 = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we need to calculate the number of ruined castles first. 

40% of 220 castles are ruins. 
40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
New value of each share after the first year: $8 + $4 = $12

Decrease in the second year: 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New value of each share after the second year: $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. 

Since the two larger groups are equal in number, each of them has 200 - x students. 

We are given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. So, we can set up the equation:

200 - x = x - 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 = 2x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

210 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

105 = x

So, the smallest group has 105 students.

105"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows. 

Let's say the number of cows is x. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2x.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"

"To find the weight of each animal, we can use the given information:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
Container weight: 20 pounds
Pink frog: 50 pounds
Blue beetle: 50 pounds
Green toad: 50 pounds
Yellow snake: 60 pounds
Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight = 20 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 210 pounds"

Daily revenue from tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000
Daily revenue from silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100

Total daily revenue: $1000 + $1100 = $2100

Now, let's find the percentage increase in daily revenue:
Percentage increase = ((New revenue - Old revenue) / Old revenue) * 100

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once. So, the cost of mini-golf is $5.
The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice. So, the cost of the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.
The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5 = $30.

Now, we subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will also need to pay for their own activities, we need to divide the remaining budget by the cost per person. However, we don't know the cost per person yet. We know that the total cost of the activities is $30, and we want to find out how many friends she can invite.

Let's assume the cost per person is x. Then, the total cost of the activities for n friends will be $30n. Since each friend will pay for their own activities, the total cost for n friends is equal to the cost per person times the number of friends.

We can set up the equation: $30n = x * n

Since we don't know the cost per person, we can't find the exact number of friends. However, we can express the number of friends in terms of the cost per person.

Let's assume the cost per person is x. Then, the number of friends is $90 / x.

To find the maximum number of friends, we can try different values of x. Since the cost per person is likely to be less than $5 (the cost of a round of mini-golf), let's try x = 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For x = 1, the number of friends is $90 / $1 = 90.
For x = 2, the number of friends is $90 / $2 = 45.
For x = 3, the number of friends is $90 / $3 = 30.
For x = 4, the number of friends is $90 / $4 = 22.5.

Since we can't invite a fraction of a person, the maximum number of friends Morgan can invite is 22.

The final answer is 22."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is also $2. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, we know that the total amount of money Billy had initially was $10, and he spent $8 on gumballs. So, the amount of money he spent on candy is $10 - $8 = $2.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought by dividing the amount of money he spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5). 

$2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

So, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S.

We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We also know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, so we can write the equation as:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find S:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to calculate the distance from the first city to the third city. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled per day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the answer as a decimal.

The train goes between services approximately 0.0375 days per trip, but since it does 3 trips a day, we can calculate the total number of days between services as follows:

1 / 0.0375 = 26.67 days

So, the train goes between services approximately 26.67 days."

Total time = Time taken to drive to his friend's house + Time taken for the detour + Time taken to drive back home
Total time = 2.86 + 0.14 + 3 = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: 5.99"
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

Total students = 96
Absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Number of boys present = Total students - Absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

The final answer is 87."
"To find the number of boys, we need to multiply the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we add the number of girls and boys to find the total number of kids in the park.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. 
2. The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5.
3. The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3(4x - 5).
4. The total number of people kicked out is 50.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms again:

17x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

17x = 70

Divide both sides by 17:

x = 4

Now that we know x, we can find the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Number of customers kicked out for shoplifting: 4x - 5 = 4(4) - 5 = 11
Number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale: 3(4x - 5) = 3(4) - 15 = 3

Now, we can find the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks:

Number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks: x = 4

To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total:

50 - 4 - 11 - 3 = 32

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 32."
"To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to first find out how many points Sara had. 

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation: 
Erin's points = 3 * Sara's points
14 = 3 * 8
14 = 24

However, this is not correct. Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

Let Sara's points be x. Then Erin's points will be 3x. We know Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:
3x = 14
x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

Since Sara scored 8 points, Erin scored 3 times more points than Sara. So, Erin scored 3 * 8 = 24 points. 

To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to subtract 14 from 24.
24 - 14 = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of gift and add them together.

1. Picture frames: 44 seniors * $20 per frame = $880
   Since each frame needs to be etched with a logo, we need to add 20% of the cost of the frame. 
   20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4
   So, the total cost of the picture frames with etching is $880 + $4 = $884

2. Pins: 2 seniors * $5 per pin = $10

3. Cords for officers: 1/4 of 44 seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers
   11 officers * $12 per cord = $132

Now, let's add the costs together: $884 + $10 + $132 = $1026

The total cost of the senior gifts is $1026."
"To find the cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.

Original cost = $400
Discount = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

Total cost for DIY = Original cost - Discount
Total cost for DIY = $400 - $80
Total cost for DIY = $320

The total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

The total number of shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to add the hours for each day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces of equipment and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces of equipment is x.

Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is the total number of functioning pieces multiplied by the cost per piece. Since the total cost is $400,000 and the total number of pieces is x, the cost per piece is $400,000/x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is 0.6x * (400,000/x) = 0.6 * 400,000 = $240,000.

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from each half of the sheep.

She has 30 sheep, so half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

"To find the number of rolls Mrs. Sherman had left after feeding her children, we need to subtract the number of rolls she gave to her children from the total number of rolls.

A dozen is equal to 12. So, Mrs. Sherman started with 12 rolls.

She fed her 6 children, leaving her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls.

Then, she broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces each roll was broken into:

6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Half of the class likes blue, so the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.
2. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.
3. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.
4. The rest of the pupils like yellow, which is 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

"To find the total number of apples picked, we need to first find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday and Wednesday.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add up the total number of apples picked over the three days: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the number of pairs and the number of loose socks.

She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Now, let's find the number of socks Lindsay has missed. There are 50 socks in total, and she has washed 35 socks. 

The number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months.

First, we need to calculate the total interest. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% or 0.10, and the time is 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Karan needs to pay.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we need to divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,105

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $1,105."
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time.

Cho's distance = speed * time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Cho's distance = 112 km

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we also multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = speed * time
Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Chloe's distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 
Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total amount of silver and gold they have:
Axel's silver: 50
Anna's silver: 100
Total silver: 50 + 100 = 150
Axel's gold: 80
Anna's gold: 120
Total gold: 80 + 120 = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350."
"To find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make, we multiply the number of pitchers by the number of cups per pitcher: 
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

To find the total number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Now, we subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the total profit: 
$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18 (profit)

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: 
$18 (profit) / 9 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is $2."
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we need to calculate 50% of 52, which is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 

Since half the people performing can't make it, we need to find half of the remaining number of girls. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13. 

The choir's 3 teachers will also be performing. So, the total number of people singing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 29."

Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the parts in the ratio (5 + 6 = 11).

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x.

We know that 5x + 6x = 165
Combine like terms: 11x = 165
Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now we know that Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles
And Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles

To find the difference, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to calculate the cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month.

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but since Tim is bundling them, he gets a 20% discount. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. 

To find the amount of money Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: 
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

So, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package and getting streaming services."
"To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, we can add up the time spent on each activity:
- Writing: 4 hours = 240 minutes
- Recording: 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes
- Editing: 90 minutes
Total time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100:
(90 / 450) * 100 = 20%

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Jenny gives 1/3 to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. To find the total number of slices given away, we need to add the fractions 1/3 and 1/4.

We already found the LCD of 3 and 4, which is 12. 

Now, we convert both fractions to have the same denominator:
1/3 = 4/12
1/4 = 3/12

Now, we add the fractions:
4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12

Since Jenny has 7/12 of the pizza initially, we can convert this to a decimal or find the whole number equivalent. 

To find the whole number equivalent, we can divide 7 by 12:
7 ÷ 12 = 0.5833

Since Jenny eats 2 slices, we subtract 2 from the whole number equivalent:
0.5833 - 2 = -1.4167

"To find out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to subtract the cost of the bike from the amount of money he has and then divide the result by his daily earnings.

Mark has $50 initially.
The bike costs $300.

$50 - $300 = -$250 (Mark doesn't have enough money, so he needs more)

Since Mark can't earn a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation. Let's assume Mark wants to save enough money to buy the bike, so we'll set up an equation:

$50 + (number of days * $10) = $300

Subtract $50 from both sides:
(number of days * $10) = $250

Divide both sides by $10:
number of days = $250 / $10
number of days = 25

Mark needs 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike."
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Number of spiders = 90
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs.
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first find the ages of Alice and Beth.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is:
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Since he gets paid $50 every day, his total earnings in a year are:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year

For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the daily energy usage is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day.

In 30 days, the total energy usage would be 7200 Wh/day * 30 days = 216,000 Wh.

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we can convert the total energy usage to kilowatts:
216,000 Wh / 1000 = 216 kWh.

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily energy usage would be 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day.

In 30 days, the new total energy usage would be 2700 Wh/day * 30 days = 81,000 Wh.

The energy saved is the difference between the original and new energy usage:
216,000 Wh - 81,000 Wh = 135,000 Wh.

Converting this to kilowatts:
135,000 Wh / 1000 = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we need to add up the total number of stripes and divide by the total number of zebras.

- One zebra with 36 stripes: 36
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes of the first one: 17 / 2 = 8.5
Total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 8.5 = 78.5

Now, let's find the average number of stripes by dividing the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras:
78.5 / 3 = 26.17

The average number of stripes is 26.17."
"To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Cost of meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cost of cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Total cost: $35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To find the number of corns, we know that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he must have 40 - 40 = 0 corns initially. Then, he bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis. 

Now, we know that there are twice as many corns as cannolis. So, the number of corns is 2 * 100 = 200.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, the total steps completed before the jog is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we subtract the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of words in the book by his reading rate.

Total words in the book = 45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words
Time to finish the book = Total words in the book / Reading rate = 9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for 40 hours. 
Total amount paid in May = 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the company had 3/4 of the original 40 employees, which is 30 employees. 
Total amount paid in June = 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

Total amount paid in the two months = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds, and the first pound is full price ($3), the second pound is half off ($3 * 0.5 = $1.50). So the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1. So the total cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the seashells and magnets to find the total cost: $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks first. 

The first package costs $400. The second package is worth twice that much, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). 
$1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150. 
$960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days.

Since she eats 2 cookies per night, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 cookies for 30 days.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we multiply 50000 by 0.05:
50000 * 0.05 = 2500 candles

Next, we need to find the probability that a candle will explode. Since 1% of the candles are defective and will explode, we multiply 50000 by 0.01:
50000 * 0.01 = 500 candles

Now, we need to find the intersection of the two events. Since these events are independent, we can multiply the number of candles that smell like wet dog by the probability that they will explode:
2500 * 0.01 = 25 candles

Therefore, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the discount amount for each blouse. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
Discount = 30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the discounted price.
Discounted price = Regular price - Discount
= $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to get the total cost.
Total cost = Discounted price * 4
= $14 * 4
= $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact amount is unknown.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'. 

- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

30 (Joanne's tallest) + 15 (Joanne's shortest) + x (Joanne's average) + 60 (sister's tallest) + 45 (sister's shortest) = 500

Combine like terms:

105 + x = 500

Subtract 105 from both sides:

x = 395

So, Joanne gathered 395 apples from the average trees."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can set up the following equation:

2C + D = 304 (total number of bumps)

We also know that the total number of heads is 180. Since each camel has one head and each dromedary has one head, we can set up another equation:

C + D = 180

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for C and D by solving the system of equations.

First, let's solve the second equation for C:

C = 180 - D

Now, substitute this expression for C into the first equation:

2(180 - D) + D = 304

Expand and simplify:

360 - 2D + D = 304

Combine like terms:

360 - D = 304

Subtract 360 from both sides:

-D = -56

Multiply both sides by -1:

D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 km.

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 km.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance covered in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each part of the trip:
800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 km.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

2. The initial number of cats was 50. After 20 cats were taken away, the remaining number of cats is 50 - 20 = 30.

3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

4. Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 cats left on the rock.

"To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we first need to find the total savings from the jogger jeans. 

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, and he saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * x = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3:

x = 6 * 3
x = 18

This means the total savings from the jogger jeans is $18. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans is:

$28 - $6 = $22

Now, we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $22. To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we add the total savings to the price of the jogger jeans:

$22 + $18 = $40

Now, we can find the difference in the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans:

$40 - $28 = $12

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds. The total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's say Kenny starts with x cards.

He sells the cards for $1.5 each, so he earns 1.5x dollars from selling the cards.

He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he keeps x/3 cards.

He has 1/3 of the cards, which is worth 1/3 * 1.5x = 0.5x dollars.

He also has $50 in spending cash.

Since the total amount he has is $100 (the cost of the ticket), we can set up the equation:

1.5x - 0.5x + 50 = 100

Combine like terms:

1x + 50 = 100

Subtract 50 from both sides:

1x = 50

Divide both sides by 1:

x = 50

So, Kenny starts with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many guests were initially prepared for two hotdogs. Since half of the guests were prepared for two hotdogs, we calculate this as 36 / 2 = 18 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer initially prepared enough hotdogs for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) would have only one hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we need to first find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of 6 letters is 6 / 2 = 3.

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we add 4 to 3. 
3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 
6 + 7 = 13.

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00
   - Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the 20% discount:
   20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

3. Calculate the final cost after the discount:
   Final cost = Total cost - Discount
   Final cost = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much money Dora needs, we need to add the cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the money she already has.

Cost of items: $6 (rope) + $11 (game) + $2 (ball) = $19

Dora has $2 (from her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

Now, let's subtract the money Dora has from the total cost of the items: $19 - $18 = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information step by step.

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. 
   Three quarters of 100 is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. 
   Twice 75 is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. 
   One-fifth of 150 is 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is 30."
"To find out how many gallons in a container, we need to divide the total gallons by the number of containers. 

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert gallons to pints. 

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which is 1/4 * 3 gallons = 3/4 gallon. 

Now, we convert 3/4 gallon to pints: 
3/4 * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George spent on chips. Since he spent $5 and had 1% left, he must have spent 99% of his money, which is 0.99 * $5 = $4.95.

Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents, we can find out how many bags he bought by dividing the amount he spent on chips by the cost of each bag: $4.95 / 0.40 = 12.375. Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to 12 bags.

"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. 
Remaining lollipops = Total lollipops - Lollipops kept by Ray
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5
Remaining lollipops = 20

Now, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.
Number of friends = 4
Lollipops per friend = Remaining lollipops / Number of friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4
Lollipops per friend = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake.

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of people who have a piece = 2

Weight of the pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece
Total weight of the pieces = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Weight of the remaining cake = Weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56

Now, divide the total oranges by the total number of people: 
56 ÷ 8 = 7

Everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To find the total cost of the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of the onions and the beef stock.

The cost of the onions: 
2 pounds of onions * $2.00 per pound = $4.00

The cost of the beef stock: 
2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00

The total cost of the ingredients: 
$4.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $8.00

Since Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. 
The cost of the onions: 
4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00

The total cost of the ingredients: 
$8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is: 
$12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving

The final answer is: $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we can calculate the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater as follows:

Time taken by Bernadette = 4 * Time taken by Wayne
Time taken by Bernadette = 4 * 4 minutes
Time taken by Bernadette = 16 minutes

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne. 

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to subtract 5 minutes from the time it takes her to drive to the theater:

Time difference = Time taken by Bernadette - Time taken by Wayne
Time difference = 16 minutes - 4 minutes
Time difference = 12 minutes

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 by 3.

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet."
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of beads each sister has. To do this, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature change due to the oven and the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to the oven:
The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus spends 3 hours baking, the total temperature increase is:
5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature change due to the window:
The window cools down the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it's open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the total temperature decrease is:
2 degrees/10 minutes * 3 intervals (30 minutes / 10 minutes) = 6 degrees

Now, we need to subtract the temperature decrease due to the window from the temperature increase due to the oven:
Initial temperature: 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to oven: 15 degrees
Temperature decrease due to window: 6 degrees
Final temperature: 40 - 15 + 6 = 31 degrees

Final answer: 31"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = swim time + bike time + run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 1 hour 20 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time.
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike. 
James' bike time = 1 hour 20 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

Now, we know James' swim and bike times. We also know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting James' swim and bike times from James' total time.
James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is 59."
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie C in minutes. 

Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total distance the horse runs, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

Time in hours = 30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Distance = Speed * Time = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:

Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is 8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30. 

Change = $30 - $24 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of eggs Rozanne has, we need to add the eggs from the cases and the loose eggs. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs is 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find the number of glasses. 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find the number of trays. 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning, we need to subtract the points Marcy scored from the points Joey scored.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
17 sneakers * $20 = $340

Next, let's find the number of sneakers left:
48 sneakers - 17 sneakers = 31 sneakers

Now, let's find the total revenue from selling the remaining 31 sneakers at $25 each:
31 sneakers * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

The total cost was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $1115 - $576
= $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and add them together.

Six packets had 8 colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 * 8 = 48.

Four packets had 16 colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 * 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of popcorn as P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of buying a super ticket.

The cost of a super ticket is $20, and the cost of a movie ticket is $12. The cost of a soda is $3. 

The cost of buying a super ticket is $20. 
The cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can set up the equation:

$15 + P = $20

Subtracting $15 from both sides of the equation gives us:

P = $5

So, the regular price of popcorn is $5."
"To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the original cost per balloon. 

The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. 

Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Cost per balloon = $900 / 20
Cost per balloon = $45

Now, the cost per balloon increased by $20. 

New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + Increase
New cost per balloon = $45 + $20
New cost per balloon = $65

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase.

Total cost = Number of balloons * New cost per balloon
Total cost = 170 * $65
Total cost = $11,050

The final answer is: $11,050"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Distance = Speed * Time
For the first part of the trip: Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second part of the trip: Distance2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Initially, Jenna had 8 sapphires worth $800. She traded 3 sapphires, so she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the remaining sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna received 2 rubies, which are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To find the total volume of the raised beds, we need to multiply the width, length, and height of each bed.

Volume of one bed = width * length * height
Volume of one bed = 2 * 8 * 2
Volume of one bed = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:
Total volume = 10 * 32
Total volume = 320 cubic feet

Since each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total volume / 2
Number of bags = 320 / 2
Number of bags = 160

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

The total cost of the potting soil will be $1920."
"To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9

Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know the number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green cards.
Number of yellow cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39

Now, let's add up the number of cards of all colors.
Total number of cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 

Twenty minutes later, half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. 
Half of 50 is 25, so 25 fairies joined from the east. 
Now, the total number of fairies is 50 (initial) + 25 (new ones) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. 
So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12). 

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35%"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each item and add them together.

Earnings from plastic bottles per week: 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents
Total earnings per week: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Now, let's multiply her weekly earnings by 4 to find out her monthly earnings:
21 cents * 4 = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents per month from recycling."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. 

Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants by multiplying Frederick's plants by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6). 

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants * 1.6
Toni's plants = 10 * 1.6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's plants.

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x.

Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2:

2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. To do this, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100:

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: 3 * $8 = $24

Now, we add the cost of both pizzas to find the total cost.

Total cost = $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost of 2 packs of razors, first, calculate the total cost without the coupon. 

2 packs of razors cost 2 * $4.00 = $8.00

Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. 

1 pack of razors costs $4.00

Now, apply the $2.00 coupon. 

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, convert the cost to cents. 

$2.00 = 200 cents

The final cost per individual razor is 200 cents."
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer consists of 4 girls, each 64"" tall. 
4 * 64 = 256 inches

The next layer consists of 3 girls, each standing on top of the 4 below them. 
Since the 10th girl is 60"" tall, the average height of this layer is (60 + 64 + 64 + 64) / 3 = 64 inches

The total height of the bottom 2 layers is 256 + 64 = 320 inches

The next layer consists of 2 girls, each standing on top of the 3 below them. 
Since the average height of this layer is (60 + 64) / 2 = 62 inches

The total height of the bottom 3 layers is 320 + 62 = 382 inches

The top layer consists of the shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall.

The total height of the human pyramid is 382 + 60 = 442 inches

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches).
442 / 12 = 36.83 feet

The final answer is: 36.83"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walks, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walks per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours a day. So, she walks for 5 minutes * 8 hours = 40 minutes per day.

Since she works for 5 days, the total number of minutes she walks is 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

"To find Angela's current age, we need to first find her age in four years. 

Since Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, we can set up the equation: 
3 * 14 = Angela's age in 4 years

Angela's age in 4 years = 3 * 14
Angela's age in 4 years = 42

Now, to find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 from her age in 4 years:
Angela's current age = 42 - 4
Angela's current age = 38

The final answer is 38."
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Morning rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of morning rides: 28 rides * $6 per ride = $168

Afternoon rides: 2 rides per day * 14 days = 28 rides
Cost of afternoon rides: 28 rides * $2 per ride = $56

Total cost: $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224

"To find the total number of oranges, we need to calculate the number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost for each guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $25x (cost per guest).

We want to find when the two costs are equal, so we set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as B. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found B/2 insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found B/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

B + B/2 + 7 = 43

To solve for B, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + B + 14 = 86

Combine like terms:

3B + 14 = 86

Subtract 14 from both sides:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

David found B/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found B/2 + 7 = 24/2 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 insects.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to first find out the total cost of the non-strawberry gum. 

She bought 2 packs of grape gum for $2 each, so the total cost of grape gum is 2 * $2 = $4. 

She also bought a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of a grape gum pack, which is $2 / 2 = $1. 

The total cost of non-strawberry gum is $4 + $1 = $5. 

Since she paid $7 in total, the total cost of strawberry gum is $7 - $5 = $2. 

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

For 2 x 4 lumber:
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 lumber:
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 lumber to save money.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of 2 x 8 lumber he can buy with $24:
Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 lumber gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:
Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the cost of each pair of snowshoes.

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips per week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep in each location and then add them together.

The farm has 30 cows and half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows.

Now, we add the number of cows and sheep in each location: 
Farm: 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

The total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 45 + 80 = 125.

"To find the number of days Andy has to lose weight, we need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories over 211 days. 

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days: 
3500 calories / 211 days ≈ 16.6 calories per day

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 16.6 calories per day to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate how much he earned in a week and subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald earns $30 per day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns:
30 * 7 = $210

He spent $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from the amount earned:
210 - 100 = $110

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs, we need to multiply the amount of water she needs per kilometer by the number of kilometers she will run.

She needs 60 ml of water per kilometer.
She will run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km.
So, the total distance she will run is 8 * 0.25 = 2 km.

Now, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer: 
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Hannah will need 120 ml of water."
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

"To find the cost of the house, we need to divide the total cost by 4, since the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3x

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first find out how many cookies Josh made. 

Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To find the total amount of money Ali has, we need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills.

Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20)
Total money = $40 + $120
Total money = $160

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister, so he is left with:
Remaining money = Total money / 2
Remaining money = $160 / 2
Remaining money = $80

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. To find the amount he spends on dinner, we multiply the remaining money by 3/5:
Amount spent on dinner = (3/5) * $80
Amount spent on dinner = (3/5) * $80
Amount spent on dinner = $48

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
Remaining money after dinner = Remaining money - Amount spent on dinner
Remaining money after dinner = $80 - $48

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. 

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it means one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (2 times 5 days). 

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people can paint a whole house in the same amount of time it takes one person to paint a whole house, we can divide the total hours by 5:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chairs Ophelia has, then find the number of chairs Jenna has, and finally add the number of sofas for both.

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs she has:

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas is 'x - 2'. We know that the number of sofas is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 22

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has by multiplying the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3:

Number of chairs Jenna has = 3 * 22 = 66

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have by adding the number of sofas and chairs for both:

Total number of sofas and chairs = 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. However, it is stated that 3 times fewer passengers get on, so we need to subtract 3 times the number who got off from the number who got on. So, 63 - 3 * 21 = 63 - 63 = 0. 

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 59."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be 27, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22.

In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. 
So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will be 2 * 22 + 5 = 49.

Since Jame's cousin's age in 8 years is 49, Jame's current age is 49 - 8 = 41.

Now, we know Jame's current age is 22 and his cousin's current age is 41. 

The difference between their ages is 41 - 22 = 19.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we need to first find the cost of the printer. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:
Cost of printer = Cost of computer - $400
Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the two monitors:
Cost of two monitors = Total cost - Cost of printer
Cost of two monitors = $2,400 - $700
Cost of two monitors = $1,700

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of two monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of two monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $1,700 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $850

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
So, the number of seashells brought by the girls is 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300.

Now, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. 
There are 10 girls, so the number of seashells brought by each girl is 300 / 10 = 30.

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make.

Total vlogs made so far: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54
Total vlogs needed: 72

Number of vlogs left to make: 72 - 54 = 18

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month."
"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the tip to the original bill: 
$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the eldest boy received $18 and shared it among 3 boys. So, each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he added another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

He spent $8 from his total, so he had $21 - $8 = $13 left.

He then tripled the amount he had left, which is $13 * 3 = $39.

The final answer is $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know Elvis has a monthly target of $1125. Since there are 30 days in April, we can divide the target by 30 to find the daily savings needed for the first half of the month.

$1125 ÷ 15 (half of 30) = $75 per day for the first half of the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we multiply the daily savings for the first half by 2.

$75 × 2 = $150 per day for the second half of the month.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total cost of the fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00
The cost of 6 peaches is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50

The total cost of the fruit is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00."
"To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * 0.8 = $16.

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * 0.5 = $10.

The difference between their earnings is $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, we multiply x by 4:

Jeff's amount = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To find the total miles Jeff walks, we need to calculate the distance he walks each day and multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back, the distance he walks each day is 2 times the distance from his home to work. 

Distance from home to work = 3 miles
Distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:
6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

The final answer is 30."
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break it down step by step:

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice, so 2 * 26 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. 
In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families. 
In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families. 
In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families.

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

"To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first find the number of toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 toys.

The cost of 2 pens is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator is $12
The cost of 1 geometry set is $10

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $20, which is 0.10 * $20 = $2
The total cost after the discount is $20 - $2 = $18

Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the remaining $1500.

For the first $1000, the commission is 30% of $1000, which is:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the remaining $1500, the commission is 10% of $1500, which is:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together to get the total amount earned:
$300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To find out how many bottles Bill needs, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. 

He has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Since he wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, he will need 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Bill will need 92 additional bottles of water to have enough for his guests."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a hot day and a cold day.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3 * 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2 * 16 = 32 minutes
2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3 to find the time it takes to swim 3 miles:
3 * 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time between a hot day and a cold day, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to first find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size: 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size: 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Peter's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size: 12 * 1/4 = 12 * 0.25 = 3 cubic inches

"To find out how many cups Juan drinks, we need to know how many cups Octavia drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, we can start by finding out how many cups Octavia drinks.

Let's say Octavia drinks x cups of coffee. Since she drinks half the daily recommended cups, we can set up the equation:

x = 0.5 * daily recommended cups

However, we don't know the daily recommended cups. Let's call it y. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

x = 0.5y

We know that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so we can set up another equation:

Juan's coffee intake = 10 * Octavia's coffee intake
Juan's coffee intake = 10 * 0.5y
Juan's coffee intake = 5y

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. So, we can set up another equation:

Juan's current coffee intake - reduced coffee intake = 4
5y - 4 = 4

Now, we can solve for y:

5y = 8
y = 8 / 5
y = 1.6

Now that we know the daily recommended cups, we can find out how many cups Octavia drinks:

x = 0.5y
x = 0.5 * 1.6
x = 0.8

Now that we know how many cups Octavia drinks, we can find out how many cups Juan drinks:

Juan's coffee intake = 10 * Octavia's coffee intake
Juan's coffee intake = 10 * 0.8
Juan's coffee intake = 8

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we can subtract the reduced coffee intake from his current coffee intake:

Reduced coffee intake = Juan's current coffee intake - reduced coffee intake
Reduced coffee intake = 8 - 4
Reduced coffee intake = 4

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in angle of the sun relative to the ground.

The initial angle of the sun is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour. 

Since the sun moves for 10 hours, the change in angle will be:
5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we need to add this change to the initial angle to find the final angle:
32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

The final angle of the sun relative to the ground is 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many candles James needs, we first need to determine the age of his younger son. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many candles James needs in total. Since the older son is 12 and the younger son is 8, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to divide the total number of candles by 5 to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 20 / 5 = 4.

So, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles. The total cost will be 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week. Since she read 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, she read a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5. 

105 / 1.5 = 70

So, in the first week, Judy read 70 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week.

70 + 100 = 170

1/4 of 12 is 3.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches.
12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. We can write this as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we need to follow the given information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as 'x'. Then, the number of goals scored by Anna would be 'x - 45'. 

Since Richie scored 80 goals, we can set up the equation: 
x + 20 = 80

Solving for x, we get:
x = 60

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals, we can find Anna's score:
Anna's score = x - 45
= 60 - 45
= 15

Now, we have the scores of all three teenagers:
Richie: 80
Mark: 60
Anna: 15

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their scores:
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 15

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and plastic action figures separately.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day, so he spent a total of:
5 * 4 = $20

He had $70 initially, so he has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he spent $2 each day, so he spent a total of:
2 * 3 = $6

He had $50 left, so he has $50 - $6 = $44 left.

Since he bought plastic action figures at $2 each, the total number of plastic action figures he bought is:
$44 / $2 = 22

Adding the wooden action figures he bought from Sunday to Wednesday (5 * 4 = 20) to the plastic action figures he bought (22), we get:
20 + 22 = 42

So, Peter will have 42 action figures by the end of the week.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we need to calculate the total number of roses he supplies to the shops per week and then multiply it by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month).

First, let's calculate the total number of roses supplied per week:
20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total number of roses supplied per week by 4:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, let's calculate how many roses Ford grows per month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses he supplies per month:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account in 2 years.

Since she removes $100 every month, the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) is:

$76,000 (Herb's house) + $53,200 (Juan's house) = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils, we need to first find the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen (12) cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, the discounted price of one box is:
$100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = $100.00 * 0.90 = $90.00

The total cost of 2 boxes is:
$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Since there are 90 single-use contacts in 1 box, 2 boxes will have:
90 * 2 = 180 contacts

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
$180.00 / 180 = $1.00 per pair of contacts.

Final answer: $1.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many calories Hannah burns in total, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running separately.

Calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink water.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Now, we multiply the number of times she needs to drink water by the amount of water she needs per time.

8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's start by using variables to represent the number of each color of jelly beans. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B, the number of red jelly beans is R, and the number of green jelly beans is G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write an equation:

G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to add the three numbers together and divide by 3.

Initial speed: 47 WPM
Increased speed: 52 WPM
New speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

Now, let's add the three speeds together: 
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3:
156 / 3 = 52

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

For Cheerios: 
Weight lost per week = 1.25 pounds
Total weight lost in 5 weeks = 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds

For Donuts:
Weight gained per week = 1.75 pounds
Total weight gained in 5 weeks = 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options = Total weight gained - Total weight lost
= 8.75 - 6.25
= 2.5 pounds

The final answer is: 2.5"
"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, the number of friends' friends, and the number of spouses.

1. Alex invited 100 people.
2. Each invited person said they will invite 2 friends, so the number of friends invited is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex called 10 friends to invite them, and 8 of them said they will bring their spouses. This means 8 more people will be attending.
4. Now, we add up all the people: 
   - Alex (1) + invited people (100) + friends of invited people (200) + friends of Alex (10) + spouses of friends (8) = 1 + 100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 319

So, Alex will need 319 seats for the event."
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to follow the order of the weights given in the problem.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

On Amazon, the total cost is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the beanstalk on each day until it exceeds Mark's window height.

Day 1: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall, which is less than Mark's window height of 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes 4 x 2 = 8 feet tall.

Day 3: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 8 x 2 = 16 feet tall.

Day 4: The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes 16 x 2 = 32 feet tall.

Since 32 feet is greater than Mark's window height of 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the 4th day.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find the grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can calculate the grams of protein per day as follows:

200 grams of mushrooms / 100 grams per cup = 2 cups of mushrooms per day
Since each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we multiply the number of cups by the grams of protein per cup:
2 cups * 3 grams per cup = 6 grams of protein per day

Now, to find the grams of protein per week, we multiply the grams of protein per day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
6 grams per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams per week

The final answer is 42."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much George needs to pay for the dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and the crown.

The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15) to find out how many hours he needs to work:

$3900 / $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x. 
Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, the third angle is 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:
- The second angle is 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
- The third angle is 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

Colby has 8 quarters, which is 8 * $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 * $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many Colby can buy: $3.45 / $0.05 = 69.

The final answer is 69."
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

Now, we add this to the original weight: 
8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 
12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

The final weight Jamaal uses is 10 pounds."
"To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 1 * 12 = 12 games
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so 12 + 5 = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 1 * 12 = 12 games
- He buys 2 games per month for the remaining 12 months, so 2 * 12 = 24 games
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so 12 + 24 + 5 = 41 games

Year 3: 
- He buys 1 game per month for 3 months, so 1 * 3 = 3 games
- He buys 2 games per month for 9 months, so 2 * 9 = 18 games
- He buys 4 games per month for the remaining 9 months, so 4 * 9 = 36 games
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so 3 + 18 + 36 + 5 = 62 games

The total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 62."
"To find the rate of the plane, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken.

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use the rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take the plane 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the amount of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the amount Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa makes 3/4 of 60 pounds, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. 
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 * $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from his original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each period and add them together.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup.
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

"To find the total number of rotations per year, we need to first find the total number of rotations per month and then multiply it by 12.

Total rotations per month = 400 miles / 2 miles per rotation = 200 rotations
Total rotations per year = 200 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 2400 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:

Number of years = Total rotations / Total rotations per year
= 10,440,000 / 2400

"To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings per pump. 

Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per washing = Total cost / Total number of washings
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120
Cost per washing = $0.20

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost of 1 pump will be:
Cost per pump = Cost per washing * Number of washings per pump
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 60
Cost per pump = $12.00

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
Cost per pump = $12.00 * 100
Cost per pump = 1200 cents

The final answer is 1200."
"To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount first. 

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 
Discount = 30% of $25 = 0.3 * $25 = $7.50
Price of the shirt after discount = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shorts is $35. 
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the sales tax first. 
Sales tax rate is not given, but we can assume it's 8% for this example. 
Sales tax = 8% of $52.50 = 0.08 * $52.50 = $4.20

Total cost of the outfit with sales tax = $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Joe has $50 initially. 
Money left after the purchase = $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe can't have a negative amount of money, he will be short $6.70."
"To find the total amount of butter needed, we need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days. 
4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we multiply 28 dozen by 1/4 pound:
28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 * 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 * 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

The total cost of John's research is $2,077,625."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add the ounces of meat each player ate:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat. 

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

Since each member posts 3 posts per day, we multiply the number of members by the number of posts per day and then by the number of days in March.

Total posts = 1000 members * 3 posts/member * 31 days
Total posts = 1000 * 3 * 31
Total posts = 93,000

The total number of posts in the group in March will be 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per week, then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so he uses 2 * 20 gallons = 40 gallons per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total gallons of water used per year is 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons/year.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of water used per year. A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost is 2080 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $312/year.

"To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row: 
4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so the number of seats occupied by administrators is:
72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are:
72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so the number of seats occupied by parents is:
54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

The number of seats occupied by students is:
54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he chews throughout the day.

1. At school: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. On the way home from school: Jim chews 1 piece of gum.

3. After dinner: Jim chews 1 piece of gum.

4. Total gum chewed: 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

5. Initially, Jim had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

6. Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

7. Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find Charmaine's current age, we need to subtract 12 from 16. 

16 - 12 = 4

Now, we need to add 4 to her current age to find her age 4 years from now.

4 + 4 = 8

Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is:
9 * 3 = 27

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is:
8 * 14 = 112

Now, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:
112 - 27 = 85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to calculate 4/5 of the total number of flowers.

Total number of flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Number of bloomed flowers = 4/5 * 200 = 160 flowers

The number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is 160.

160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second.

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can divide her speed by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second.

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Now, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute and 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in 1 hour.

Multiply her speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get her speed in Mb per hour.

0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. 
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on both periods:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his annual growth rate.

Current height: 40 inches
Required height: 4 feet = 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Now, let's calculate the difference:
48 - 40 = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we'll divide the difference by his growth rate:
8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"To find James' earnings, we need to calculate the profit first. 

The cost of the cars is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000. The company paid 30% of that, which is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000. 

The profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000. 

James got a 10% commission on the profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, we multiply 100 by 0.25 to find the number of riders who can stay upright: 
100 * 0.25 = 25

Since 60% of these riders are women, we multiply 25 by 0.6 to find the number of women who can stay upright:
25 * 0.6 = 15

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:
25 - 15 = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of gold and silver jewels.

Since the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so we can calculate the price of a silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to find the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

45"
"To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. 

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first. 

Since Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17. 

17 - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught.

11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the total cost of the classes and then subtract the maximum cost they are willing to pay.

The total cost of the classes is $60. 

Since they won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can calculate the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for as follows:

$60 / $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, he can miss up to 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel.

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both Julie and Jewel is 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, we can set up an equation: Reggie's distance + 3 = Lynn's distance.

Now, we can substitute Reggie's distance (20 miles) into the equation: 20 + 3 = Lynn's distance.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 23 = Lynn's distance.

The final answer is 23."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50

Now, let's add the costs together: $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the hole.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3 to find the total time it will take to dig the hole.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is $7,500.

The cost of leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The cost of running boards is $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The cost of the upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new monthly salary, we need to first calculate the raise amount and the bonus amount.

The raise amount is 5% of his current salary: 
$20000 * 0.05 = $1000

His new monthly salary is his current salary plus the raise amount: 
$20000 + $1000 = $21000

The bonus is half a month's salary: 
$20000 / 2 = $10000

Now, we add the bonus to his new monthly salary: 
$21000 + $10000 = $31000

To find his yearly salary, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12: 
$31000 * 12 = $372000

The final answer is: $372000"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The total cost of everything is $9000."
"To find the total number of articles published, we need to calculate the number of articles published by each website in February and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day. Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

The final answer is 29."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags.

"To find the total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance covered by each of them separately and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance covered by Alisa is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 * 4.5
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance covered by Stanley is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 * 2.5
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances covered by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance covered by Alisa + Distance covered by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 + 25
Total Distance = 79 miles

The total distance covered by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

Time to dig through soil: 
Distance of soil = 24 feet
Rate of digging through soil = 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = Distance / Rate = 24 / 4 = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay:
Distance of clay = 8 feet
Rate of digging through clay = 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour (since he digs half as fast through clay)
Time to dig through clay = Distance / Rate = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got $2 off, so the total cost was:
20 * $20 - $2 = $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we need to find the total cost before the discount:
20 * $30 = $600

Then, we apply the 10% discount:
$600 * 0.10 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
$398 - $540 = -$142

However, since the question asks for the difference, and the result is negative, it means that Clara paid less than Sheila. The correct answer is $142."
"To find the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we need to calculate the sales for each month.

In the first month, let's say the sales from green hats were x. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount from green hats, the sales from red hats were x/2.

We know that the total sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400
x = 800

So, the sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

In the second month, the sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. The total sales of the first month were $800 + $400 = $1200. 

The sales in the second month were 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is $800 + $900 = $1700.

The final answer is: $1700"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. 

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg for 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total deviled egg halves: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs).

"To solve this problem, we need to find the cooking time for beans and pork.

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We also know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of this time is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three items: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. 

Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, the total number of heads is the sum of the number of sheep and geese: s + g = 20.

Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70, so we can set up another equation: 4s + 2g = 70.

We can solve these equations simultaneously. 

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of 'g' in both equations the same: 2s + 2g = 40.

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'g': (4s + 2g) - (2s + 2g) = 70 - 40, which simplifies to 2s = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he needs a week's worth, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2. The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money each person has.

Aurelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's add up the money of all three: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To find out how much each person would have if they share equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120.

For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Total amount of dry ingredients needed: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons

The final answer is: 132"
"To find the total amount of candy, we need to add the amount of candy each person had initially. 

Robert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. 
Total amount of candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they want to share the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total amount by 3 (the number of people).

12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds

So, each person will have 4 pounds of candy."
"To find the total cost of the candies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of candy and add them together.

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 * $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

$15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is $4."
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of days that were good, bad, and neutral.

We know that Christina had 12 good days initially, 8 good days in the next 3 days, and 8 good days in the first 8 days. So, the total number of good days is 12 + 8 + 8 = 28.

However, we also know that the total number of days in the month is 30. Since 12 + 8 + 8 = 28, the remaining 2 days must be neutral.

Now, we need to subtract the 2 neutral days from the total number of good days. 28 - 2 = 26.

Therefore, there are 26 good days left in the month.

26"
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sally has x books. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can write the equation as:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 20 feet to inches by multiplying 20 by 12.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we can divide 600 by 30.

600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

So, it will take 20 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog needs 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs is 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs.
3. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 12 toys initially.
4. When James came back, there were twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is now 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
5. However, 3 dogs were gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
6. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 21 toys.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5.

Dylan's investment = 1200 * (2/5) = 480

2. Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount.

Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

3. Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply the remaining amount by 2/3.

Frances' investment = 720 * (2/3) = 480

4. Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment.

Skyler's investment = 720 - 480 = 240

So, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we need to first find out how many signatures they have already collected. 

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach 100 signatures in total, we need to subtract the signatures they already have from their goal. 
100 - 64 = 36 signatures

The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"To find out how much Karen earns, we need to first find out how much Lorie earns in two days. 

Lorie earns $10 per hour and works for 2 days, so she earns 10 * 2 = $20 in 2 days.

Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, Karen earns 2 * 20 = $40 in 2 days.

Karen works 3 hours per day, so in 2 days, she works 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

To find out how much Karen earns in 6 hours, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: 40 * 6 = $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the number of hash browns, we need to divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes required to make 36 hash browns.

Number of potatoes per batch = 6
Number of hash browns per batch = 36

To find the number of batches, we divide the total number of potatoes by the number of potatoes per batch:
96 ÷ 6 = 16

Since each batch makes 36 hash browns, we multiply the number of batches by the number of hash browns per batch:
16 * 36 = 576

Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

576"
"To find the total weight of the 9 people, we need to multiply the weight of one adult by the number of adults.

Weight of one adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg

Since the maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, the excess weight is:

Excess weight = Total weight of 9 adults - Maximum load of the elevator
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max has, then find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, and finally add up the number of cookies each of them has.

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies: 
68 + 5 = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies:
73 - 12 = 61

Now that we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Summer has by adding 23 to Max's cookies:
73 + 23 = 96

Now that we know the number of cookies each of them has, we can add them up to find the total number of cookies:
68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the changes made to the dress.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress.

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 1 hour = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we need to add the time taken for both modes to get the total time.

Total time = 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes

"To find the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes, which is twice the number of cookies Greta bakes. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are two sets: one set of twins and one set of triplets.
- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

The final answer is 21.67."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he has available before dinner.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To find the total number of coins Rong has saved, we need to multiply the number of coins he saves per month by the number of months in a year and then multiply by the number of years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. In 10 years, Rong will have saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per year. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month. 2/5 of 20 is 8, so Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year. In 10 years, Neil will have saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

Now, let's add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved after 10 years. 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

0.6x = 40
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.6:
x = 40 / 0.6
x = 66.67

Now we know the total bill is $66.67. To find out how much John leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
$125 - $66.67 = $58.33

The final answer is $58.33."
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:

- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. Since 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting 80% from 40%.

40% - 80% = -40%

However, this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because 80% is greater than 40%. 

To find the correct answer, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%.

First, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city. Since 80% of 40% is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by finding the percentage of 40% that is not used for industrial purposes.

Let's find the percentage of 40% that is not used for industrial purposes. 

Since 80% of 40% is used for industrial purposes, 20% of 40% is not used for industrial purposes. 

20% of 40% = 0.2 * 40% = 8%

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is 8%."

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and then subtract the cost of picking them.

Cost of picking blueberries: 
- Initial cost: $20
- Cost per pound: $1.5
- Total cost of blueberries: $20 + (30 pounds * $1.5/pound) = $20 + $45 = $65

Cost of buying blueberries at the store:
- Cost per pound: $2.5
- Total cost of blueberries: 30 pounds * $2.5/pound = $75

Now, let's calculate the amount James saved:
- Amount saved: $75 (store cost) - $65 (picking cost) = $10

James saved $10 by picking blueberries himself."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid, we need to first calculate the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for each scenario and add them together.

Scenario 1: Both arms down, 5 minutes
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute, so 300 * 5 = 1500 taps
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute, so 250 * 5 = 1250 taps
- Total taps in this scenario: 1500 + 1250 = 2750 taps

Scenario 2: Both arms up, 3 minutes
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute, so 200 * 3 = 600 taps
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute, so 200 * 3 = 600 taps
- Total taps in this scenario: 600 + 600 = 1200 taps

Total taps in 5 minutes: 2750 + 1200 = 3950 taps

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To find out how many slices were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people, they ate 3 * (2/3) = 2 pizzas. The total number of slices they ate is 2 * 12 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * (3/4) = 1.5 pizzas. The total number of slices they ate is 1.5 * 12 = 18 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42 slices. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

Time taken by the cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages.

Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

First, we convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then we add the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. We are told that this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of Bobby's shoe as 'x'. 

We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Now we solve for 'x': 
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long."
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for students' cars and teachers' cars separately.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to divide the total number of days he wants the gum to last (30 days) by the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4 pieces).

30 days / 4 pieces per day = 7.5

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days.

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To find the total number of smores needed, we need to calculate the number of smores for kids and adults separately.

Number of smores for kids: 9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
Number of smores for adults: 6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores

Total number of smores needed: 18 smores (kids) + 6 smores (adults) = 24 smores

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

"To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Dora's father's age: Since Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can calculate it as follows:
   Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
   Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
   Father's age = 30 + 8
   Father's age = 38

2. Find Dora's mother's age: Since Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, we can calculate it as follows:
   Mother's age = Father's age - 4
   Mother's age = 38 - 4
   Mother's age = 34

3. Calculate the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

"To find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we need to know the number of votes against it. Let's denote the number of votes against as 'x'. 

Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to first find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. 
60% of 40 people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Since 10 + 24 = 34 people think horse #2 and horse #7 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16 people.

"To find the total number of Pomeranians, we know that one third of them are girls, and there are 6 girls. 

Let's set up an equation: 
1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:
Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find out how much Jayden needs, we first need to calculate how much money Ava gave him. Since Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, we can calculate it as follows:

$90 / 2 = $45

Now, we add the money Jayden already has ($70) to the money Ava gave him ($45):

$70 + $45 = $115

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we need to first determine how many cases the first house needs. 

Since the first house needs 1/2 of the total, we can calculate it as follows:
Total cases = 250
Cases needed by the first house = 1/2 * 250 = 125

Now, we know the third house needs double the amount of the first house. 
Cases needed by the third house = 2 * 125 = 250

So, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.

Final answer: 250"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 x $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 x $1 = $5.
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (cucumbers) + $5 (tomatoes) + $3 (lettuce) = $14.

The total amount spent by the three of them is $14."
"To find the number of pears, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas and add it to 200.

45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, add 90 to 200 to find the number of pears: 200 + 90 = 290

Since George has 200 bananas and 290 pears, the total number of fruits George has is 200 + 290 = 490.

The final answer is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money she had initially.

Initial amount of money = $80
Cost of the ball = $20
Remaining money = Initial amount of money - Cost of the ball
Remaining money = $80 - $20
Remaining money = $60

Since each candy bar costs $5, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar to find out how many candy bars Marissa bought.

Number of candy bars = Remaining money / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5
Number of candy bars = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total cost, we need to first find out how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs to make 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters will require 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so 20 kilograms will cost 20 * 3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find the total number of books read, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can divide 300 by 2 to find out how many books Ahmed read: 300 / 2 = 150.

Now, we know that Ezra read 300 books initially and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

To find the total number of books read altogether, we add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed: 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Monday would be:
4 classes * 5 hours * $15 per hour = 4 * 5 * 15 = $60

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = 2 * 2 * 15 = $60

Since she earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes, and she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns an additional $5 on Monday. So, her total earnings for Monday would be:
$60 + $5 = $65

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is less than 3, so she doesn't earn the additional $5. Her total earnings for Wednesday remain $60.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days:
$65 (Monday) + $60 (Wednesday) = $125

Tanya earned $125 for these two days of teaching."
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 scents per type * 4 types = 20 scents
Fruity scents sold: 2 scents per type * 8 types = 16 scents

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 (vanilla) - 16 (fruity) = 4

The perfume company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he earns from selling eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he earns from eggplants is:
20 * 3 = 60

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We also know that he earns $60 from eggplants. To find out how much he needs to earn from corn, we subtract the amount he earns from eggplants from the total amount he wants to make:
135 - 60 = 75

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we can divide the amount he needs to earn from corn by the number of ears of corn to find the price per ear:
75 / 25 = 3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has for soccer, we need to subtract the time she spends reading and playing video games from her total weekend time.

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent on soccer = Total weekend time - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent on soccer = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes him to drive to the museum and back.

Time taken to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed
Time taken to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time taken to drive to the museum = 2 hours

Since Jack spends 6 hours at the museum, the total time he is gone from home is the sum of the time taken to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

Total time = Time taken to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 8 hours

"To find the total number of wheels needed, we need to calculate the number of wheels for the cars and the number of wheels for the motorcycles.

For the cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
For the motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total number of wheels needed: 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels available in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

The number of wheels left will be 276."
"To find the amount you have to pay after the discount, you need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

"To find the cost of replacing the movies, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in series.
Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:
Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining movies.
Since 200 movies are in series, the remaining movies are:
Remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Step 3: Calculate the number of older movies.
40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we can calculate it as follows:
Number of older movies = 40% of 400
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the movies in series.
Since the movies in series cost $6 each, the total cost is:
Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost per movie
= 200 * 6
= 1200

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.
Since the older movies cost $5 each, the total cost is:
Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per movie
= 160 * 5
= 800

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the normal movies.
Since the remaining movies are normal movies, we can calculate the number of normal movies as follows:
Number of normal movies = Remaining movies - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240
The cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost per movie
= 240 * 10
= 2400

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.
Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= 1200 + 800 + 2400
= 4400

The final answer is: 4400"

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to first find the speed at which they hiked. 

The family drove at 50 miles per hour. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 

5 miles per hour less than 25 miles per hour is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour. 

They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. 

Distance = speed * time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points earned by each player.

Let's assume Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score: 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score: 
- She collects 5 berries.
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score: 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 5 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 25 + 900 = 1825

The difference between their scores is 1825 - 820 = 1005.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars.

First, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars: 
64 - 30 = 34

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
34 / 2 = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so the total number of times is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the other two days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. For 2 days, that's 6 * 2 = 12 times.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 15 + 12 = 27.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 

Let's assume the number of white fish he bought is x.

After buying x white fish, the total number of white fish becomes 4 + x.

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish is 2(4 + x).

We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17. So, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x.

Since the number of orange fish is 2(4 + x), we can set up the equation:

2(4 + x) = 17 - x

Expanding the equation, we get:

8 + 2x = 17 - x

Now, let's solve for x:

8 + 2x = 17 - x
8 + 2x + x = 17
3x = 9
x = 3

So, Bob bought 3 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then divide it by his fuel efficiency.

Since Andy travels to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day.

The total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Now, we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week:

Fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumption = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Fuel consumption = 5 gallons

Since the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, the total cost of fuel consumption per week is:

Total cost = Fuel consumption * Price per gallon
Total cost = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Total cost = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent.

The value of the quarters is 140 quarters * $0.25 = $35.

The value of the twenties she spent is 3/5 * 10 twenties = 6 twenties.
Since 1 twenty is $20, the value of the twenties she spent is 6 * $20 = $120.

The total amount of money she paid for lunch is $35 (quarters) + $120 (twenties) = $155.

John is missing $150."
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we need to calculate the difference in temperature between the day and night, and then divide that by the temperature increase per log.

The temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of one log:

12 / 5 = 2.4

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. 

Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2

"To find out how much Billy earns, we need to calculate his hourly wage after each raise.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. 
After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.
On his first anniversary, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours:
$11.50 * 20 = $230

Since Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, her starting hourly wage is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00.
Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:
$11.00 * 20 = $220

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings:

"To find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, we need to add the number of each type of stuffed animal she has:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation to find the number of stuffed goats she needs:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats.
The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x.
The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so we can set up the equation:

( x / (14 + x) ) * 100 = 30

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get rid of the fraction:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."

Total hours played in the first 2 weeks = 2 * 7 * 0.5 = 7 hours

In the last week, Kris played for 7 days and 2 hours each day.
Total hours played in the last week = 7 * 2 = 14 hours

Total hours played = 7 + 14 = 21 hours

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, we subtract the hours she has already played from the required hours.
Hours left to play = 30 - 21 = 9 hours

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them.

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the premium first. 

The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold. 
The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 * $900 = $270.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the diamond and gold, and the premium. 
Total cost = $900 + $270 = $1170.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: 46%"
"To find the total number of square inches Milo can make with two bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many square inches he can make with one bag. 

Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, and there are 72 chips in a bag, we can divide 72 by 12 to find the number of square inches one bag can make:

72 / 12 = 6 square inches

Since Milo has two bags, we multiply the number of square inches one bag can make by 2:

6 * 2 = 12 square inches

Now, we know that Milo can make 12 square inches of mosaic with two bags. Since he wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we need to find the length of the mosaic. 

To do this, we can divide the total area (12 square inches) by the height (3 inches):

12 / 3 = 4 inches

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed = 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Now, to find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the consumed amount to the remaining amount.

Initial amount of tea = 10 (remaining) + 38 (consumed) = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, we can convert the initial amount of tea to gallons by dividing by 4.

Initial amount of tea in gallons = 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number he has already sold.

Dale initially had 100 candies and ordered 100 more, so he now has:
100 (initial candies) + 100 (additional candies) = 200 candies

He sold 150 candies, so he now has:
200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies

To sell all of his candies, Dale needs to sell:
200 (total candies) - 50 (candies he has left) = 150 candies

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the number of students on campus at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month.

- At the beginning of the year (January), there are 10 students.
- At the end of January, the number doubles to 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number doubles to 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number doubles to 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number doubles to 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number doubles to 320 students.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract this number from the total number of students at the end of May: 
320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find the total number of branches he climbed in a week. 

Since Felix made $105 in a week, and he charges $0.25 per branch, we can divide the total amount he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches he climbed:

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add the total number of petals for each type of flower: 
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract 1 for each type of flower:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 15 - 1 = 14 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 24 - 1 = 23 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 20 - 1 = 19 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 42 - 1 = 41 petals

Now, let's add the remaining petals for each type of flower: 
14 + 23 + 19 + 41 = 97 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 97."
"To find the total number of S'mores they can make, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 32.

John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

So, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person played and then multiply it by the cost per game.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per game, so in 4 hours (240 minutes), he plays 240 / 20 = 12 games.

One of his friends plays for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, they play 240 / 10 = 24 games.

The other friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, they play 240 / 30 = 8 games.

The total number of games played is 12 (Jack) + 24 (first friend) + 8 (second friend) = 44 games.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total cost is 44 * 0.25 = 11 dollars.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of salt as S, the amount of oil as O, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of citrus zest as Z, and the amount of sugar as G.

We know that:
- Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so Z = F.
- Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = G.
- Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.
- The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + O + F + Z + G = 10.

Substituting the given relationships into the total equation, we get:
S + 2S + S + S + G = 10
Combine like terms:
5S + G = 10

Since S = G, we can substitute G with S:
5S + S = 10
Combine like terms:
6S = 10

Divide both sides by 6:
S = 10/6
S = 5/3

Now that we know S, we can find O:
O = 2S
O = 2(5/3)
O = 10/3

So, Tanya uses 10/3 ounces of oil.

10/3"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500.

John spent $4500 at the market."
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already has = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already has
= 63 - 48
= 15

Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Now, Joe has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity.

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Now, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Number of students = 20

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day separately.

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.
3. When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.
4. To find the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a week and then multiply it by the payment per task.

Number of tasks per cycle = 5
Number of cycles per day = 30
Number of days in a week = 7

Total number of tasks per week = 5 * 30 * 7 = 1050

Payment per task = $1.20
Total payment per week = 1050 * $1.20 = $1260

"To find the total points Sasha scored, we need to calculate her points in both games.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total number of cards: 341
2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
3. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Then, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the sum of the cards of all three is 341. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for each week.

Week 1: 8,000 bars
Week 2: Half of Week 1 = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Week 3: Three times as much as Week 1 = 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Since the total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars, we can subtract this from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to cover the same distance as 3 kangaroos. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance.

Time taken by 4 turtles = Time taken by 3 kangaroos * 2
Time taken by 4 turtles = 18 hours * 2
Time taken by 4 turtles = 36 hours

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $80. So, the total amount she has now is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation: $230 + x = $400, where x is the amount she has in her purse.

To find x, we subtract $230 from both sides of the equation: x = $400 - $230.
x = $170.

So, Erika has $170 in her purse."

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used.
The length of the second glue stick that is not used is 1/3 * 12 = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used.
The length of the third glue stick that is not used is 1/2 * 12 = 6 mm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of socks Peter and Jack have.

Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing 60 by 2.

60 / 2 = 30

So, Jack has 30 socks.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can find the number of socks Peter has by multiplying 30 by 2.

30 * 2 = 60

So, Peter has 60 socks.

Now, we know that Jack has 60 dishes and Peter has twice as many dishes as Jack, so we can find the number of dishes Peter has by multiplying 60 by 2.

60 * 2 = 120

So, Peter has 120 dishes.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes.

60 (Peter's socks) + 120 (Peter's dishes) + 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 250

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 250."
"To find the number of students good at both math and English, we need to subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at math only = 5
Number of students good at English only = 8
Total number of students = 20

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total time available for performances. 

The total time for each group is 2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. 

Subtracting the time for the intermission (10 minutes) from the total time, we get 120 - 10 = 110 minutes.

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time per group (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

So, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year.

The interest earned in the first year is $225.
The principal amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.
The interest earned in the second year is 3/4 * $525 = $396.75.
The principal amount after the second year is $525 + $396.75 = $921.75.
The interest earned in the third year is 3/4 * $921.75 = $693.53.
The principal amount after the third year is $921.75 + $693.53 = $1615.28.

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1615.28."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - (Half of 40)
= 40 - 20
= 20

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.
Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the selling price per tray to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Selling price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats and Farm Y had 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The total number of goats left in the two farms is 70."
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

Total amount spent per year: $2640
Number of pairs bought per year: 2

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the actual cost of the red food will be $54 - $6 (2 * 3) = $48.

The total cost is $75 (green food) + $48 (red food) = $123.

Final answer: $123"
"To find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to first find the number of rooms that is one-half of 90.

One-half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. You are 3 years younger than your brother.
2. You are 2 years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of your ages is 87.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. Then, your brother's age is x + 3, and your sister's age is x - 2.

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so it's 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, we can write the equation based on the sum of your ages: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, it's not necessary because the question asks for a numerical answer."
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we need to divide the total number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8). 

27 ÷ 8 = 3.375

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. 

So, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 4 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add it to the total number of infected people.

Day 1:
- 10 people are initially infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 1: 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

Day 2:
- 70 people are infected from Day 1.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 70 * 6 = 420 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 2: 70 (previous) + 420 (new) = 490.

Day 3:
- 490 people are infected from Day 2.
- Each infected person infects 6 others, so 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections.
- Total infected after Day 3: 490 (previous) + 2940 (new) = 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we need to calculate the amount of tips each received.

Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, so she received 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, which is 90% of Rafaela's tips. 90% of $800 is 0.9 * $800 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta is $800 + $720 = $1520.

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer had left, we need to subtract the total number of oranges she gave away from the total number she initially bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges.
She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so she gave away 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.
She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

Total oranges given away = 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:
12 - 9 = 3

Jennifer has 3 oranges left."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of slices, we need to calculate the total number of loaves first. Since Paige baked for 5 hours, and she bakes 2 loaves per hour, she baked 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.

Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised is 80 * 0.50 = $40.

The final answer is $40."
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen had, we need to first find the number of silver coins. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation: 
Let's say the number of silver coins is x. 
Then, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation: 
x + 30 = 70

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 70 - 30 
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins: 
Total coins = 40 (silver) + 70 (gold) 
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. 
Total burritos given to students = 50 * 10 = 500

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 
Total burritos eaten = 20

Now, we subtract the total burritos eaten from the total burritos given to the students to find the leftover burritos.
Total leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Total burritos eaten
Total leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Total leftover burritos = 480

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480."
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know the total number of cars is 75. We have already found the number of red, green, and blue cars. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

75 - 12 (red) - 10 (green) - 30 (blue) = 23

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has.

Let's say Fawn has x books.
Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.
Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2.

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Now, we know that the carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes to find the weight of the carrots.

Weight of carrots = weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

The final answer is 7."

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy.

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10
Number of boxes needed: 120 / 10 = 12

Now, we need to find out the total cost. We know the price of one box is $1.25.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays 40% of the total cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the amount Keenan pays in a month by 4 to find out how much he spends per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40 per week.

The final answer is $40."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

First, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we multiply 60 by 2/5.

60 * (2/5) = 24

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the first day from the total number of pieces.

60 - 24 = 36

Now, he has 36 pieces left.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, we subtract 10 from 36.

36 - 10 = 26

Now, he has 26 pieces left.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find out how many pieces he ate, we multiply 26 by 7/13.

26 * (7/13) = 14.31 (approximately)

Since we can't eat a fraction of a piece, we'll round down to 14 pieces.

Now, let's subtract the pieces he ate on the third day from the remaining pieces.

26 - 14 = 12

So, Tobias has eaten 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces in total.

The final answer is 48."

"To find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell, we need to calculate 3/5 of 300.

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 each, the total amount of money he will make is:

180 * 50 = $9000

However, Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he needs to sell the chickens for, we need to add the desired profit to the total amount he will make:

$9000 + $2000 = $11000

Now, we need to find out how much Isaias paid for the 180 chickens. To do this, we can divide the total amount he needs to sell the chickens for by the number of chickens:

$11000 / 180 = $61.11

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $61.11 each."
"To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 3, since there are 3 people selling lemonade. 

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. 

Let's assume her age in x years will be 3 times her present age. 

3 * 8 = 24
x = 24

Since x is the number of years from now, we need to subtract 8 (her present age) from 24 to get the number of years from now.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we multiply 75 by 2/3: 
75 * 2/3 = 50

Now, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants: 
75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: 
(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x meters per second.

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob (x), we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob:

Whirligig speed = 5x
Whirligig speed = 5 * 11
Whirligig speed = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the cost of one carrot, we need to first find the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The cost of the salad is $6. 
The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"To find Mark's new hourly wage, we need to add the $2 raise to his original hourly wage.

New hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we need to multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week.

Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $12 * 40
Weekly earnings = $480

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

Since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is 3x + 5x + x = 9x.

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed Joe's lawn x times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x.

We know that the total amount she made from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. 

So, 6x + 80 = 80

Subtracting 80 from both sides, we get:
6x = 0

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:
x = 0

Since x = 0, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn zero times, which means she didn't make any money from mowing lawns. 

Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80.

80"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find John's profit, we need to calculate his total monthly income and subtract his car payment.

First, let's calculate his total monthly income:
Number of rentals per month: 10
Hours per rental: 3
Total hours per month: 10 * 3 = 30 hours
Hourly wage: $25
Total monthly income: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, let's subtract his car payment:
Car payment: $500
Total monthly income: $750
Profit: $750 - $500 = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

3x = 7

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33

So Joseph initially had 2.33 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. To do this, we subtract Joseph's initial number of notebooks from Martha's current number of notebooks:

7 (Martha's notebooks) - 2.33 (Joseph's notebooks) = 4.67

So, Martha now has 4.67 more notebooks than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to calculate Anis' distance first. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:
Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we first need to subtract the cookies that Susan's husband took from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To find out how many pages Denise read more than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 
Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. 
Daniel read 0 pages today.

Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel. 
Denise read 18 pages and Daniel read 0 pages. 
So, Denise read 18 - 0 = 18 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to first calculate the total number of bowls of soup Calvin has. 

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls, we can say that the pot can fill 4x = 8 bowls. 

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 adults. 

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, Calvin can have 4 bowls for himself and his wife. This leaves 0 bowls for the children.

However, the question asks about lunch, not dinner. Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, Calvin can have 0 bowls for himself and his wife for lunch, leaving 8 bowls for the children.

Now, since there are 2 children, we can divide the 8 bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. 

8 / 2 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

"To find the total material needed, we need to calculate the material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
Number of small masks = 20
Material needed for 1 small mask = 2 yards
Total material needed for 20 small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards

For large masks:
Number of large masks = 8
Material needed for 1 large mask = 2.25 yards
Total material needed for 8 large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards

Total material needed = 40 yards (for small masks) + 18 yards (for large masks) = 58 yards

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the average price per ticket, we need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

Total amount spent = $216

The average price per ticket is $8."
"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

"To find the number of red shoeboxes left, we need to calculate 2/3 of the total red shoeboxes, since 1/3 were used.

Total red shoeboxes = 9
Red shoeboxes used = 1/3 * 9 = 3
Red shoeboxes left = 9 - 3 = 6

Total blue shoeboxes used = 3
Total blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

So, the number of red shoeboxes left is 6 and the number of blue shoeboxes left is 4.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away.

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows:

1/5 * 30 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

Now, we need to add the 10 marbles he gave to Donald:

6 (given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

2. We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation: D - 8 = 2(A - 4).

3. We are given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can substitute D = 60 into the equation: 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4).

4. Simplify the equation: 52 = 2A - 8.

5. Add 8 to both sides of the equation: 60 = 2A.

6. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: A = 30.

7. Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years: A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38.

"To find the total number of acres, we need to first find the number of acres on Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Since Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of both farms is 700."
"To find out how many packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes per hour. 

He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a typical 8-hour workday.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, his total earnings for the day will be 320 * 0.20 = $64.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Now, we know that Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. To find the number of yellow balloons, we can divide the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons (18) by 3. 

18 / 3 = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days.

Total miles driven = miles driven per day * number of days
Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3

Now, let's add up the hours worked each day:
5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours

The total hours worked by Bruce in these three days is 23."
"To find out how much money Julia and Nadine had, we need to calculate the total amount they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

1. The cake costs $11.
2. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since each balloon costs $0.5, the total cost of the balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent: $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find out how much each of them had initially. 

$31 / 2 = $15.5

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 1/3 x 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has:

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to first find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can divide 8 hours by 4 hours to find the number of round trips he can make in 8 hours.

8 hours / 4 hours per round trip = 2 round trips

Since the sloth makes a round trip (down and back up), we need to multiply the number of round trips by 2 to find the total number of trips.

2 round trips * 2 = 4 trips

Now, we know the sloth can make 4 trips in 8 hours. To find the least number of berries he can pick per trip, we can divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of trips.

24 berries / 4 trips = 6 berries per trip

The final answer is 6."
"To find the amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate half of the pool's water capacity, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, we can calculate the amount of water remaining after 6 days by subtracting 500 gallons for each day from the initial amount in the tank.

Initial amount in the tank = 5000 gallons
Daily emptying rate = 500 gallons
Number of days = 6

Remaining water after 6 days = Initial amount - (Daily emptying rate * Number of days)
= 5000 - (500 * 6)
= 5000 - 3000
= 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn (2 tubs) and $8 on candy (4 boxes), so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, so he has spent $10 * 5 = $50 on tickets. 

Now, he has $134 - $50 = $84 left.

To find out how many more movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since tickets for any other day cost $7, we'll use that price for the remaining movies. 

$84 / $7 = 12

So, Colby can see 12 more movies.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked are 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are 2 days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 * 5
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 * 8
Distance = 240 miles

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 - 240
Difference = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to create equations.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as A, and Jean's age as J.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + A + J = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: A = J + 10
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: P = A + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: P = (J + 10) + J
Simplifying, we get: P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2J + 10) + A + J = 100
Substituting A = J + 10, we get: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100
Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80
Divide by 4: J = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age: A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
And finally, we can find Peter's age: P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is:
4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons
Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes:
8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial balloons and the additional balloons:
9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

The total number of balloons the girls have is 24."
"To find the total number of boxes, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already own.

Donated boxes: 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes
Existing boxes: 10 boxes
Total boxes: 50 + 10 = 60 boxes

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find the number of tables needed.

Number of tables needed: 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

Since they already have 15 tables, we need to subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed to find the new tables required.

New tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables."

Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets
Total money from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

To find the difference in the total amount of money Fern will make from the two machines, we subtract the total money from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the total money from the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the extended stay.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is 250."
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we need to calculate the amount of hay each goat and sheep needs.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, so each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep:
15 goats * 5 pounds = 75 pounds
12 sheep * 7 pounds = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To find out how much John earned, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked: 
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

John spent 50 dollars on gas and 10 dollars on pencils, so we subtract these from his earnings: 
300 dollars - 50 dollars - 10 dollars = 240 dollars.

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract this from his remaining money: 
240 dollars - 100 dollars = 140 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with 140 dollars. 
140 dollars / 25 dollars = 5.6.

Since John can't buy a fraction of a pen, we round down to 5 pens.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 
20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total: 
300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To find the total number of children, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows.

Number of children in each row = 8

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students.

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is:
9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the fixed charge and the cost of parts.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

Total fixed charge = $40

Cost of parts = $60

Total cost = Labor cost + Total fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs. 

The original price of the CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James got them for 40% off, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

So, James paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He then sells 5 CDs for $40 each. 
The total amount he gets from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James is left with, we subtract the amount he paid from the amount he got from selling the CDs.
$200 - $90 = $110.

So, James is left with $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of crop and then add them together.

For yams: 6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9
For sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20
For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, let's add the total revenue from each crop: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the distance James swims at 2 miles per hour.
Distance = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance = 12 miles

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends swimming 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Step 5: Calculate the remaining distance James has to swim.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Step 6: Calculate the speed at which James swims the remaining distance.
New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour

Step 7: Calculate the time James spends swimming the remaining distance.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 8: Calculate the total time James takes to get across the lake.
Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to first find seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events:

1. She starts with 15 stickers.
2. She loses 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.
3. She receives 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end."
"To find the total commission, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper and then add them together.

Commission for the New York Times: 
6 copies * 10% * $5 = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3

Commission for the Wall Street Journal: 
10 copies * 8% * $15 = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12

Total commission:

"To find Leo's age, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. 

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up the equation: 
Marcus's age = 0.5 * Leo's age
21 = 0.5 * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can divide both sides by 0.5:
Leo's age = 21 / 0.5
Leo's age = 42

The final answer is 42."
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first find out how many points Dinar scored. 

Let's denote Dinar's points as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points will be x + 10. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's points will be (x + 10) - 20 = x - 10.

We also know that the total points of the three teams is 45. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3: x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points: Azibo's points = x - 10 = 15 - 10 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 3 pages

The final answer is 3."
"To find the total number of reports stapled, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. 
15 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of sets of 15 minutes.

900 minutes / 15 minutes per set = 60 sets

Since each set contains 30 reports, we multiply the number of sets by 30.

60 sets * 30 reports per set = 1800 reports

Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find the total number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she slept and subtract the time she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the total time she slept. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. 

8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we need to subtract those 5 minutes.

480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time she was sleepwalking. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am. We need to convert this to minutes.

2 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes
15 minutes + 120 minutes = 135 minutes

Now, we add the time she was sleepwalking to the time she woke up early.

475 minutes + 135 minutes = 610 minutes

The final answer is: 610"
"To find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has, we need to calculate 2/3 of the number of measuring cups he has. 

Since he has two dozen cups, we first need to convert two dozen to a numerical value. Two dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 cups.

Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups: 
2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups. 

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To find the initial number of occupied beds, we need to calculate 1/5 of 1000 beds.

1/5 of 1000 = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

So, initially, there are 200 occupied beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds increases by 50 each day.

In 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:
200 + (50 * 14) = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Now, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:
1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find out how many emails are not work emails. 
   Total emails per day = 16
   Work emails per day = 7
   Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
   Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
   Non-work emails per day = 9

2. Now, we find out how many of the non-work emails are to family.
   Emails to family per day = 2/3 * Non-work emails per day
   Emails to family per day = 2/3 * 9
   Emails to family per day = 6

3. Now, we find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend.
   Emails to boyfriend per day = 1/3 * Non-work emails per day
   Emails to boyfriend per day = 1/3 * 9
   Emails to boyfriend per day = 3

The final answer is 3."
"To find Shawna's age, we need to multiply Aliya's age by 3, since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. 

Aliya is 3 years old, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we multiply Shawna's age by 5 to find her father's age.

Shawna's father is 9 * 5 = 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the original number reported by Courtney (48) and subtract it from the original number.

20% of 48 = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the correct number of people who attended the concert:

48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of balls that Jeffrey picked up and carried. 

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up an equation: 
Jason's balls = 2 * Jeffrey's balls
2 = 2 * Jeffrey's balls
Jeffrey's balls = 1

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up another equation:
Jordan's balls = 2 * Jason's balls
Jordan's balls = 2 * 2
Jordan's balls = 4

Now, we know that the total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day and then determine how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the actual number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 29 = 116.

Since the pirates had already dug 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 116 - 29 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many corn chips Collins received. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, Collins received 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so together they got 70 + 70 = 140 corn chips. Since there are only three people, the total number of corn chips is the sum of what Amora, Lainey, and Collins got. 

So, the total number of corn chips is 140 (Amora and Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225.

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that:
1. X = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13

We also know that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so:
A + S + X = 339

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get:
A + (4A - 13) + (A + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
6A - 8 = 339
Add 8 to both sides:
6A = 347
Divide by 6:
A = 57.83 (round down to 57 since you can't catch a fraction of a Pokémon)

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(57) - 13
S = 228 - 13
S = 215

The final answer is 215."
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time spent watching the show.

Total time spent watching the show = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time spent watching the show = 10 * 20
Total time spent watching the show = 200

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then add them together.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird is traveling in a southerly direction for the first 300 miles and then a northerly direction for 36 miles, we need to subtract the distance traveled in the second direction from the distance traveled in the first direction to find the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The bird then travels 110 miles in the southerly direction, so the total distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

The bird's northern home is 374 miles away from her southern home.

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had, we need to calculate the number of brownies she received and subtract the number eaten.

She initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party, which is 6 brownies.

Her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies she received: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the number eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"To find the total age of the family members, we need to calculate the age of each member.

Nani is 8 years old.
His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members:
8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years."

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can represent the number of players in Zeke's team as 13 + 7 = 20.

Now, we add the number of players in both teams: 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33.

The total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given length = 15 feet and width = 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box.

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

She gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the initial number of boxes to find out how many boxes she had left.

240 - 4 = 236 boxes

Since she kept 1/4 of the oranges, we need to find 1/4 of 236 boxes.

1/4 * 236 = 59 boxes

Now, we subtract the boxes she kept from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes she sold.

236 - 59 = 177 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we multiply the number of boxes she sold by the number of oranges per box.

177 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 3540 oranges

The final answer is: 3540"
"To find the total number of states in both countries, we need to first find the number of states in the USA and then add 4 to it.

The number of states in the USA is 50.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate half of 50 as 25. Then, we add 4 to get 29.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA (50) to the number of states in India (29) to get the total number of states in both countries.

50 + 29 = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has saved.

Total cost of the books = cost of dictionary + cost of dinosaur book + cost of children's cookbook

"To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard has. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation: 
Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries from the total number of cherries shared (60) and subtracting Robert's cherries:
Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday and Sunday, we need to follow the given information:

- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 6 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $90

Total earnings for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150
Total earnings for Sunday: $90 + $90 = $180

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = D/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12, so the sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads each person gave her and add them together.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:
21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 
20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 
30 - 6 = 24 students

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 
25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 
6 + 6 = 12 students

The final answer is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. 

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding their sizes and dividing by 2. 

Average size = (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by the two is 15."
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches and then divide it by the width of each plant plus the space between them.

First, convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches: 
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, calculate the total space each plant occupies: 
12 inches (plant width) + 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot (space between plants) = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches

Now, divide the total length of the flower bed in inches by the space each plant occupies: 
1332 inches / 30 inches = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be: 
27 flowers * $6/flower = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to first find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. 

Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

9 pretzels a day * 7 days a week = 63 pretzels a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

Cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
Cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00
Total cost = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses."
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income.

25% of $2,000 = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since she sets aside $500 each month, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

$500 * 12 = $6,000

Now, we need to divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy.

$6,000 / $1,000 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To find the time it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to first find out how many minutes it takes her to peel and cook 30 shrimp, and then multiply that time by 3.

Since Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can say that she can peel 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. 

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp: 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

So, it takes Emily 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp. 

Now, we need to add the time it takes to cook the shrimp. Since it takes 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp, we can multiply 10 by 3 to get the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp: 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Emily 15 + 30 = 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. 

First, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner running on low for 3 hours:
3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the total cooling effect of the air conditioner running on high for 4 hours:
4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

The net cooling effect is the difference between the cooling effect on high and the cooling effect on low:
12 degrees - 6 degrees = 6 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, the room will warm up for 2 hours after the air conditioner is turned off. 
2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

The final temperature is the initial temperature minus the net cooling effect plus the warming effect:
Final temperature = Initial temperature - net cooling effect + warming effect
Final temperature = Initial temperature - 6 degrees + 4 degrees
Final temperature = Initial temperature - 2 degrees

Since we don't know the initial temperature, we can say the final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as 'x'. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when Bill was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as (x - 30).

Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can set up the equation:

x = 3 * (x - 30)

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 3x - 90
x - 3x = -90
-2x = -90
x = 45

So, Bill was 45 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks he writes per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. Checks for electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. 

Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, it makes 3/4x flights to Greece. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so it makes 1/4x flights to France and 1/4x flights to Germany.

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips.

We are given that the number of flights to Poland is half the number of flights made by the first plane, so we can set up the equation:

44 = 1/2x

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

88 = x

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

Number of flights to France = 1/4x
= 1/4 * 88
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the time each wolf howls and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam bought the trousers for $30. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

$30 - $18 = $12

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know the total age of the children is 20.
2. We know Akbar's age is 3 and Alessandro's age is 4.
3. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.
4. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.
5. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write the equation: H = 2 * 5 = 10.
6. Now we know Helene's age is 10.
7. We can now write the equation for the total age: 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20.
8. Solving for W, we get: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected so far is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, we need to find out how much his lawyer will contribute based on this amount.

However, the problem states that Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This means that Walter's total amount will be $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else, we can calculate the amount by multiplying the total amount ($2200) by 3.

$2200 * 3 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

6600"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to calculate 1/2 of 100 guests multiplied by 15 cookies per guest.

1/2 of 100 guests = 50 guests
50 guests * 15 cookies = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices. Since there are 6 people in total, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, let's assume the kid's slice is x. Then, the adult's slice is 2x.

Since there are 4 kids, the total number of kid's slices is 4x. The total number of adult slices is 2 (for the 2 adults). 

The total number of slices is 4x + 2. 

Since the total number of slices is equal to the total number of people, we can set up the equation: 4x + 2 = 6.

Solving for x, we get: 
4x = 6 - 2
4x = 4
x = 1

So, each kid gets 1 slice, and each adult gets 2 slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the total number of slices that each adult gets, and then convert it to a percentage.

Each adult gets 2 slices out of a total of 6 slices. The fraction is 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3.

To convert the fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 33.33% of the watermelon."
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the time it takes to make the cake.

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

"To find the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa and Peter, we need to add the number of boxes they sold. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can divide 64 by 8 to find the number of chocolate bars in a box.

64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons for a month.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:

- The cost of renting the studio per week is $25.
- The cost of renting the studio for 3 days a week is $25 * 3 = $75.
- The cost of renting the studio for the remaining 4 days is $25 * 4 = $100.
- The total weekly cost of renting the studio is $75 + $100 = $175.

Next, let's calculate the weekly cost of the students' lessons:

- The cost of renting the studio is $1.50 per student per session.
- The dance studio has 10 students.
- The cost of the students' lessons per week is $1.50 * 10 = $15.
- The total weekly cost of the students' lessons is $15.

Now, let's calculate the total weekly cost:

- The total weekly cost is $175 (renting the studio) + $15 (students' lessons) = $190.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total monthly cost is:

- $190 * 4 = $760.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $760."
"To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so the number of chocolate bars in each box is 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference, subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population.

Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

To find the total number of new porcupines in a year, we multiply the number of new porcupines per month by 12.

Total new porcupines in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the initial population of porcupines to the total number of new porcupines in a year to find the final population.

Final population = 50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

The final population of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume * 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons * 0.10
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"

"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 220 miles

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles
Difference = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to break down the information given.

First, let's find the number of students over 16 years old: 
Half of 3000 students are over 16 years old, so 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so 1500 / 4 = 375 students are male over 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 years old: 
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

Next, let's find the number of students under 16 years old: 
3000 - 1500 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, so 1500 / 2 = 750 students are male under 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of female students under 16 years old: 
1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the first 5 hours and the last 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is 100%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:
100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%

Now, in the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:
55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation to find the initial charge:
100% - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
100% - 45% - 21% = 28%
34% = 28%

However, this equation is not correct. We need to find the initial charge. Let's re-evaluate the equation:
100% - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) = 28%
100% - 45% - 21% = 34% (not 28%)
Let's re-evaluate the equation again:
100% - (9% * 5) - (7% * x) = 28%
100% - 45% - (7% * x) = 28%
55% - (7% * x) = 28%
(7% * x) = 27%
x = 27% / 7%
x = 3.86%

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 100% - 3.86% = 96.14%.

"To find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours per week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 * $0.75 = $3
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he already bought: $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar started with $10, the amount of money he has left is $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, this is not possible since he can't spend more than he has. This means he can't buy any more fruits.

The final answer is 0."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we need to first find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

There are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13.

Since she gave the sweets equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of sweets by 10. 

900 / 10 = 90.

So, each of Anne's friends received 90 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase each year.

Year 1: 
Initial price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2:
Initial price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3:
Initial price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfies.

3 * 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portraits.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

18
27"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to first find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. 

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to get the time it takes to read one page. 

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read one page by the total number of pages James read. 

3.33 minutes per page * 18 pages = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To find the number of guests the hotel has now, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the remaining number of guests is 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the remaining number of guests is 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 people checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.
5. The total number of guests now is 61 (remaining after early and late checkouts) + 30 (new check-ins) = 91.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

John has 22 bananas."
"To find the number of easy questions, we multiply 60 by 40% (or 0.4). 
60 * 0.4 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we divide the remaining questions by 2.
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9.

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals as L and the number of small stuffed animals as S.

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. If we denote the price of a small stuffed animal as P, then the price of a large stuffed animal is 3P.

We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so P = $4.

Now, we know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so S = 2L.

We are also given that the total earnings from the sales are $120. The total earnings can be calculated as the sum of the earnings from large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals:

Total earnings = (3P * L) + (P * S)
= (3 * 4 * L) + (4 * 2L)
= 12L + 8L
= 20L

Since the total earnings are $120, we can set up the equation:

20L = 120

To find the value of L, we can divide both sides by 20:

L = 120 / 20
L = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

S = 2L
= 2 * 6
= 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day and then multiply it by 7.

The total number of sandwiches eaten per day is: 
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day

Now, multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 * $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 * $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To find the number of eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found and the number of eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs.

Total eggs = 100
Eggs found by Smith twins = 30
Eggs not found = 10

Eggs found by friends = Total eggs - Eggs found by Smith twins - Eggs not found
= 100 - 30 - 10
= 60

The friends found 60 eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

Since one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes, we multiply 36 by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day.

To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days), we multiply 1440 by 30: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich in the first two packages and then use that to calculate the price of the third package.

The price per sandwich in the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
The price per sandwich in the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by 8:
$1.50 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
   40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

   Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
   Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

   Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6

3. Calculate the number of blue balloons added:
   75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

   Total balloons = red + yellow + blue = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the following scenarios:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of extension)
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 60% (100% - 40% chance of no extension)
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 100% (no chance of extension)

Now, we need to calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework. We can do this by adding the probabilities of each scenario:

Probability of normal teacher and no extension: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36
Probability of normal teacher and extension: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
Probability of substitute teacher: 0.5

Now, we add the probabilities: 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.5 = 1.1

However, since the probabilities must add up to 1 (or 100%), we can simplify the result by subtracting the excess from 1:

1.1 - 1 = 0.1

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.1 * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 10%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000
Reserved seats for graduates = 950
Reserved seats for faculty = 300
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total reserved seats from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 4750 remaining seats, and there are 950 graduates, we can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

Final answer: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium-sized beans as follows:

Number of medium-sized beans = 2 * Number of large beans
= 2 * 75
= 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we can divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

Number of small beans = Number of medium-sized beans / 3
= 150 / 3
= 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

50"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total daily earnings and then subtract her parking expenses.

Total daily earnings: $15 per day
Total daily expenses: $3 per day
Total daily net earnings: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Total hours worked: 6 hours per day * 3 days = 18 hours

Total jury pay: $12 per day * 18 hours = $216

Jury pay per hour: $216 / 18 hours = $12 per hour

"To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next.

The total width of the driveway is 24 feet, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of moves by the time it takes to move:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To find the total number of apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box:

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is $10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school and the total amount of money he earned after graduating.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school:
Total amount of money lost = Number of years in school * Annual income before college
Total amount of money lost = 4 years * $25,000/year
Total amount of money lost = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim earned after graduating:
Total amount of money earned = Number of years in school * Annual income after college
Total amount of money earned = 4 years * $75,000/year (since his income tripled)
Total amount of money earned = $300,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to repay the loans:
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = Total amount of money lost + Total amount of money earned
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = $100,000 + $300,000
Total amount of money needed to repay loans = $400,000

Since Jim gets $50,000 in loans per year, we can calculate the number of years it would take him to repay the loans:
Number of years to repay loans = Total amount of money needed to repay loans / Annual loan amount
Number of years to repay loans = $400,000 / $50,000/year
Number of years to repay loans = 8 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the total area of fabric needed, we need to calculate the area of the two pieces of fabric separately and then add them together.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so they will be 8 feet long by 10 feet wide.

The area of the first piece of fabric is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.
The area of the second piece of fabric is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to multiply the total area by 2.
Total area = 80 + 80 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, Tuesday's delivery is 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. 
Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, Wednesday's delivery is 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"To find the average amount lost, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, he lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Average amount lost = Total amount lost / Number of races = $21.5 / 3 = $7.17

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches
So, Xavier's new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:
Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
= 52 inches - 51 inches
= 1 inch

"To find the share of the first person, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 576.67

So the first person took $576.67.

576.67"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's find the total hours worked by the team. Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert the fraction to decimal and multiply it by the number of days in 3 weeks.

3 weeks = 21 days
3/8 = 0.375

Total hours worked by the team = 0.375 * 21 = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:

Hours worked by each painter = 7.875 / 4 = 1.96875 hours

The final answer is 1.96875."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we need to multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Initial price of the car in 2007: $20,000
Depreciation rate: 21% per year

Year 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,620.82
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,620.82 = $9,861.18

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,861.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we need to first find the total number of non-Spanish books. 

Half of the 50 books are written in English, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

"To find the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72
Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we multiply the increased cost by 12.

$192 * 12 = $2304

James pays $2304 a year for insurance."
"To find the total number of loads, we need to calculate the number of loads for each type of bed and then add them together.

Number of twin beds: 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads
Number of king beds: 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, we need to divide the total number of twin loads by 2:
208 twin loads / 2 = 104 twin loads

Now, we add the number of king loads to the adjusted twin loads:
104 twin loads + 52 king loads = 156 loads

The total number of loads is 156."

Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add the stickers from all three years: 100 (two years ago) + 150 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 350 stickers.

Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount fed per day (60 grams).

720 grams / 60 grams per day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, we can find the total number of slices they ate by adding up the slices each of them ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The final answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each component and add them together.

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the visit: 30 minutes is half of an hour, so the cost is $300/hour * 0.5 = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: 30 painkillers * $4/pill = $120
4. The cost of parking: 2 hours * $6/hour = $12

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find the number of emails James responds to, we need to first find the number of emails that don't require a response. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James responds to the rest of the emails, we subtract the non-responding emails from the total number of emails. 

80 - 16 = 64 emails.

James responds to 64 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and add them together.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

The total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, 80

First, let's add up the scores: 
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, let's divide the total by the number of tests: 
380 / 4 = 95

The average score is 95."
"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas each group ate and subtract that from the total number of pizzas.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The total cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The total cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is the sum of the cost of mailing small and big coupons: 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents.

To convert the total cost to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so the number of sub sandwiches left is 7 - 4 = 3.
3. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6.
4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser, we need to calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched.

A quarter of 20 trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons.

The total number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons.

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To find the total cost of the butter, we need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs and then apply the discount.

Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. So, he needs 6 * 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds. 

6 pounds / 2 pounds per group = 3 groups

Since each group costs 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 pounds.

The cost of 4.5 pounds of butter is 4.5 * $4.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of guests first. 

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. However, 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. 

Number of additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Cost = $125 + ($6 * 21) = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially, we need to find the total amount of money they had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is 60 + 60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * 60 = $15. 
Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * 60 = $20.

The amount of money Maggie has left is 60 - 15 = $45.
The amount of money Riza has left is 60 - 20 = $40.

The total amount of money they have left is 45 + 40 = $85.

The final answer is 85."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas each monkey eats in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
10 bananas/day * 7 days = 70 bananas
14 bananas/day * 7 days = 98 bananas

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is:
315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas

The third monkey eats 147 bananas / 7 days = 21 bananas per day.

"To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the number of pieces he placed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he placed in the second 500-piece puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

In the second 500-piece puzzle, he placed all 500 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

"To find out how many quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then subtract that from the amount of money she has.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses:
15 roses * $2 per rose = $30

Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can also calculate the cost of 15 roses as follows:
15 roses / 12 = 1.25 dozen roses
1.25 * $15 = $18.75

Now, let's subtract the cost of the roses from the amount of money Jenny has:

"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and then add them together.

Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total sales together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

Terry makes $162 in total."
"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time between each train's arrival and departure.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time between the first train's arrival and departure is 20 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 10 + 30 = 40 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time between the second train's arrival and departure is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 40 + 60 = 100 minutes after the first train's arrival. Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, the time between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 100 + 20 = 120 minutes after the first train's arrival.

Now, we need to add up the waiting time for each train:
- Waiting for the first train: 20 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: 40 - 20 = 20 minutes
- Waiting for the third train: 100 - 40 = 60 minutes
- Waiting for the fourth train: 120 - 100 = 20 minutes

Total waiting time = 20 + 20 + 60 + 20 = 120 minutes

"To find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far, we need to multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) by the number of weeks she has been saving (12).

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs.

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks.

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

"To find the original price, we need to calculate 100% of the sale price. 

Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so we multiply 2000 by 0.75 to get the sale price: 
2000 * 0.75 = 1500

Now, we need to find the original price. Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, we can set up the equation:
75% of x = 1500
0.75x = 1500
x = 1500 / 0.75
x = 2000

The original price of the watch is $2000.

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. 
120% of 1500 is 1.2 * 1500 = 1800.

To find the percentage discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, then divide by the original price and multiply by 100.
Discount = ((2000 - 1800) / 2000) * 100
Discount = (200 / 2000) * 100
Discount = 0.1 * 100
Discount = 10%

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by each spring in 4 hours and then multiply it by 5.

Since a spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it creates 60 jellyfish (60 seconds * 1 jellyfish/second). 

In 4 hours, it would create 240 jellyfish (60 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours).

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be 5 * 240 = 1200 jellyfish.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, he walked 2 miles to the store (half of 4 miles). 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time to walk to the store = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, he has to walk back home, which is also 2 miles. 

Time to walk back home = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

Total time = Time to walk to the store + Time to walk back home
Total time = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of buying 40 bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Since there are 10 bunches, the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence that Sam and Harry will get. 

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount of fence Sam gets from the total amount of fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The answer is 80."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4). 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we can multiply the rate of growth per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of a Trekking bike
= 150 * 450
= 67500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of a BMX bike
= 45 * 250
= 11250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of an MTB
= 105 * 500
= 52500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= 67500 + 11250 + 52500
= 132500

"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the total number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week.

Number of classes per week: 5 days * 2 classes/day = 10 classes
Total minutes per class: 40 minutes
Total minutes per week: 10 classes * 40 minutes/class = 400 minutes

Since John also spends extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends on these days.

Extra learning time per day: 1/16 * 60 minutes = 3.75 minutes
Total extra learning time per week: 3.75 minutes/day * 2 days = 7.5 minutes

Now, we can find the total minutes John spends learning per week:
Total minutes per week: 400 minutes + 7.5 minutes = 407.5 minutes

To convert the total minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
407.5 minutes / 60 = 6.79 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories, which is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached after the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to follow the given information step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is 72."
"To find the total earnings, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the total number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, we multiply the total number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"To find the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards.

The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, and the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the velociraptors ate 270 kilograms, which is half of the remaining meat.

To find the total amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate, we need to multiply 270 by 2 (since the velociraptors ate half of it).

270 * 2 = 540 kilograms

Now, the T-Rex ate half of the original amount. So, the T-Rex ate 540 kilograms, which is half of the original amount.

To find the original amount, we need to multiply 540 by 2.

540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

Final answer: 1080"
"To find the total area of the walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, we add the total area of all four walls: 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is $12 per gallon, so the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144.

"To find the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda, we need to calculate the probability of the friend picking a shaken soda.

Initially, there were 12 sodas in total. Ellen shook 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken and 3 shaken.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 1 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas out of a total of 3 sodas. 

The probability of Ellen's friend picking a shaken soda is 2/3.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/3) * 100 = 66.67%

The final answer is 66.67."
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. 

Total distance = 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the total number of days he is available and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 6 days off.

So, Billy is available for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of available days by the number of people he can help per day: 25 * 6 = 150.

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide:
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide."
"To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this total time per day, we need to multiply it by the number of days.

1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours

"To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5. 

Amber ran 8 miles, so Micah ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance covered by all three is 52 miles. We can subtract the distances covered by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

1. The item that was returned is $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

2. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 20% (or 0.20): $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00. The new price of the frying pan is $16.00.

3. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 10% (or 0.10): $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. Then, we subtract the discount from the original price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00. The new price of the towels is $27.00.

Now, we add the new prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since the total number of jellyfish is x, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that 6 jellyfish are large and change color. Since x/15 jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The final answer is: 90"

3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

Caroline is 24 years old."
"To find out how much Lauren saves each year, we need to calculate 20% of her current salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be a mistake in the question. Assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses, let's recalculate.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, we can calculate the total amount she needs to save for 20 years:

$20,000 * 20 years = $400,000.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings to find out how many years she needs to work:

$400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save the required amount. Since she already has a 20-year retirement period, we need to subtract this from the total number of years she needs to work:

20 years (total) - 20 years (retirement) = 0 years.

This means Lauren needs to work for 0 years to save the required amount, but since she can't work for 0 years, we can assume she needs to work for at least 20 years to save the required amount and then take her 20-year retirement.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). 
   100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per part

2. Then, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be further divided into (5).
   25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per final cut

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To find the total population of the school, we can set up a proportion. 

Let's say the total population is x. We know that 40% of x is equal to 240 boys. 

0.4x = 240

To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height of these heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of heels, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we need to divide the total miles she wants to hike (9,300 miles) by the number of days in June (30 days). 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to find the difference between the required miles per day and the miles she is already planning to hike.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since Jacques is not mentioned in the question, we assume it's a typo and the question is actually asking about Pierre and Paul. 

So, Pierre and Paul together have 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

The amount left for Jacques is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. 

Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, so she had $16 - $4 = $12 left. However, she also spent $2 on the books, so she actually had $12 - $2 = $10 left. But we know she had $2 left, so the $2 must be the amount she had after buying the books. This means she spent $10 - $2 = $8 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on the books ($8) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

$8 ÷ 2 = $4

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute.

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so the rate is 255 / 5 = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can divide the total number of blinks (459) by the rate (51 blinks per minute) to find the total time:

459 / 51 = 9 minutes

"To find the total number of male and female fish, we need to add the initial number of fish and the number of fish Tate bought.

Initial male guppies: 4
Initial female guppies: 7
Initial male goldfishes: 3
Initial female goldfishes: 5

Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fish:
Total male fish: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfish) = 11
Total female fish: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfish) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fish, subtract the total number of male fish from the total number of female fish:
16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance and then multiply it by 2 (since he visits his parents twice a month).

The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance he drives in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since she walks 10 miles per day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days to get the total distance walked by Sofie in 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we need to divide the total distance walked by Sofie by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk in 7 days.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour work for 10 hours, so they produce 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Since 4 workers produced 200 toys, the 5th worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the number of toys the 5th worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the 5th worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10):

20 / 10 = 2

The final answer is 2."
"To find the weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs to find the total weight:
15 + 30 = 45 pounds

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 45 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards.

Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. So, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers initially.

Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 2 * 16 = 32 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Luis had 32 stickers. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 2 * 32 = 64 stickers initially.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the distance Alfie needs to fly, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

The final answer is 50."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.
3. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so the speed of the faster car is 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we need to first find his age two years ago. 

Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can set up the equation: 
Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago

We know Liam's current age is 16, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Now, we can set up the equation: 
14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides by 2: 
Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7

Since Vince's age two years ago was 7, his current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, the number of eggs Madeline painted as M, the number of eggs Camden painted as C, and the number of eggs Sarah painted as S.

We know the following:
1. A = M (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

We can substitute the value of C from equation 3 into equation 2:
S + (S + 12) = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, we can find A:
A = M
A = 9

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 9
C - A = 12

The final answer is 12."
"To find the total weight of the crayons, we need to find out how many boxes Nik can fill with 200 crayons. 

Since each box can hold 8 crayons, we divide 200 by 8 to get the number of boxes: 
200 / 8 = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight of each box to get the total weight of the crayons:
25 * 8 = 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight of the crayons by 16 to get the weight in pounds:
200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons is 12.5 pounds."
"To find out how many logs John can make, we need to divide the total length of the tree by the length of each log.

Total length of the tree = 80 feet
Length of each log = 4 feet
Number of logs = Total length / Length of each log
= 80 / 4
= 20 logs

Since each log is cut into 5 planks, the total number of planks is:
Number of planks = Number of logs * 5
= 20 * 5
= 100 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so the total amount he makes is:
Total amount = Number of planks * Price per plank
= 100 * $1.2
= $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salaries of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since she earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, her brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we need to find their combined salary first. Valerie's salary is $5000 and her brother's salary is $10,000, so their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Now, their mother's salary is twice their combined salary, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk and then add it to the time spent on the beach.

First, we need to find the time spent on the sidewalk. Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes on the beach. So, she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk in 20 minutes.

Now, we can find the total time spent on the sidewalk: 20 minutes * 1 mile = 20 minutes.

Next, we add the time spent on the sidewalk to the time spent on the beach: 20 minutes + 40 minutes = 60 minutes.

The total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk is 60 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far.

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4 * 8 = $32

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount:
$60 - $32 = $28

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take to save the remaining amount of $28. Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add the number of blue birds in each tree.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so 3 x 7 = 21 blue birds.
2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so 2 x 4 = 8 blue birds.
1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles.

2. So, if Bob receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60. 
   Initial marbles = 60 - 24 = 36

3. Now, we know that Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36.
   Final marbles = 36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, let's start by assuming the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. 

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, the amount of water in the second mug is 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

Now, we know that the temperature of the water in the second mug is x degrees. We also know that the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees.

Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, we can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * x) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 132 = 5

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = -127

However, the temperature cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. This means that the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the second mug is x degrees. We know that the amount of water in the second mug is 1 ounce, and the amount of water in the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces.

We can set up the following equation:

(1 ounce * x) + (4 ounces * 33 degrees) = 5 ounces

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 132 = 5

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x = -127

However, the temperature cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug. This means that the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 40 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, three weeks will have 21 days (3 * 7).

Total number of cows added in 21 days: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added in 21 days: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs. 

Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost of 4 packs is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, and Russell ordered 4 packs, the total number of bagels is 9 * 4 = 36.

To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is $1.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Let's start by finding 3 less than 6: 6 - 3 = 3. 
Now, we need to find 1 less than 3: 3 - 1 = 2. 
So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's find 5 less than 23: 23 - 5 = 18.

Since it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, we can divide 18 scoops by 2 to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate: 18 / 2 = 9.

Therefore, Gomer ate 9 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs:

240 / 12 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, we can multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2.

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

The number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the number of lemons he gets in a year and then multiply it by 10.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, the total number of lemons he gets in a year is:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, let's multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year by 10 to find the total number of lemons he gets in a decade:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women on the bus, we first need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 9 = 14.

We can then divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 84 / 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part: 9 * 6 = 54.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

The number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first find out how many bouquets he sold. 

Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 per day, we can divide $56 by $8 to find out how many bouquets he sold per day. 

$56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets per day

Since he sold 7 bouquets per day for 3 days, we can multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many bouquets he sold in total. 

7 bouquets/day * 3 days = 21 bouquets

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can multiply 21 bouquets by 12 to find out how many sunflowers he sold in total. 

21 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 252 sunflowers

The final answer is: 252"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys and the total amount he earns from selling 60% of his inventory.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks:
Adam buys 100 rocks at $5 each, so the total cost is:
100 rocks * $5/rock = $500

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we need to find 60% of 100 rocks:
60% of 100 = 0.6 * 100 = 60 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total amount he earns from selling 60 rocks:
60 rocks * $7/rock = $420

To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the total amount he earns from the total cost:
$500 (total cost) - $420 (total earnings) = $80

Adam loses $80.

"To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

For large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
For medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
For small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum number of days, which is 9 days for the large-sized picture scenes.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 9 days to complete the project.

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

First, we need to convert ""three dozen"" to a numerical value. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4):

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total number of days in May (31 days) and multiply it by the daily cost of food per fish.

Since Jen has 3 fish, the total daily cost of food is 3 * $1 = $3.

The total cost for the month of May is 31 days * $3 = $93.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells each person initially collected.

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells.

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (2x + 5) = total number of seashells

Combine like terms:
5x + 5 = total number of seashells

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got:

(5x + 5) / 3

However, we still need to find the value of 'x'. We can do this by using the information that Jim collected 27 seashells. We know that Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 5 = 27

Subtract 5 from both sides:
2x = 22

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 11

Now that we know 'x', we can find the total number of seashells:
5x + 5 = 5(11) + 5 = 56

Now, divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got:
(5x + 5) / 3 = (56) / 3 = 18.67

Since we can't divide seashells into fractions, we can round down to 18 seashells per person.

The final answer is 18."
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. 
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days in a week.
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by multiplying the length of the first song by 1.6 (100% + 60% = 160%, or 1.6 times the original length).

Length of the second song = 5 minutes * 1.6 = 8 minutes

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time.

Total time = 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday = 2 * $20 = $40
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday = 4 * $20 = $80
Total cost = $40 + $80 = $120

The selling price of each device is twice the cost, so the selling price of each device is 2 * $20 = $40.
The total selling price of 6 devices = 6 * $40 = $240

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost.
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $240 - $120
= $120

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

"To find the total energy demand of 2300 people, we need to calculate 20% of the daily energy demand per person and then multiply it by 2300.

Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we can assume that 1 bottle covers 0.2 units of energy. 

The total energy demand of 2300 people is 2300 * 0.2 = 460 units.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 460 units of energy.

Number of bottles required = Total energy demand / Energy per bottle
= 460 / 0.2
= 2300

Since Hortex already produces 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand.

Additional bottles required = Total bottles required - Bottles already produced
= 2300 - 4200
= -1900

However, this is not possible as Hortex cannot produce a negative number of bottles. This means that the initial assumption of 20% of the daily energy demand per person is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

If 4200 bottles cover 20% of the daily energy demand of 1 person, then 1 bottle covers 0.2/4200 = 0.000476 units of energy.

The total energy demand of 2300 people is 2300 * 0.2 = 460 units.

Number of bottles required = Total energy demand / Energy per bottle
= 460 / 0.000476
= 967,000

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand.

Additional bottles required = Total bottles required - Bottles already produced
= 967,000 - 4200
= 962,800

The final answer is: 962,800"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find the total number of babies wearing purple and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies (since it's an octuplets). 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, so the number of purple wearers is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, so the number of purple wearers with bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the purple wearers with bows and the blue wearers with bows. Since 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, the number of blue wearers is 1/4 * 8 = 2. The number of blue wearers with bows is 1/3 * 2 = 2/3.

Now, we can find the total number of babies wearing bows: 2 (purple with bows) + 2/3 (blue with bows) = 8/3.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of purple wearers with bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100.

Probability = (2 / (8/3)) * 100 = (2 * 3 / 8) * 100 = 75%

The final answer is 75%."

Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received in the first two days = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract the total reports received in the first two days from the total number of reports received last week:
5168 - 4043 = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from each sale.

Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. So, he earned $50 from this sale.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, he earned $30 from this sale.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he earned $3 * 20 = $60 from this sale.

To find the total amount of money Abraham earned, we add the money from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. 

Half of Haley's age is 26 / 2 = 13.

"To find the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day and then multiply it by 2.

Since Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks per day.

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex. 

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments combined. 

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, he collects garbage 3 * 1040 = 3120 times a week.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation:
B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation:
R = 4B

Now, we are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Rissa was given initially. 

Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount left with Rissa is 15 - x.

We know that the amount left with Rissa is 4/5 of her initial amount, so we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

15 - x = 12

x = 3

So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. Now, we know that Rissa was left with 15 - 3 = $12.

Since Rissa gave $3 to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to her sister.

Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie was given $5, and she gave $3 to her sister, so the amount left with Ronnie is:

5 - 3 = $2

x (red) + x (white) + x (purple) + x (yellow) = 12

Combine like terms:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Since x represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

"To find the number of cycles, we first need to find the cost of the new box. Since the price remains the same, the new box will have 20% more pods, which means it will have 120 pods (100 + 20% of 100).

The cost of the new box is still $12. To find the cost per pod, we divide the cost by the number of pods: 
$12 / 120 pods = $0.1 per pod.

Now, we can find the number of cycles for $1 by dividing $1 by the cost per pod:
$1 / $0.1 per pod = 10 cycles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since 1000 / 20 = 50, he initially has 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he now has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he pays with 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he had 20 bills, tripling it means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has 60 bills, he now has 60 * 5 = 300 5 dollar bills.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, team B scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half. Therefore, team A scores 1/4 of 8, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by both teams in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals."
"To find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday, we need to calculate 45% of the total 5-inch piece of chalk.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Since the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, he recycled the chalk after using 2.25 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.25 inches at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. 

20% of 2.25 = 0.20 * 2.25 = 0.45

Since the teacher has already used 2.25 inches, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining 0.45 inches.

0.45 / 0.20 = 2.25

Since the teacher has already used 2.25 inches, we need to add 1 day to the result.

x = 2.25 + 1 = 3.25

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number.

x = 4

The teacher will have 4 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity.

Number of girls on varsity = 1/3 * 12 = 4
Number of boys on varsity = 1/4 * 12 = 3

Total number of students on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7

Total number of students in the class = 12 + 12 = 24

Number of students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity

3 * 5 = 15
15 + 2 = 17

Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To find the total number of teeth fixed, we need to add the number of teeth drilled and capped. 

Number of teeth drilled = 4
Number of teeth capped = 7 + 4 (since 7 more than 4) = 11

Total number of teeth James has = 30

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To find the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of 4000 gallons.

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5
= 8000 / 5
= 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus is returning 1600 gallons of milk at a cost of $3.5 per gallon, we need to calculate the total refund amount.

Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5
= $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5/3)C + 35/3

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total with $27000.

Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the cost of one book by dividing $500 by 100 books.

Cost per book = $500 / 100 books = $5 per book

Now, we can find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by the cost per book.

Total books = $27000 / $5 per book = 5400 books

Since Bob is distributing the books to 3 schools, we can divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = 5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school

The final answer is: 1800"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Newton had 2 apples.
2. He picked up 1 apple and put it in his pocket, leaving him with 1 apple.
3. He threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So now, he has 1 (from the pocket) + 5 (from the tree) = 6 apples.
4. He picked up all but 1 of these apples, leaving him with 5 apples.
5. He threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. So now, he has 5 (from his pocket) + 6 (from the tree) = 11 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 11 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to divide the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags.

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18) to find the total cost.

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices per friend is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many of each pizza Kate needs, we can divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza.

For cheese pizza: 60 / 12 = 5
For pepperoni pizza: 60 / 8 = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices for her friends."
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add the miles he ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the miles he ran on Tuesday and Thursday.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour. 

60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to determine how old John was when Digimon was released. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim at the time of the release, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote Jim's age at the time of the release as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim, John's age at the time of the release would be 2x.

We know that the time difference between John's current age (28) and his age at the time of the release is 20 years. So, we can set up the equation:

28 - 2x = 20

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 28 - 20
2x = 8
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age at the time of the release:

Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to calculate the number of slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6 slices.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the total number of bandages at the end of the first day is x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the second day is (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, so they had x - 16 + 100 = x + 84 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The total number of bandages at the end of the third day is (x + 84) - 25 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

3. Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total becomes 90 + 80 = 170 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 290."

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

So, the total amount Stephen owes is $300 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $306.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is $25 * 11 = $275.

Now, to find the amount he needs to pay in the 12th month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes: $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 4 grades (4-7), and each grade has 10 students. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40 students.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we can divide the total number of students by 8 to find the total number of groups:

40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, the total time required is:

5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

225"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames separately.

The cost of 4 tables is 4 * $20 = $80.
The cost of 2 roof frames is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"To find the length of the longer piece, we need to divide the total length of the board by 5, since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. 

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length is 4x. The sum of the lengths of both pieces is equal to the total length of the board, which is 40 feet.

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:
5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:
x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:
4x = 4 * 8 = 32

So, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds needed.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Since Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2 to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we multiply the number of windows by the width of each window.

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 * $0.25 = $4.00.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is 20 * $0.2 = $4.00.

The total cost is the sum of these two parts: $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to first calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Then, we add 1 more inch to this amount, so the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'. Then, the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since the total number of treats is 10, we can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4: c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we first need to calculate the discount for getting both services. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for getting both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

The discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art services (5 for her fingers and 5 for her toes). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year will send 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year will send 1 * 6 = 6 issues.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to calculate the price after each discount.

Initial price in November: $40
Price in December after 80% increase: 
$40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + (0.8 * $40) = $40 + $32 = $72

Price in January after 50% decrease from December:
$72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0.5 * $72) = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard lessons and the amount he earns from the lessons with veterans.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. 
4 lessons * $80 per hour = $320

For the lessons with veterans, Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 25% off the standard rate. 
The standard rate is $80 per hour, so the reduced rate is $80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.
2 lessons * $60 per hour = $120

Now, we add the amount earned from the standard lessons and the amount earned from the lessons with veterans.
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores:

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine how many pomelos she had left. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can calculate it as follows:

Original amount = 20
Amount left = 1/4 * 20 = 5

Since she had 5 pomelos left, we can subtract this from the original amount to find out how many pomelos she gave away:

Pomelos given away = Original amount - Amount left
= 20 - 5
= 15

The final answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the number of apples Walter ate: 
   2/5 of 60 apples = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples

2. Calculate the remaining number of apples after Walter ate 24 apples:
   60 - 24 = 36 apples

3. Calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister:
   25% of 36 apples = (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples

4. Calculate the remaining number of apples after Walter gave 9 apples to his sister:

So, Regina has written 36 novels this year.

36"
"To find the total distance covered by Michael, we need to multiply his average speed by the number of hours he traveled. 

Since he traveled for 3 days, we need to convert the days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by Michael:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards.

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline. So, her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week, we need to calculate the cost of pasta and cheese.

Cost of pasta per week: $1.00
Cost of cheddar cheese per week: $3.00
Cost of gruyere cheese per week: 2 * $3.00 = $6.00
Total cost of cheese per week: $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00
Total cost per week: $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to multiply the total cost per week by 52 weeks in a year.

Total cost per year: $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total time spent cleaning classrooms, we need to multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom.

Total time spent cleaning classrooms = 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Now, we need to find the total number of hours the custodian works in 5 days:
Total hours worked = 5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total time spent cleaning classrooms by the total hours worked and multiply by 100:

"To find the number of bookcases Elly needs, we need to determine the number of books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since the middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the middle 2 shelves: 10 + 10 = 20 books.

The total capacity of all the shelves is 20 (bottom) + 20 (middle) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of them, as 110 is greater than 55."
"To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost of the eggs:
5 dozens of eggs = 5 * 12 = 60 eggs

Total cost = 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozen
Total cost = 5 * $2.40 = $12

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Rose sells 3 eggs for $1
Number of eggs in 5 dozens = 60 eggs
Number of sets of 3 eggs = 60 eggs / 3 eggs per set = 20 sets
Total revenue = 20 sets * $1 per set = $20

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost of each stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks:
$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly in both tests.

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate the total number of questions as follows:

Total questions = (70% of 110) + 40
Total questions = (0.7 * 110) + 40
Total questions = 77 + 40
Total questions = 117

Now, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test:

Questions correct on the first test = 60% of 70
Questions correct on the first test = (0.6 * 70)
Questions correct on the first test = 42

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can set up an equation:

(42 + x) / 117 = 0.7

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 117:

42 + x = 0.7 * 117
42 + x = 81.9

Now, we can subtract 42 from both sides:

x = 81.9 - 42
x = 39.9

Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 39.9 is closer to 40 than 40 is to 39.9, so we can round down to 40.

Audrey needs to get 40 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is 'x'. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4

5. Now, he has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Step 2: Calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get from potential customers.
Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers to get 15 customers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 potential customers.
Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated, Jason needs 30 / 1 = 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 potential customers.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To find the total time, we need to calculate the time for each side of the Rubik's cube.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
- The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all the sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"To find the total number of items, we need to first find the number of robots and footballs.

Since there are 20 helmets and there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can set up an equation: 
20 = (1/2) * x, where x is the number of footballs.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 20 * 2
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 footballs, we can find the number of robots, which is half as many as helmets:
Robots = (1/2) * 20
Robots = 10

Now we have the number of robots (10), helmets (20), and footballs (40). To find the total number of items, we add them together:

Total items = 70

The total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week.

Since Tim spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes as follows:

6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day

Since Tim works 5 days a week, we multiply the daily minutes by 5:

360 minutes/day * 5 days = 1800 minutes

Now, we know it takes 15 minutes to deal with a call. To find the total number of calls, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call:

1800 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

"To find the difference in drying time, we need to calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings and the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting. So, for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time it would take for the old varnish from the time it would take for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

Since Phineas needs to cover half the distance on land and half the distance in water, the total distance he needs to cover is 200 yards. 

Half of 200 yards is 100 yards. 

Time taken to hop on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.

Time taken to swim in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to break down the information given.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the total number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the total number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

Now, we know the number of people on the first three days: 50, 70, and 140. 

Since Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (5 days), the total number of people for those 5 days is 60 * 5 = 300.

Now, we add up the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days and the total number of people for the rest of the week: 50 + 70 + 140 + 300 = 460.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount (3 * 20 = 60) pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate (4 * 20 = 80 kernels).
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds (half of 80 is 40 kernels).
5. The total number of kernels popped in the first 3 sets of 30 seconds is 20 + 60 + 80 = 160 kernels.
6. In the final 30 seconds, 40 kernels popped, making the total 160 + 40 = 200 kernels.
7. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 10 kernels.
8. The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is: 210"
"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for 5 gallons of lemonade. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon as follows:
6 lemons / 1 cup = 6 lemons per cup

Now, we multiply this by 5 gallons to get the total lemons needed for 5 gallons:
6 lemons/cup * 5 gallons = 30 lemons

Since Tim wants to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for this extra gallon. Since it's twice as tart, it will require half the amount of juice as the other gallons:
1 cup * 2 = 2 cups for the extra gallon

Now, we calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon:
6 lemons/cup * 2 cups = 12 lemons

Now, we add the lemons needed for the 5 gallons and the extra gallon:
30 lemons + 12 lemons = 42 lemons

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount of dog food needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The total daily consumption is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Now, multiply the total daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption:
21 kg * 7 = 147 kg

The Kennel house will need 147 kg of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs of all the animals and then divide by 2.

2-legged animals: 10 * 2 = 20 legs
4-legged animals: 15 * 4 = 60 legs

Total number of legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs

Now, divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of pairs of legs:
80 / 2 = 40 pairs

The final answer is 40."
"To find the number of red blocks, we need to first find the total number of blue and yellow blocks.

We know there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks is 32 - 12 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

Final answer: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after Year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after Year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after Year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

We know that the bag has 54 red candies. 
The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.
The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, and yellow) = 43

The number of pink candies is 43."
"To find the total cost of the hotel, we can multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights: 
$80 * 3 = $240

To find the cost of one bus trip, we need to calculate 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel:
10% of $80 = 0.1 * $80 = $8

Now, we can find the total cost of the bus trips by multiplying the cost of one bus trip by the number of bus trips:
$8 * 7 = $56

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips:
$240 + $56 = $296

The final answer is: $296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially. 

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we need to add those 4 back to find the initial amount: 
21 + 4 = 25

Since Mazie gave 52 marbles to the twins, and we now know Dallas initially had 25, we can subtract 25 from 52 to find out how many marbles Darla received:
52 - 25 = 27

The final answer is 27."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns separately.

The cost of the tickets:
- 2 adult tickets: 2 * $12 = $24
- 1 child ticket: $8
Total cost of tickets: $24 + $8 = $32

The cost of the popcorns: 2 * $3 = $6

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns:
$32 (tickets) + $6 (popcorns) = $38

The family pays a total of $38."
"To find the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, luggage, and the children.

Weight of the car = 1200 pounds
Weight of luggage = 250 pounds
Weight of the children = 2 * 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To find the total length of crepe paper needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the rectangle. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Given the length (long side) is 20 feet and the width (short side) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of their ages, we need to first find Emma's age. Since Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we have both their ages, we can find the average by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to add the number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Total seashells = Tom's seashells + Nancy's seashells + Benny's seashells

"To find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day, we need to multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day. 

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Now, we subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total amount of feed ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is 20."
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs in total, we need to calculate the number of hot dogs the guests will eat and add the leftover hot dogs.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs needed: 20 * 2 = 40

Adding the leftover hot dogs: 40 + 4 = 44

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, we need to divide the total number of hot dogs needed by 6 to find out how many packs John needs to buy.

44 / 6 = 7.33 (round up to 8 since you can't buy a fraction of a pack)

So, John needs to buy 8 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost will be:
8 * $2 = $16

The final answer is: $16"

James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to find the age of the older brother first. 

Since one brother is 12 years old and that is half the age of the older brother, we can find the older brother's age by multiplying 12 by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the older brother is 24 years old, we can find the total age of the siblings. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the brothers and the sisters. 

The total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36. 
The total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48.

The total age of all the siblings is 36 + 48 = 84.

Time spent on meditation: 
- 15 minutes per day
- 2 times a day (morning and evening)
- 4 weeks
- 7 days a week
- 4 weeks = 28 days

Total time spent on meditation: 
15 minutes/day * 2 times/day * 28 days = 840 minutes

Time spent on yoga: 
- 1 hour per day
- 5 days a week
- 4 weeks = 20 days

Total time spent on yoga: 
1 hour/day * 5 days/week * 20 days = 100 hours

Total time spent on meditation and yoga: 
840 minutes + 100 hours
Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 
100 hours = 100 * 60 = 6000 minutes
Total time spent on meditation and yoga:

"To find the total number of seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower and the large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5:

50% of 36 = 36 * 0.5 = 18

Now, we add the 50% (18) to the number of seeds in the small sunflower (36) to find the number of seeds in the large sunflower:

36 + 18 = 54 seeds

Now, we add the number of seeds in the small sunflower (36) and the large sunflower (54) to find the total number of seeds:

36 + 54 = 90

"To find the total amount Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
- Original price of each T-shirt: $8
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 * $8 = $16
- Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.
- The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4
- The price of the second T-shirt after the discount is $8 - $4 = $4
- The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12

For the shoes:
- Original price of the shoes: $40
- Jake buys the shoes at 40% off, so the discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16
- The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
$12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many holes Nate needs to fill.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled per day is:
9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

We also know that Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so we can set up the equation:

T + B + P = 29

We know that T = 8 and P = 16, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

8 + B + 16 = 29

Now, let's solve for B:

B = 29 - 8 - 16
B = 5

So, Igor gathered 5 beakers.

Since Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of screws needed, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Number of tables: 4
Number of legs per table: 4
Number of screws per leg: 2

Total screws needed = 4 * 4 * 2 = 32

James has 40 screws. To find the number of screws left over, we subtract the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

40 - 32 = 8

James will have 8 screws left over."
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 2 * 10 = 20

Total number of eggs in both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then add them together.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances.

Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed would be 'x/2' miles per minute.

We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since her speed is 'x/2' miles per minute, we can find her time by dividing the distance by her speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (x/2)
Time = 8 / x

We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is 'x' miles per minute, we can find his distance by multiplying his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = x * 16
Distance = 16x

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:

4 = 2 * 16x
4 = 32x

Now, we can solve for 'x':

x = 4 / 32
x = 1/8

Now that we know 'x', we can find Vanessa's time:

Time = 8 / x
Time = 8 / (1/8)
Time = 8 * 8
Time = 64

The final answer is 64."
"To find the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Since the caretaker already has 6 feet of line, we subtract this from the total required.

600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To find the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue:
- 6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation = 12 meals
- 12 meals * $5 per meal = $60
- Adding the $5 bottle of wine, the daily revenue is $60 + $5 = $65

Weekly revenue:
- $65 per day * 2 days per week = $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to first find the total cost of all the watermelons and then calculate the selling price.

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Since the profit is 25%, we can find the cost price of one watermelon by dividing the total cost by 50 and then multiplying by 100 to get the cost price.

Cost price of one watermelon = (Total cost / 50) * 100
= ($80 / 50) * 100
= $160

Now, we can find the selling price of one watermelon by adding 25% of the cost price to the cost price.

Selling price of one watermelon = Cost price + (Cost price * 25%)
= $160 + ($160 * 0.25)
= $160 + $40
= $200

The selling price of each watermelon is $200."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.
2. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.
3. John had James when he was 19, so John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.
5. In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference in the number of oranges they peel.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. 

In 1 hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.
Jane will peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To find the cost of the radiator, we need to calculate 80% of the original price and then subtract that from the original price.

80% of $400 = 0.8 * 400 = $320
$400 - $320 = $80

Now, let's calculate the cost of the labor. 
3 hours * $50 per hour = $150

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.
$80 + $150 = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. 

Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'b'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation: c + b = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write another equation: 2c + 4b = 70.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'c' by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2c + 4b = 70
2(c + b) = 2(20)
2c + 2b = 40

Subtracting the two equations:
(2c + 4b) - (2c + 2b) = 70 - 40
2b = 30

Dividing both sides by 2:
b = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting 'b' into the first equation:
c + 15 = 20
c = 5

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people (Henry and 3 friends) who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

Each person can have 14 slices."
